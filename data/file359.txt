3590007 cyberbullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
3590008 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
3590009 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
3590010 moreover the vehicle for the cyberbullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000

3590020 situasi pertandingan sangat ketat saya sempat merasa skor 2 2 akan bertahan tapi kemudian muncul penalti yang aneh dan kami mulai kehilangan konsentrasi kenyataan ini sulit untuk diterima keputusan penting menyangkut penalti di dua laga perempatfinal ini telah merugikan kami
3590021 saya telah melihat tayangan lambat di ruang ganti jatuhnya ryan babel di kotak penalti kami bukanlah sebuah pelanggaran sekarang kami harus bersiap menghadapi manchester united di liga dan berusaha untuk tetap tampil maksimal tapi saya tetap merasa diperlakukan tidak adil

3590037 because i dont think theres a lot of stigma in saying youre voting for john mccain
3590038 do you want to vote for the white guy or the black guy
3590039 the real frailty of our polls is that we get very high refusal rates and we survive because the people who we interview are like the people who we dont interview on most things
3590040 and to be honest with you this is something every pollster i know is concerned about
3590041 it was clear that people were having the first opportunity to vote for an african american and there was uncertainty
3590042 you know is he going to be fair is he just going to look out for his own people and who are his own people i think weve come a great distance from that ive seen the progress
3590043 racial attitudes and stereotypes that people in many cases are not aware they have
3590044 i dont think anyone is correct or incorrect including me
3590045 to get to the heart of that youd have to do the kinds of research that havent been done
3590046 i wouldnt want to be barack obama and up two points going into election day
3590047 my guess is that the obama campaign understands that and they know its not enough to be ahead

3590053 in our view the web is built by people we are using all this human contribution through our algorithms the final ordering of the results is decided by our algorithms using the contributions of the greater internet community not manually by us we believe that the subjective judgment of any individual is well subjective and information distilled by our algorithms from the vast amount of human knowledge encoded in the web pages and their links is better than individual subjectivity
3590054 we had a very good dialogue i was able to get a sense of his soul

3590084 tell me exactly what the results said word for word and dont leave a thing out
3590085 its hard for us to understand what the russian plan is
3590086 that support is aimed at encouraging the rise of georgia as an independent sovereign state
3590087 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3590088 lack of a neutral and effective peacekeeping force operating under an appropriate u n mandate
3590089 we can spend a little more time working a case this is our priority right now
3590090 its no coincidence that the vehicles were dumped so close to each other somebody out here knows who did this
3590091 were just talking to people here today doing an area canvass
3590092 wait and see how he is going to react when he gets fired by abc news without a reason just because he is skinny like a monkey
3590093 the reason for firing was that theyre changing formats which they didnt really
3590094 weve been there loyal with the company and they didnt change the music a lot
3590095 a company shouldnt be able to say a 36 year old fellow would do it better than the 52 year old fellow
3590096 ive fired several disc jockeys we are in a business of change many people on the radio station who have worked there 15 20 years dont fit there anymore they might not sound age wise proper theres ethics here but then theres reality

3590100 i dont think he is at all lester you know if anything sure that they lose a good surrogate this was a guy who was very good on the stump
3590101 is there any stomach for john mccain perhaps using taking some political advantage of this or will he simply leave this alone as a third rail
3590102 not at all theyre probably going to leave this alone john mccain had to deal with a story that their campaign was very upset about that the new york times did theyre not going to touch this you know stuff like this usually ends up getting swept under the rug pretty quickly
3590103 can the right wing withstand yet another scandal involving one of its own
3590104 tvone tidak pegang lagi liga inggris karena tawaran paketnya sama dengan tahun lalu
3590105 sebenarnya kami meminta paket yang lebih baik dari tahun lalu namun espn meminta izin untuk membicarakan hal tersebut dengan pihak astro terlebih dahulu
3590106 tvone kan pemegang first option jadi penawarannya ke kita dulu kalau kita tidak ambil baru ditawarkan kepada televisi lain
3590107 belum ada kepastian indikasi untuk menyiarkan memang ada tapi kami masih belum bisa memastikan yang pasti untuk tahun 2009 kami akan mencoba mendapatkan hak siarnya
3590108 you shouldnt put yourself in that kind of a situation
3590109 i was hurting in miami but i still could have been out there and pitched
3590110 youre going to go out there with bumps and bruises and dings most of the time you just have to deal with it
3590111 i threw 60 pitches in the simulated game almost at full speed and i felt okay and i feel okay now so im not really concerned
3590112 he put the caddy behind the building and wiped his face with his sleeve
3590113 she sat down leaving her coat on and bowed her head against the seat in front of her for several seconds and then raised it up weeping
3590114 put his hands on the sink and bowed his head and breathed in and out several times before raising his eyes to the mirror
3590115 seemed to well up and spill over suck back well up spill over
3590116 kids in the city are cut off from nature active outdoor living should be valued as much as indoor learning and nutrition
3590117 its important for kids to have an intimate relationship with the outside world
3590118 it all gives them a better sense of belonging and environmental responsibility
3590119 a schoolyard of asphalt thats filled with broken glass and trash sends a message to kids that we dont care
3590120 all of our schools now benefit from this effort as a result we can now provide our students with endless opportunities for creative learning physical activity and fun
3590121 the sky got completely dark and i could see the underbelly of the plane right over my head
3590122 it was almost like being on a movie set the plane crashed exploding into a big ball of fire
3590123 he just picked a spot where there were no cars
3590124 we all called 911 and ran over to the scene we couldnt believe it
3590125 im glad more people werent hurt but i cant get it all out of my head it was hard to see
3590126 i stopped to look for it because to hear a plane that low on a day like this when the weather isnt very good is unusual
3590127 it came out of the clouds in a nosedive the motor was still going it just spiraled down to the ground
3590128 theres not anybody like that anymore he was very in depth he covered his bases whatever he did he was well prepared just an all around wonderful person
3590129 will be fairly decent with a brief period of dryness
3590130 this person has keys to all of the classrooms all of the buildings all of the cabinets all of the closets he has total access
3590131 obviously in this case it helped us solve a crime
3590132 diprediksikan pertumbuhan penduduk di indonesia akan mencapai 300 juta jiwa jika tidak ada generasi muda yang bergelut dalam pertanian kita akan kesulitan nanti
3590133 kita sepatutnya berterima kasih dan memberikan penghargaan setinggi tingginya kepada ipb karena tanpa ipb pertanian di malaysia tidak akan semaju seperti sekarang ini
3590134 banyak yang belum tahu kontribusi ipb terhadap negara malaysia dan itu sangat penting sekali di malaysia ipb sangat terkenal dan di kalangan pendidikan ipb selalu disebut sebut
3590135 a loss of control could be caused if the pilot doesnt maintain airspeed the plane then goes into a stall and the nose will drop
3590136 the age of the airplane itself isnt an indicator of the air worthiness of the airplane
3590137 the approach is an interesting one but the actual impact will be pretty limited
3590138 im just not sure how many projects this will impact
3590139 whos going to pay for these flagmen to be trained whos going to pick up their unemployment insurance we just dont think the cost savings are there
3590140 this isnt over this draft is still in the workable stages
3590141 these reforms are real tangible changes and reforms of how we operate in massachusetts
3590142 it strikes the balances between taxpayer dollars and public safety
3590143 we are going to make another run at talking to him in boston at a future date
3590144 we really were looking for that spontaneous unscripted just very amusing meat maniac moment
3590145 shes very boing y all the time especially at feeding time
3590146 thats kind of what she does around the house she stands up for her own
3590147 the ramifications of this whole episode on me and the people in my life who matter most my family have been devastating and the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence has forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent

3590150 the actions of the georgian authorities in south ossetia are obviously a crime it is a crime against its own people first and foremost
3590151 the aggression has resulted in numerous victims including those among civilians and has virtually led to a humanitarian catastrophe
3590152 the city itself is ruined there is no food or water
3590153 there are so many dead bodies lying on the streets it reminds me of the world war ii
3590154 the position of the western media mirrors the public opinion in the west u s and british media outlets lay the entire blame for the conflict on russia and ossetian separatists whereas german and italian publications tend to take a more reasonable stance in their reports
3590155 since georgia launched a major ground and air offensive to seize control of south ossetia on friday
3590156 president medvedev has issued a decree declaring aug 13 a day of mourning in russia for the humanitarian disaster in south ossetia
3590157 the general staff of the russian armed forces believes georgias reports on alleged bombing of the baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline were aimed at drawing other states into the conflict as anatoly nogovitsyn deputy chief of general staff of russias armed forces stated today the reports aimed to get a response from turkey while a pipeline is not a worthy target for bombs
3590158 russias peacekeepers didnt enter georgia but for unrecognized abkhazia and south ossetia general staff deputy chief general colonel anatoly nogovitsyn specified during a briefing in moscow by making this statement the general refuted allegations of tbilisi about the capture of georgian towns by russian military
3590159 it sends a strong message that we are committed to bring the neighborhoods back that have been hit by the foreclosure crisis
3590160 we hope that this project will serve as a prototype
3590161 when a married man is getting 400 haircuts you can bet a bottle of brandy he is cheating on his wife
3590162 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
3590163 blijkbaar wil hij niet fit worden dan moet het dus maar zo
3590164 ik wil ook hem graag helpen maar ik twijfel of hij zich wil laten helpen ik heb ook niet het gevoel dat hij leert van zijn fouten
3590165 iedereen krijgt een tweede kans jonathan dus ook ik moet echter wel zeggen dat hij de deur behoorlijk dicht heeft gegooid ik ben benieuwd of hij op zoek gaat naar de sleutel we hebben hem meerdere malen gewaarschuwd maar ik twijfel of het allemaal aan hem ligt
3590166 mijn bril zat vol water de laatste honderd meter zag ik niks meer
3590167 het werd erger en erger op een gegeven moment zag ik de wand niet meer
3590168 maar ik wilde mijn wereldrecordverbreken dat is toch gelukt dus zo slechts is het niet
3590169 als je door het raam naar buiten kijkt zie je slechts smog geloof me de spelen zijn vuiler dan de lucht boven peking het zouden wel eens de vuilste spelen in de geschiedenis kunnen worden
3590170 we kunnen als knvb weer iets extras doen richting onze relaties zo nemen we ze niet alleen mee naar het voetbal maar bezoeken ook het judo en hockey om iedereen iets van de typisch olympische sfeer te laten proeven
3590171 eerlijk gezegd weet ik dat nog niet heeft ook te maken met de locaties waar we voetballen die zijn veel te ver verwijderd van peking als dat in de toekomst weer gebeurt dan heb ik zo mn twijfels ook zal de fifa de spelen beter in de reglementen moet omschrijven om voortaan onnodig gebakkelei met de clubs te voorkomen
3590172 we voetballen hier letterlijk en figuurlijk voor de eer dankzij onze sponsors unilever nationale nederlanden en nike zijn de kosten gedekt die verdienen echt een compliment omdat ze nog voor het laatste ek waar oranje zich nog voor peking moest kwalificeren red voor het olympische traject hebben gekozen daardoor kregen we als knvb lucht en komen we er straks wel uit
3590173 worden alle kosten door noc nsf betaald zoals het team ook qua verdiensten onder de olympische regels valt net als iedere andere atleet is een gouden medaille straks goed voor zon 10 000 euro per persoon als knvb doen we daar nog iets bij maar je kan toch vaststellen dat er hier redelijk voor de eer wordt gesport
3590174 zij hebben natuurlijk de olympische ervaring terwijl wij de beginneling zijn daarom verdient met name marcel sturkenboom directeur topsport noc nsf red een compliment voor zijn betrokkenheid richting ons zodra we wat hulp nodig hadden dan stond hij klaar echt prima
3590175 ik kan me daar eerlijk gezegd wel iets bij voorstellen
3590176 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3590177 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3590178 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3590179 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3590180 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3590181 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3590182 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3590203 they are as good as any other group we have taken to the competition
3590204 they have really extended themselves by grasping such a wide range of music and languages
3590205 were feeling pretty good and have a challenging variable set
3590206 we have been practising about four times a week recently and one of the rugby first xv came up to us to say we were really good when we performed at school assembly
3590207 theres a few new schools from the regions who are going to the finals this year that we dont know much about so well just have to see how it goes
3590208 its great that the big sing competition is in wellington as well get a lot of local support
3590209 its important to acknowledge what our heritage is and it is an important part of wellington
3590210 we dont want to do all this and then have a great big development go up because at the start of development it is just going to create dust and dirt and make a big mess of the site
3590211 we are disappointed we saw it as a community issue not just about the highest or lowest bidder
3590212 mt vic is not a big place it only has 5000 residents but we got stuck in and raised it had we got the grant i think the church would have sold it to us and lost out on just 50 000
3590213 suddenly the council became responsible for providing a community centre for mt vic i think its ironic that a congregation like st andrews which talks about social justice has done this
3590214 we were not able to provide the major subsidy that the trust requested
3590215 we are going to look around for something to lease either in mt vic or on its fringes says mr southworth
3590216 weve identified a couple of places but the cr che is in need of an outdoor area and that will be difficult to find
3590217 last year we looked at 26 different alternative options in the inner city mt victoria and the surrounding suburbs but they either were unsuitable in terms of the space or not available at the time we needed it
3590218 weve gone back to have another look at them recently and they are just not suitable
3590219 can you cover the big stories that really mean something to people how taxes are spent projections for jobs stuff you just need to know if you live here if you have too few journalists
3590220 thats a concern i have now as a journalist and as a citizen of new jersey
3590221 new jersey was a very strong real estate economy but it soured it is much more serious in new jersey than in any of the other markets that we are publishing in
3590222 those papers arent surrounded by water which believe me helps newsday a lot
3590223 it sort of insulates the long island market and newsday owns long island new jersey in the overall market is one of the most highly competitive markets in the country if you look at a map and see how many daily newspapers are in that part of new jersey its astounding
3590224 when i studied abroad in london one of the americans that i was with brought like a crazy amount of adderall everybody partied hard core for like three weeks
3590225 so i go downstairs earlier to get some ice and the security guard comes up and says you remember me from last night
3590226 its been the slowest month of the season as far as like weekends in new york go in the summertime
3590227 i dont think willets and hunters point south and coney island are necessarily without precedent
3590228 the model is taking on big projects the scope and magnitude of which havent ever been tackled before by city government
3590229 my concern was just that there would be a little burst of interest in my book and that would be the end of it
3590230 its a paradox of course you want your book to get a lot of attention but the best way sometimes the only way to get that sort of attention is to find a way to spin your book as newsy but the obvious downside is the risk that youll be pigeonholing your book as a sort of current events book that doesnt have any enduring importance you kinda cant have it both ways i guess
3590231 it really interestingly is a book that is oddly hopeful thats not where people are yet theyll get there once they pick it up and read it
3590232 i think with this book too many people are just focusing on the fake letters of course that makes headlines that drive book sales but youve written about many other things that are much more important for the future of this country
3590233 look there are parts of the book readers read it and weep and i kind of wept as i wrote parts of it it was a moving journey
3590234 i want to assure you that army chief general kayani is highly professional and he is pro democracy
3590235 i want to assure you that army chief general kayani is highly professional and he is pro democracy
3590236 it really hasnt sunk in for me yet what has happened at this meet
3590237 it was great for me to qualify next to natalie coughlin because she takes it out so hard
3590238 and i knew kirsty coventry would be there all the way so i tried not to look at her and just concentrated on what i was doing

3590243 its given me a way to get inside wellington i have been able to get down deep and really understand what its like to live here
3590244 i love wellington because it combines the metropolitan lifestyle with the tramping and hiking and the outdoor experience you can walk a kilometre from your doorstep and find a beautiful view

3590247 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
3590248 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
3590249 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
3590250 there is a need to focus greater attention on what type of functions should be contracted out and which ones should not
3590251 a major concern is the risk of loss of government control over and accountability for mission related policy and program decisions

3590257 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3590258 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be the biggest environmental disaster of all time
3590259 its not going backwards it is actually recognising that we are with nature not against it we have gone working against nature for too long
3590260 we are absolutely becoming veteran central serving our veterans where they live by the kind of folks they need to take care of them when they need to be taken care of

3590263 the prime minister of new zealand angrily denounced israel and imposed diplomatic sanctions on it after two suspected mossad agents were jailed for six months for trying on false grounds to obtain a new zealand passport the plot which involved obtaining a passport in the name of a tetraplegic man who had not spoken in years provoked a furious reaction yesterday
3590264 in 2004 new zealand authorities became aware of a covert operation mounted by israels external intelligence agency mossad to secure nz passports which are keenly sought after by those who seek hassle free entry to most countries
3590265 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3590266 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3590267 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation
3590268 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson

3590270 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3590271 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3590272 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3590273 i would have liked to medal but i got my first personal best of the meet and i think thats a good effort
3590274 i cant be upset with that and im just moving on to the next heat
3590275 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules

3590284 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3590285 i think whats interesting is after all these years that ted kaczynski would be concerned about the exhibits impact on his victims
3590286 they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights
3590287 why is it always up to the united states for the most part to fix problems why are we the only ones that are able to realize evil and wrongdoing when we see it putin and russia are acting like bullies and they will continue to be bullies until they face pressure we all know that russia wouldnt stop just at georgia what comes next russia is trying to intimidate all the surrounding nations because they dont want them to support western style governments
3590288 they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights
3590289 i think sir alex realises we werent too far away from united when they were at the very top of their game
3590290 i dont think united have another level to go to they had a lot of players in their team who have been at the peak of their form for the last two years
3590291 rio ferdinand has been awesome for the last two years and cristiano ronaldo was unbelievable i dont think youll see that again
3590292 with it being that close in the premier league and champions league they know well give them a big run for their money
3590293 we were the nearly team last year almost won the carling cup almost won the champions league almost won the premier league
3590294 at 66 i cant be involved in everything and ive learned to let the excellent staff here get on with it
3590295 theres no question that obsession can be a handicap and is also dangerous for your health it got to that point for me about 10 years ago i was involved in everything at the club the academy the youth teams all the scouting it was obsession and it was draining me
3590296 weve been saying youre missing a great opportunity to get more of your people in here to celebrate your games
3590297 i would want to stress how important it is for the host city that the venues are seen to be full and

3590302 the weak dollar has become a major driver of economic growth
3590303 in the short term it is business as usual we dont rely on dr thaksins money
3590304 when mark hughes makes a decision we go through the normal process which can include banks finance or a whole bunch of different things just like any other club
3590305 he is willing to look at whatever it takes to make city a great football club
3590306 i gave him an update on the club and we talked about new player acquisitions
3590307 we also talked over dinner about why he had bought the club and his intentions
3590308 it was really clear he wants to be at this football club for the next 10 years
3590309 the weak dollar has become a major driver of economic growth
3590310 the dollar is probably where it should be as it has made us products competitive in a world where global trade is central to economic growth
3590311 us growth is doing much better than domestic spending would indicate both because exports are booming and because some of the weakness in domestic demand is being passed on to the rest of the world through lower imports
3590312 the spirit is right the team responded well as did the crowd so im satisfied
3590313 we need the two weeks of training before the second leg because as could be seen we arent continuously sharp yet but we were also quite tidy today

3590316 will be to transform the top 10 quotes which apparently arent quotes into i will statements
3590317 its best when employees are confident that we have a decent plan
3590318 but but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to
3590319 its wonderful the relationship is new for both of us she sometimes calls me 50 times a day and asks me things that light my life up but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot
3590320 war prosperity is like the prosperity that an earthquake or a plague brings
3590321 war is harmful not only to the conquered but to the conqueror
3590322 to defeat the aggressors is not enough to make peace durable the main thing is to discard the ideology that generates war
3590323 the root of the evil is not the construction of new more dreadful weapons it is the spirit of conquest
3590324 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation

3590330 what happened was that during a photo session where the spanish national team was unveiled one of our sponsors asked us to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing and we made an oriental expression with our eyes
3590331 it seemed to us to be something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3590332 however some european media did not see it as such
3590333 i want to express that we have great respect for the orient and its people some of my best friends in toronto are of chinese origin
3590334 spanish sports poor reputation for insensitivity towards racial issues has been further harmed by the advert
3590335 ad was unlikely to go down well with olympics hosts china and could well spoil spains hopes of hosting the olympic games in madrid in 2016 or 2020
3590336 its a racially pejorative pose not often associated with goodwill in the united states and many other countries where a similar gesture is more likely to be seen on a school playground than coming from olympic statesman
3590337 its something that i havent seen since i was a kid
3590338 i cant speak for what is considered funny in spain i dont know if it has the same impact that it would here
3590339 its clearly racist and not even in a jovial way

3590363 senator obama has promised to change the way things are done in washington and this step is a sure sign of his commitment the american peoples priorities will set the agenda in an obama administration not the special interests
3590364 obviously i cut it a bit fine in the heats
3590365 but i had a bit left in the tank for this morning

3590377 natural inorganic cation exchange materials such as clays and zeolites have been extensively studied and used in the removal of radioactive ions from water via ion exchange and are subsequently disposed of in a safe way
3590378 however synthetic inorganic cation exchange materials such as synthetic micas g zirconium phosphate niobate molecular sieves and titanate have been found to be far superior to natural materials in terms of selectivity for the removal of radioactive cations from water radioactive cations are preferentially exchanged with sodium ions or protons in the synthetic material more importantly a structural collapse of the exchange materials occurs after the ion exchange proceeds to a certain extent thereby forming a stable solid with the radioactive cations being permanently trapped inside hence the immobilized radioactive cations can be disposed safely
3590379 generally ion exchange materials exhibiting a layered structure are less stable than those with 3d crystal structures and the collapse of the layers can take place under moderate conditions
3590380 then again it has also been found that nanoparticles of inorganic solids readily react with other species or are quickly converted to other crystal phases under moderate conditions and thus are substantially less stable than the corresponding bulk material
3590381 the novelty of our project is that the adsorption of bivalent toxic radioactive cations by the nanofibers finally induces structure collapse and deformation of the nanofibers which permanently locks in the toxic radioactive cations
3590382 the permanent entrapment prevents the radioactive cations to be released from the adsorbents and assures that they can be safely disposed furthermore the titanate nanofiber can selectively remove the radioactive ions in the presence of plentiful competitive ions
3590383 the most important finding by us is the nanofibers can trap the toxic radioactive cations permanently

3590389 we do a circuit of paw paw to hancock every weekend
3590390 i only said that to get your number i hate being outdoors hate it
3590391 but you told me that you were a kayaker you were going to give me lessons
3590392 nope no ive never been kayaking i just lied to get you on this date do you want to order appetizers
3590393 and i feel like im completely drunk not that id actually know what drunk feels like
3590394 sure i mean everyone has been drunk a few times college or back in high school
3590395 it sounds like youre on a date with an alcoholic how do you feel about this
3590396 what im not an alcoholic ive just been drunk a few times
3590397 denial is one of the warning signs aaron it sounds like you have a real live wire on your hands
3590398 now she sounds belligerent aaron shes probably drunk right now she probably had to booze it up just to pull herself together for this date shell probably be dead in a few years cirrhosis of the liver this is not the type of woman you want to get involved with bring home to the family its actually very sad
3590399 lets not talk about alcohol lets just get through this date okay so melissa what do you like to do at night
3590400 shes still denying it its really pathetic shes a graduate student and she cant even pull herself together to admit that she has a problem you have to concentrate you need to get her off this topic melissa i dont know this area very well where do you hang out
3590401 i dont know i mean last night a few of us went down to the national cathedral and ran through the garden maze
3590402 i knew you shouldnt have asked this girl out what a live wire a true daredevil running around at the cathedral trespassing probably littering smoking joints and drinking alcohol doing who knows what else its so sad its such a shame she seems like such a nice jewish girl but shes just like the others an alcoholic littering live wire daredevil throwing her life around like it was garbage
3590403 i dont know if we need to get through this whole date i think that maybe we should just be satisfied that we tried this and get through the rest of dinner and call it a night
3590404 maryland and here so two places where have you lived
3590405 well maryland and i went to college at harvard so boston
3590406 and then i did my masters work at yale so new haven
3590407 i got my phd in michigan ann arbor and now i live here madison for my post doc
3590408 youre being ridiculous weve gotten along great age hasnt matter until this point
3590409 can you get off of the age thing we have a lot in common
3590410 but i mean what would a 33 year old with several degrees want with a 20 year old college student
3590411 i think youre very mature and we have great conversations right havent we had great conversations up until now
3590412 lets just relax order some food you know you never finished that story last night about how you knew my parents neighbourhood in maryland
3590413 its stupid my grandparents live there and we used to go over to their house to go swimming
3590414 of course i know them im friends with their son wait you dated fred fred forester
3590415 hes actually older than me and we dated for two years i dated your friends son
3590416 not heckle them why would we heckle them to join them to spread the word
3590417 so yes i think its first date material so melissa i guess this means that you dont care about the lives of poor innocent babies
3590418 but i also care about each person having a right to say what their body endures
3590419 and you believe the solution is to allow women to be murderers cold hearted ruthless irresponsible murders
3590420 you know it always bothers me when men have an opinion about this considering they will never have to carry the child in their body until you are biologically equipped to be affected by the situation i dont know how you have any say i really think we should drop this topic why dont you just drive me home
3590421 the whole abortion thing aside i had a really good time tonight can i call you again
3590422 i have a friend over there let me introduce you to him
3590423 it will look like you and the girls are being

3590428 rap music was a government ploy to convince black people to kill each other and keep them in the ghetto
3590429 i just tried uploading an image and the image uploaded just fine
3590430 its uncommon to see people dressed up like this so the victims were watching them
3590431 then the perpetrator came up and said what are you staring at
3590432 its uncommon to see people dressed up like this so the victims were watching them
3590433 then the perpetrator came up and said what are you staring at
3590434 oh this is so sweet oh this is so cute
3590435 theres still a feeling the wages numbers are not sufficient to stop to the reserve bank from easing rates thats why weve seen a new probable low in the australian dollar
3590436 we have a double whammy today with both heavyweight sectors under pressure
3590437 we had commodity prices down overnight so the resources sector has been hit very hard and the financials are also down
3590438 see no similarities at all evolution has been disproved rest easy
3590439 if darwinism is correct and if were all just accidents and if were all just haphazard descendants of a mud puddle then hitler was right and hitler was totally right you can kill six million jews it has no moral significance at all any more than wiping mud off your shoe would have
3590440 ich hoffe dass diese vereinbarung den opfern und ihren familien helfen wird die wunden zu heilen und nach vorne zu schauen
3590441 dort gibt es auch mit meinem neuen schie anzug kein problem
3590442 wir wissen dass der erste wettkampf in die hose gegangen ist aber wir sind weiter da um medaillen zu holen

3590444 were winning we cant leave now and it doesnt matter how long we stay if conditions are significantly improved
3590445 well do the right thing unless its the wrong thing
3590446 no compromise with terrorists american interests must always be aggressively defended by force
3590447 why is it that every time i think i know the answers someone goes and changes the questions
3590448 peter please im an x man i dont shoot people im just trying to make a point
3590449 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3590450 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3590451 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3590452 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3590453 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3590454 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
3590455 it was a dream come true just to race here
3590456 was to reach over the table and punch the doctor who was giving me the news
3590457 if certain tests had come back elevated my parents would have stepped in
3590458 im the doctor im a time lord im 903 years old and im the man whos going to save your lives and all six billion people on the planet below you got a problem with that
3590459 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds im waiting
3590460 can you leave me alone im trying to get gas and this is really harassment please leave me alone
3590461 never mind the complete lack of historical perspective what ticks me off about his statement is that it perpetuates the urban myth that those of us pushing for equal marriage rights are somehow against marriages between heterosexuals
3590462 traditional christian marriage tm makes you special if teh gays can can get married then you are not special any more if the gay are like you then you are like them which means
3590463 henry ii of france married 14 year old catherine de medici because he fell in love with her it was a marriage of wealth to wealth combining the property of two of europes most powerful families and thus ensuring both of even more power and that was the norm for such families
3590464 the government of the gambia hereby announces the arrest in the gambia of na tchuto alleged leader of the coup plot foiled in guinea bissau
3590465 they said they had found the bodies and they were pretty sure who the bodies were
3590466 but unfortunately at the time the dna tests that were available they had to have someone from the female line available but there was no female line so they couldnt do it
3590467 since then theyve developed a new test that works on the male line and that worked
3590468 ive been involved in family history for years so i had that much information on him i felt as if i knew him sort of thing
3590469 as to what sort of person he was i dont really know
3590470 ive got letters here from some of his mates who wrote to the red cross about his death
3590471 his mother had got them to search for him because the army couldnt tell much about him at all
3590472 theres more evidence in this section of a very confused reading of lomas youre so fundamentally ignorant im surprised you can even use a the good the bad and the crazy the texas gop platform part i
3590473 tax haven subsidiaries are designed to duck taxes and some tax havens have a history of delaying or impeding u s tax enforcement the question is how much tax dodging is going on this issue cries out for additional investigation
3590474 dorgan said he will offer legislation to eliminate any tax breaks that u s multinational firms get when they set up offshore subsidiaries for tax purposes levin is preparing to introduce legislation to combat abuses associated with both offshore tax havens and illegal tax shelters
3590475 large u s corporations today are paying an effective tax rate of 15 percent
3590476 too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and avoid paying their fair share in the united states
3590477 how can we make corporations want to pay taxes to the united states rather than to tax haven countries
3590478 at any rate if this means the yankees have indeed conceded then the bosox losing out in the wild card to them would have to go down as one of the most embarassing moments in the history of sports so theyd better not i can live with that
3590479 it will be a salary dump the indians wont be getting anything of value back good move on both sides
3590480 maybe i should play a bit more against them but our overall play was good we kept the ball speed up and had a good balance with our forwards
3590481 if we maintain what we did it will work for us
3590482 we did not give away too many and now have two days to recover and see what we can work on
3590483 i did not feel good that day because of the bruised hip but physical therapy has done a lot of good i am ready for more action
3590484 when you concede 15 goals in two matches its a tough battle to keep your morale up
3590485 we have to take in the good and work out the bad
3590486 we have played the two strongest teams in our pool so hopefully it should get easier now
3590487 you could fund an entire cyberwarfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread so you would be foolish not to
3590488 could this somehow be indirect russian action yes but considering russia is past playing nice and uses real bombs they could have attacked more strategic targets or eliminated the infrastructure kinetically
3590489 the attackers are using the same tools and the same attack commands that have been used by the rbn and in some cases the attacks are being launched from computers they are known to control
3590490 we are harnessing technology that enables us to be anywhere and be live from anywhere
3590491 technology is allowing us to pare down to that one person who can deliver the product
3590492 given how much more splintered the audience is and the different ways that you all are getting your news its hard to have the same infrastructure that we had 25 years ago
3590493 this is a parting gift from the bush administration to its timber friends
3590494 it flies in the face of the science that says we need to protect more habitat not less
3590495 after almost 20 years of relying on a static regulatory approach which has led to continual inaction and further decline of the owl it is clear we should be using active management to improve the health of our forests and the spotted owl
3590496 unfortunately this designation doubles down on a patently absurd approach
3590497 the recurring phrases of salome bind it together like a piece of music
3590498 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it

3590502 leading the effort to keep the usa safe and secure
3590503 i think hes done a terrible job in the war against terrorism he ignored it he ignored terrorism for months when maybe we could have done something to stop 9 11
3590504 we got together all the fbi experts all the cia experts
3590505 i take it as whatever is going to help the team
3590506 obviously as an offense we need to put more points on the board than we did last year but teams are going to blitz us theres always a tendency to blitz young quarterbacks
3590507 if we had been a different team last year with the ability to pass protect better i think he would have had 60 65 catches
3590508 but we kept him in so many times in pass protection to help protect with our tackles that he wasnt able to get out as much as wed like him to
3590509 im a lot better than last year in college you dont play against that type of talent every day here youre against guys like two time pro bowl defensive end derrick burgess all the time
3590510 i think zach is going to continue to improve and will play in this league for a long long time he does so many things that you dont even see
3590511 mary midgley argues that opponents of intelligent design are driving people to accept it
3590512 well i quite like the theory of evolution and its use of evidence but intelligent design is taller and easier to understand so ill go with that one
3590513 be really careful and very specific here and try to clarify these issues
3590514 i hope youre happy youve ruined the comic sans ms font for me pz
3590515 a giant once lived in that body but matt brady got lost because he looked for god too high up and too far away
3590516 as professor winston has said science becomes discredited by this kind of stuff
3590517 2 she is not some out of left field nobody but is a widely read and respected philosopher
3590518 for instance i absolutely accept that a physical analysis of atterbergs symphony no 2 in terms of vibrations and frequencies could be wholly accurate and complete in terms of physics but i do not feel this requires me to deny that the symphony in question can be viewed from another legitimate perspective and considered beautiful
3590519 you can believe in god and evolution as long as you keep the two in separate logic tight compartments belief in god depends on religious faith belief in evolution depends on empirical evidence
3590520 the somewhat self centered but really a pretty nice guy once you get to know him gene
3590521 i would even go as far as apostasy in suggesting that if one wants to defend science then it might be easier to show that it doesnt have to conflict with christianity
3590522 if you do it nicely you might help break the atheism evil myth as well
3590523 the basis for id seems to be a bad interpretation of the bible driven by people hoping that their dishonesty and persistence in such will give them the right to control the followers of the religion they claim to share it would seem that support of id rather than opposition to it would be the
3590524 i drew a rough circle near the maritime adventures civilian genre
3590525 we think that this area is heavy with detritus from an unknown genre possibly squid action adventure that failed to fully form a century ago
3590526 i think that haidt is incorrect to include conservative parameters under the umbrella of morality
3590527 can you believe in both god and evolution yes the two can be reconciled
3590528 but is evolution indicative of a disembodied intelligence called god no if you follow evolution to its natural conclusion no god
3590529 so science implies atheism to those who take god as a hypothesis about reality it does not imply atheism to those who see the question of whether god exists or not as a moral issue instead of a factual one morals based on what though on facts otherwise theism is nothing more than humanism imbued with poetry and metaphor
3590530 the middle ground s the area where people insist that believing in god isnt like believing in a science theory its like believing in beauty love and the value of kindness its about being open to wonder and possibility right so much for respecting the position of atheism then
3590531 insofar that haidts taking a descriptive approach based on anthropological and psychological data it seems to make a fair amount of sense
3590532 i mean to say that primarily conservative moral issues arent part of human morality is rather bizarre when you think about it and when one considers that the other parameters pillars whaever may well have been a big part of the standard model of morality one might say what would have been understood as corresponding to moral concerns for most human groups throughout most of cognitively modern human history it seems even odder unless of course the authoritarian in group purity bits really become important only after say the rise of agriculture or perhaps some other transition
3590533 the ideology dawkins is selling is the worship of competition it is projecting a thatcherite take on economics on to evolution its not an impartial scientific view its a political drama
3590534 for instance i absolutely accept that a physical analysis of atterbergs symphony no
3590535 it is absurd to talk as if religion consisted entirely of mindless anxiety bad cosmology and human sacrifice
3590536 many of the essential doctrines of christianity are impossible for a decent and educated person to subscribe to
3590537 and im a scientific atheist in that i consider the
3590538 but other than that were pretty much in agreement i think
3590539 i must say ive never been called a conservative good ole boy before
3590540 on the other hand id disagree with among other things probably including different moral systems being incommensurable the idea that liberal morality is comparatively impoverished as he puts it yes i understand that its a matter of relative importance not total neglect
3590541 i have now defined the gene in such a way that i cannot help being right
3590542 dawkins says that natural selection is the only source of evolution
3590543 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3590544 ive said it over and over that if the world read opec knows we are serious about responsibly using our own resouces the futures price of oil would drop and opec would open the spigot as far as they could open it to drop the price of oil to drop as far as they could because it would then be too expensive for some of these processes to work
3590545 maybe i should play a bit more against them but our overall play was good we kept the ball speed up and had a good balance with our forwards
3590546 if we maintain what we did it will work for us
3590547 we did not give away too many penalty corners and now have two days to recover and see what we can work on
3590548 i did not feel good that day because of the bruised hip but physical therapy has done a lot of good i am ready for more action
3590549 when you concede 15 goals in two matches its a tough battle to keep your morale up
3590550 we have to take in the good and work out the bad
3590551 we have played the two strongest teams in our pool so hopefully it should get easier now
3590552 i dont know what happened after the first set i just lost the match overall it was a good game but i just dont know what happened
3590553 just because we played well against the united states and spain does not mean that we can beat angola
3590554 we were able to play spain the way we did because they took us lightly we can never let ourselves fall into the mistake of taking angola lightly
3590555 chinese basketball is getting better in this game we all took advantage of our opportunities if we had just been a little bit luckier then we wouldnt have gone into the overtime
3590556 we have to reduce our mistakes if we could have just defended a little bit better at the very end then we wouldnt have gone into overtime but there were a lot of reasons why we lost
3590557 we started thinking too much and when you start thinking too much you start making mistakes
3590558 in the first half we took advantage of a lot of opportunities but in the second half we had far too many turnover the mistakes killed us this is why we lost
3590559 it depends on the rebel resistance how fast we can proceed with the rehabilitation phase
3590560 we have to clear the area and declare it safe first
3590561 a lot of the farm animals were stolen plants and farms destroyed
3590562 we call this a sea borne aircraft carrier system which will be based on the northern and pacific fleets
3590563 both sides believe that creating a global missile defence system including deploying such systems in certain regions of the world or plans for such co operation do not help support strategic balance and stability and harm international efforts to control arms and the non proliferation process
3590564 some dont like such strategic cooperation between our countries but we understand that this cooperation serves the interests of our people and we will strengthen it regardless of whether others like it or not
3590565 russian chinese relations are one of the most important factors of maintaining stability in modern conditions

3590567 in a statement yesterday the interior department declared that even if a federal action such as the permitting of a power plant would lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions the decision would not trigger a federal review because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears

3590573 china is facing increasing challenges in maintaining fast and stable economic growth amid growing international uncertainties and domestic economic difficulties
3590574 the size of the slowdown is unexpected the government may use a more active fiscal policy slowing gains by the yuan and encourage lending to small companies
3590575 over the past few years expectations for yuan appreciation have been based on economic growth and a huge trade surplus the fundamental situation facing chinas economy and trade has now changed and so will expectations for currency policy and exchange rates
3590576 if financial institutions of freddie mac and fannie maes calibre could get into such a bad situation then what does that mean for chinese financial institutions the only reason we havent seen similar problems here is because property prices have continued to rise rapidly
3590577 anyone can get a mortgage loan in china no matter who they are
3590578 fund company executives fund managers and other important staff should be very careful about their speeches and blog content which may cause market fluctuations
3590579 in a seven hour span friday detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick endured a surreal journey that found him pleading to get out of jail in the morning facing a pair of new felony charges shortly afterward standing glumly for an eerie video arraignment in the afternoon and finally arriving back at city hall wearing jeans a dress shirt and electronic tether
3590580 the mayor is simply less intimidating today with a tether around his ankle than he was in 2002 or 2003 when he was firing cops who disagreed with him
3590581 others were more explicit about how they thought the distraction should be brought to an end several area leaders made or renewed calls for kilpatrick to either resign or be removed from office some did so quietly while others made public statements
3590582 its going to be broadcast all around the world and its one more blow that the city of detroit should not have to take and for that matter it involves in a negative way the image of the entire region
3590583 if youre doing business in the city of detroit if you own assets in the city of detroit if your corporate headquarters or other buildings that you own and operate out of are operating in the city of detroit you have a voice you have a stake in what happens in this city and you ought to be using that voice to express your concerns about your stake in this city

3590585 moscow claims it is merely defending the rights of ethnic minorities in south ossetia and abkhazia which have been trying to break from georgia since the early 1990s but its ambitions go far beyond that prime minister vladimir putin appears determined to reimpose by force and intimidation as much of the old soviet sphere of influence as he can get away with
3590586 the united states and its european allies must tell mr putin in the clearest possible terms that such aggression will not be tolerated and that there will be no redivision of europe
3590587 are the flash points of the 21st centurys great game and the issue is who will gain control over the caspian basin the richest depository of strategic resources next to the middle east
3590588 georgia is to an extent the finland of today both morally and strategically
3590589 if georgia no longer has its sovereignty it means that the west is cut off from the caspian sea and central asia
3590590 the baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline is only a minor element in a much larger strategic equation an attempt sponsored largely by the united states but eagerly subscribed to by several of its new ex soviet allies to reduce every aspect of russian influence throughout the region whether it be economic political diplomatic or military

3590594 whether the heats or the final are in the morning and the afternoon does not matter to us in terms of performance
3590595 i think in this day any loyalty is very lacking in sport and i think that often money talks too loudly
3590596 i just think when it comes to issues like that there are certain traditions that need to be followed
3590597 i hate to lose getting third in the 200 four years ago when i lose in circumstances like that it motivates me even more in the past four years ive been able to make some pretty significant drops in the 200 especially underwater i was watching my kick outs and thats all i can ask for
3590598 ive been eating a lot of pasta and pizza a lot of carbs
3590599 ive been sleeping as much as i can i get two massages a day ice baths ive been able to physically recover very well

3590603 to mention any bands whom i liked or didnt would only single out my particular taste instead of drawing attention to the fact that the lineup was diverse massive in the fact that it had well established artists as well as solo projects and shoot offs from other bands
3590604 from what i heard it sold out clean at 32 000 hello did you hear me 32 000 in the states for a festival to do those numbers are insane and lends credit to the fact that the usa can and will turn out for their metal festival much like the european fans
3590605 the side stages worked well because both the small stage and second stage were side by side and the bands just kept playing one after the other
3590606 the weather was hot the crowd was rowdy and the day ended perfect with two of the most legendary artists
3590607 it is with great pleasure that we are now able to confirm the name of george storey and have notified his family of the final resting place of their brave relative killed during the battle of polygon wood in september 1917 so far from home
3590608 while very good research work produced a list of seven possible names for the men dna matching techniques were only able to confirm the identity of two of the five prior to the re burial ceremony with full military honours last year
3590609 it has been a long arduous process but now private storeys place of burial is known to his country and most importantly his family

3590624 senator mccain opened his remarks talking about his conversation with the georgian president talking about the crisis there saying that he believes that there is a true strategic imperative for the world to take notice and make sure that georgia is protected because of its oil pipeline one that does provide energy access across the caspian sea the black sea a very very important position for energy independence for the united states to make sure that those sorts of things are protected

3590626 our neighbor mafoot already a friend of shads challenged shad to a game on a sunday afternoon
3590627 after talking again with several neighbors he decided that this table would belong not to our family but to the entire neighborhood providing our neighbors would be willing to help build it word spread fast and by the time shad bought the wood and various other supplies several men had come by to help get the work started
3590628 a week later the table is almost done but more importantly god has opened up doors for new and deeper relationships with our neighbors everyone who walks by the house or sees us out and about asks how the table is coming most have shown a genuine appreciation for shads hard work on their behalf and we pray that in some small way this simple act of building a ping pong table reflects gods love to our friends

3590643 the question is whether he was too tall to be the person in that video that basically was the defense the physical evidence showed it was not him regardless of what he said
3590644 he got away with it a long time because technology hadnt caught up to him

3590668 brothers do not slander one another anyone who speaks against his brother or judges him speaks against the law and judges it when you judge the law you are not keeping it but sitting in judgment on it there is only one lawgiver and judge the one who is able to save and destroy but you who are you to judge your neighbor
3590669 the scrutiny we give other people should be for ourselves
3590670 for in the same way you judge others you will be judged and with the measure you use it will be measured to you why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brothers eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye how can you say to your brother let me take the speck out of your eye when all the time there is a plank in your own eye you hypocrite first take the plank out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers eye

3590786 i faced five or six years in prison possibly more i wouldnt see my son until he was eight or nine years old i would have missed the most important part of his life

3590826 im ready to head back to michigan this weekend ive had a lot of success at that track and i think we had a pretty solid run back in june i think that if we take what we had in june in regards to our set ups and improve upon those a little bit then we should have a car that can definitely contend for a top 10 finish on sunday were excited to have carfax on board and our teams goal this weekend is to give carfax a tremendous introduction to the sprint cup series i feel very confident about what our team has been able to develop upon as we return to tracks for the second time this season
3590827 this will be our second time around going to michigan this season and i feel really good about it for the first race this year at michigan we had a really good car but i feel that our 16 th place finish didnt show how strong of a car we had we are actually bringing that same car back this weekend and were fortunate enough to have carfax on our car this week i feel that were going to be even better this second time around at some of these tracks we ran well at earlier in the season

3590848 michigan is a multi groove race track which makes it fun because it allows everyone to move around and find the best line that makes it fun for the fans because they get to see a lot of side by side racing i have a pretty good qualifying record at michigan but havent had the results we deserved during the race we have a lot on the line this weekend with the 1 million on the line and we are racing all out for the win
3590849 this may be one of the biggest races of my life stanley tools is putting 1 million on the line for a win talk about incentive a win this weekend would mean a lot to a lot of people i get to meet some of the kids from the childrens miracle network hospital in lansing mich this week and then i am going to go out on sunday and do my best to deliver a big win for everyone involved im honored that stanley tools allows us to be a part of such a special program

3590854 the agreement would fall apart in the case japan violates the agreement and does not act as demanded under the agreement
3590855 racing at michigan this weekend should be a great time for our citifinancial team im thrilled to have citifinancial as our primary sponsor this weekend and im feeling very confident about our chances on sunday weve had some tough breaks the past few weeks but i really feel that our team is constantly growing and building upon what we learn about our cars at each race every week i have cars that i feel are incredibly strong in regards to drivability and handling and now we just need to ensure that we get the finishes we know this team deserves michigan is a track i really enjoy racing at and im confident our no 38 citifinancial ford will run up front this weekend
3590856 i feel that our team continues to get more competitive every week im really looking forward to having citifinancial on our car this weekend because ive worked with this sponsor before and i consider them one of the best sponsors i have ever worked with david gilliland and i are excited to have them aboard in june when we raced at michigan we got stuck in a bit of a pickle because our car was very competitive but we could not get the one break we were hunting for all day long we had a much better car than our finish showed so this weekend were looking to make our own luck

3590861 everyones excited to start heading back to these tracks for a second time because now patrick knows the lines and what the track does
3590862 you can go back and look from the beginning of the year we focused solely on qualifying now half way through the race patrick will start understanding the track better he can identify how the car is handling and in turn we can make the adjustments needed to the car from his feedback we were able to improve our finishes towards the end of the race in a number of the races weve been in and now were focusing on top 15 finishes
3590863 it appears the uc is attempting to secularize private religious schools
3590864 confirms that uc may apply the same admissions standards to all students and to all high schools without regard to their religious affiliations
3590865 any instance of gods guidance of history or any alternative to evolution
3590866 instructs that the bible is the unerring source for analysis of historical events
3590867 if scientific conclusions contradict the word of god the conclusions are wrong
3590868 we evaluate the courses to see whether they prepare these kids to come to college at uc
3590869 there was no evidence that these students were in fact denied the ability to come to the university
3590870 if it comes from certain publishers or from a religious perspective uc simply denies them
3590871 theres this thing called being so open minded your brains drop out

3590881 one of the things they already addressed is we have a need for meters longer than 60 minutes
3590882 theres a lot of hair services nail services where people cant get out in 60 minuets so they were getting tickets so they addressed that
3590883 they made half the meters in the island one 120 minuets

3590885 the nationwide series has been good to me this year it has also been a lot of fun the no 9 hellmanns team has been putting together really strong finishes looking ahead to michigan we want to add to that streak
3590886 this will be my third straight start in the nationwide series and i wont be back in the car until dover so im going to do my best to get a good run for the crew and my friends at hellmanns the good thing about michigan is that there are a lot of grooves to move around in despite how your car is handling you can find a groove to make it work in ive raced open wheel and sprint cup cars at mis but this will be the first time i have raced in the nationwide series on this track
3590887 men will fight for superstition as quickly as for the living truth even more so since superstition is intangible you cant get at it to refute it but truth is a point of view and so is changeable
3590888 having been a keen photographer for some time i held professional landscape photographers in awe bewildered by their outcomes
3590889 carry out every appropriate maneuver possible so that gilad returns home safe and sound
3590890 we have set a stance according to which we support the pa
3590891 the other side is getting stronger it is not a coincidence that we are holding a large scale intensive exercise here in the golan
3590892 un resolution 1701 has not succeeded in its mission there has been a very significant strengthening of hizbullah in recent years we are monitoring the possibility of a violation of a balance by the transfer of advanced weapons systems from the syrians to hizbullah
3590893 what needs to be done in the field of preparations is being done as for the rest i prefer to not always talk about this but if and when there will be a need to act
3590894 changing from the foundation up the idfs state of readiness and the ability of units to afterwards carry out missions in actual fighting if and when this is forced on them
3590895 until now the truce has been successful there were around 10 incidents of firing over the past six weeks but this must be compared to the hundreds of incidents in the past every passing week of calm allows us to become stronger
3590896 we view in russia an important element in the regional and global existence while we view georgia as a place with which we have friendly relations because of its experiences the state of israel should ensure that it does not intervene and that it does not abandon friends during their hour of need this is what we expected of our friends and this is what our friends expect of us and we all hope that matters there will be straighten out quickly and that a cease fire and talks are reached
3590897 i think what happened to omri is an unfortunate incident he understands
3590898 yeah but i keep forgetting to feed it and then it gets sad and i cant bear to look at it because i feel so guilty so ive been avoiding it for a while now
3590899 well they only started that application so youd feel you have to come and check your profile every day and then see more of their ads
3590900 cyberbullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
3590901 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
3590902 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
3590903 moreover the vehicle for the cyberbullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000
3590904 we highly value our relationship with ms knowles it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowles features or skin
3590905 people think im really confident but i do get self conscious like many women about stripping off in public
3590906 saya nggak boleh egois saya punya penggemar toh video klip saya beredar di mana mana dengan baju terbuka juga
3590907 but i dont know if its about what sort of system you play
3590908 given his current contract doesnt end until the end of 2009 contractual discussions are not the short term priority
3590909 i was in complete shock i hadnt thought about anything but having another baby with this donor it was just so surprising and bewildering
3590910 id love to give him a full sibling but i just couldnt do it its so unfortunate
3590911 in addition to being tall and well educated their motivations for donation are quite sincere they want to help childless couples they tended to sell out very fast
3590912 theres a huge demand and the fda is essentially saying to these patients they cant choose the characteristics of the children they want even though there is absolutely no scientific evidence on their side
3590913 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt and whose background you are beginning to wonder about she has brought real results and even his words today are in doubt invented for a campaign ultimately he cannot win against john mccain
3590914 must now in earnest show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3590915 does anyone believe it is possible to win the nomination without over these two months raising all these issues against him
3590916 a nice campaign that wins the states alone that can be won will that be enough or do serious issues have to raised about him
3590917 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3590918 we are never going to say anything about his background we have to show the value of ours when it comes to making decisions understanding the needs of most americans the invisible americans
3590919 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt
3590920 make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
3590921 credibility on capitol hill one member and staff at a time
3590922 the truth of the matter is this isnt exactly how we would have wished to come to this job
3590923 there have been a number of events that have occurred and collectively have made folks uneasy and understandably so our task in the near term and in the months ahead is to get after this stabilize our situation and recommit ourselves to those things that we know will produce the right outcomes
3590924 there is much less room for poor performance and certainly for misconduct
3590925 we will be active on this and be surgical if thats what is needed
3590926 i think it is safe to say that we see things perhaps a little bit differently
3590927 its all about what we do for the joint team
3590928 it doesnt mean were perfect and we certainly have work to do things to fix fences to mend those areas where others have found fault we are going to work with a vengeance and well tidy that up and the united states air force will remain the finest air force on the planet
3590929 for a time it seemed like it was a slam dunk if you were gay from mexico and filed for asylum in the united states
3590930 but theres been a turning point the gay rights movement has started to make progress in mexico and its a little harder to show
3590931 people think the homophobia is under control which is not true
3590932 were going to raise some money at the softball game for a very good cause but its kind of turned into another prelude to the dream tony stewarts annual dirt track charity event at eldora speedway
3590933 im also excited about another back to back national event
3590934 were getting down close to the countdown and reading every year seems to be important no matter how the seasons going

3590938 what an incredible end of the knoxville nationals we had
3590939 the knoxville nationals is the biggest race we have every year and to win for the third consecutive year is simply awesome
3590940 with knoxville behind us we can just turn our focus to being the best we can every night with the outlaws and try to win as many races as we can
3590941 it sad to say but im happy this week is over
3590942 the track was a little narrow and when the race went green to checkered we really never had many chances to pass guys
3590943 now weve got to put it behind us and head on down the road
3590944 they mentioned theyve still got a number of large projects theyre currently tendering for
3590945 the bottom line here is that there is a lot of uncertainty in the economic outlook nothing new from todays announcement if anything its achieved a really good level of profitability in 2008
3590946 we got the run that we were looking for it just ended a little shorter than we had hoped i had been looking forward to nashville its the biggest track that ive actually been able to race on we were confident that we had a 14th place truck until we got caught up in that incident
3590947 i got my first high speed hit out of the way it definitely got my heart beating
3590948 i think testing nashville in the sprint cup car was the biggest help running 200 laps i didnt have to learn the line when i went to race all that i had to do was adjust to driving in deeper and not using nearly as much brake
3590949 jon was here during the second practice and really helped me out when we were having trouble he gave me some advice that really seemed to make things better he told me to really think about what i needed and what may be causing the issue i did that and we were able to fix the issue for qualifying
3590950 im proud of my guys on this air force ford f 150 team they did a great job getting the truck ready for me this weekend
3590951 im really pumped coming back to motor mile this weekend based on how well we ran there on august 2nd we qualified 8th and figured out some issues on that and fixed them it really showed we were passing cars and we were really coming im looking forward to going back and seeing how it goes
3590952 it solidifies us as the place to go for the cool stuff
3590953 my grandmother slipped in the loo we took no time in getting her to the hospital and shes already tired of staying in bed
3590954 there are too many people who just try to deal with a fracture in an inadequate way after theyve had a fall they can develop chest infections bed sores urinary problems if they wait too long
3590955 when i was at the hospital i asked the doctor if id be ok to go dancing the next day he said yes and that made me feel a whole lot better
3590956 money is not everything he has done the country proud and he is being honoured from all quarters
3590957 we are thinking of bringing a proposal to give them job in higher grade services so far the sportspersons are given jobs in group c and group d categories
3590958 little yang peiyis failure to be selected was mainly because of her appearance because we were concerned with the interests of the nation
3590959 what does it mean to say you are worried about image seven year old girls are all little angels why say this its really ridiculous
3590960 this inspirational film is a must see for all who wish to understand the roots and repercussions of the 1947 partition of the indian sub continent
3590961 the only information we have is that three persons have been detained at jeddah but we have no confirmation on who they are
3590962 we are trying to verify their identity through our sources
3590963 as of now we have calories mentioned for our seven special sandwiches we are now in the process of mentioning the calories for other food items too
3590964 we have a restaurant where one can find calorie counted food
3590965 after we saw people opting for brown bread and other healthy food we realised that there should be a special pizza dedicated to health conscious people ten per cent of our revenue is from wheat pizza
3590966 a pothole is a pit and bad patches is a rough surface on a road that may include two three potholes when we said there are two potholes in an area people used to count small pits in a road and question the numbers
3590967 by replacing potholes with bad patches the authorities are trying to hide the real figures even a small hole on the road is a pothole and has to be counted because it is going to give people a bumpy ride
3590968 i am not satisfied with this technology if the administration feels the contractors are not doing the work properly they should ask the providers of the technology to do the work all we want is pothole free roads
3590969 i was not aware who bindra was and what he did it was only after people started calling me that i came to know that he is a shooter who won a gold medal for india
3590970 some one is deliberately targeting me two months back at around 1 30 am i got calls regarding a gang rape that didnt happen in my jurisdiction i can still understand that as it was a police case in bindras case im shocked
3590971 we are very pleased to have bobby hutchens join our team at dale earnhardt inc
3590972 bobby will make a strong addition to dale earnhardt inc he brings two decades worth of experience and a tremendous amount of knowledge to our race teams this is another piece of the puzzle that we feel will definitely further strengthen our organization
3590973 im very excited about becoming a part of dale earnhardt inc
3590974 hopefully in the next few weeks and months we can begin to chart a path that will see dale earnhardt inc win a lot of races and compete for championships

3590976 hopefully at the end of the day well all be very happy with what we are able to accomplish
3590977 the recurring phrases of salome bind it together like a piece of music
3590978 since there are a limited number of liquid asphalt suppliers and semgroup l p filed for bankruptcy protection on july 22 2008 as well as lion oil having refinery production problems in el dorado ar there is a very limited supply of neat and polymer asphalt in the market and suppliers are now allocating liquid asphalt supplies
3590979 while arkhola is attempting to locate additional sources of liquid asphalt so that it can continue to supply its customers arkhola is hereby providing notice that it is equitably adjusting the amount of all contracts and purchase orders
3590980 making the chase may be a long shot for us but im looking forward to the challenge even though you try to not focus on the points we know that we really cant afford to finish outside of the top five in the next four races and even then we probably need a win or two to get us in the top 12
3590981 id love to get another top five finish on sunday and get us back into the mix
3590982 one things for sure my dear children do not worry about cleaning mopping laundry dishes etc but they will say mom you didnt sit with me and talk or mom you dont play with me
3590983 we try to do one homeschool subject then a housework chore 5 10 min then a play break for a half hour or so then we repeat
3590984 i have matured through motherhood but i have also learned how to let my inner child come out there is a time to be the grown up and a time to be the playmate im still learning the all important task of how to balance that
3590985 is this a time to be the grown up should i put this away for now and be the playmate
3590986 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3590987 appear premature based on the facts and evidence that congressional investigators and the inspector general have uncovered so far
3590988 we must continue to pursue the truth and facts and hold any wrongdoers accountable
3590989 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3590990 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3590991 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed
3590992 people who were hired in an improper way didnt themselves do anything wrong
3590993 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3590994 revenue in the markets division which includes the reuters and thomson news operations as well as financial data and tools for investment banks and other financial firms rose 12 percent to 2 1 billion

3590996 the results were not great the market was pricing in half decent figures and thats what it got said manoj ladwa a derivatives trader at tradindex in london
3590997 thomson corp of canada bought london based reuters group plc in april this year for about 16 billion in cash and stock aiming to expand its market beyond north america
3590998 i understand why our company put ron in the car last week but it was still hard to not be in the race
3590999 rons a great road course racer and he proved that sunday finished 13 th his performance helped to move the team up to 30 th in owner points and thats important
3591000 im glad to be getting back in the car at michigan
3591001 its a track where i feel really comfortable its fast wide and smooth you can run a number of different lines around the place so that makes it fun for the drivers
3591002 the team established some momentum last week and i plan on keeping things going in the right direction for us im looking forward to proving that i can go out there and get the job done
3591003 winning rookie of the year was something that the team and i set as a goal at the beginning of the season
3591004 a good run on sunday would put us closer to it and it would definitely be a big motivator for us as the season progresses
3591005 the couple tied the knot in a simple low key ceremony in las vegas last week while holidaying in america peaches first met max 23 a harvard graduate in anthropology two years ago maxs band chester french played at the itv itunes festival where peaches was a co presenter of the show the acclaimed new boston band were signed by pharrell williams to his label star track a subsidiary of the giant interscope label
3591006 its just the same like the rest easy to game
3591007 to step up our efforts we have asked lawson to join us in australia and new zealand when we present to stakeholders including player groups the result of the taskforce visit
3591008 as a former australia test player a coach and someone who lives in pakistan he is in a unique position to give his perspective to those stakeholders
3591009 i dont want to comment on what is good and what is not good but i hope the icc addresses the players concerns adequately and not only convinces me but also players who have shown concerns over playing in pakistan

3591012 our focus of talking about the issues that impact alaska families most such as energy costs health tending and education appears to be taking hold
3591013 alaskans are looking for independent ethical leadership from someone who is familiar with the issues they deal with on a daily basis
3591014 it looks like the whole state is debased every the time you dont want to be thoughtful like louisiana or metropolis or chicago

3591026 two eld time i made a very earnest mistake a mistake that i am answerable for and no digit else in 2006 i told elizabeth about the mistake asked her for her forgiveness asked god for his forgiveness and we have kept this within our family since that time
3591027 you crapper do whatever you want youre invincible there will be no consequences
3591028 although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
3591029 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
3591030 she told me that shed felt a connection to me when wed first met that she could tell i was a very old soul

3591037 the reason for firing was that theyre changing formats which they didnt really
3591038 weve been there loyal with the company and they didnt change the music a lot
3591039 a company shouldnt be able to say a 36 year old fellow would do it better than the 52 year old fellow
3591040 ive fired several disc jockeys we are in a business of change many people on the radio station who have worked there 15 20 years dont fit there anymore they might not sound age wise proper theres ethics here but then theres reality

3591092 i am disappointed the federal government will not be assisting the many new hampshire families impacted by this severe weather and we will be asking that the decision not to include individual assistance be reviewed
3591093 the path of the july 24th tornado went directly through new durham epsom and pittsfield
3591094 and these towns certainly deserve assistance to help them with needed infrastructure repairs to get them back on their feet i will continue to work with local state and federal officials to make sure all communities hit by this devastating storm are able to get the help they need
3591095 to expand the disaster declaration to include strafford and merrimack counties and to provide individual assistance to struggling families in new hampshire
3591096 the damage from the july 24 storm has been exacerbated by two weeks of heavy rains that have resulted in numerous flash floods across new hampshire

3591098 energy bills account for about 14 percent of a low income familys gross income and for many it may account for 20 percent or more economists estimate that more than 80 percent of energy expenses leave low income communities and thus do not circulate and generate additional economic activity inside those communities
3591099 weatherization can greatly improve the health and safety of a household while reducing overall energy use thereby lowering heating costs and reliance on financial assistance due to funding limitations there is a higher need for weatherization assistance than can currently be met
3591100 the united states europe and all other concerned countries must stand united in condemning this aggression and seeking a peaceful resolution to this crisis we should continue to push for a united nations security council resolution calling for an immediate end to the violence
3591101 the united states and the international community must speak out strongly against this aggression and for peace and security
3591102 they came to arrest me but i had called the court
3591103 i guess there was another partner that signed for it
3591104 there was some stuff that was ordered that wasnt paid for at the time i had no idea what it was for it could have been for food it could have been for napkins stuff like that
3591105 he can say what he wants but we arrested him

3591109 rob flew extremely well and led the standings from day one
3591110 his aircraft is a high performance custom aircraft and so he gave them all of its advantage and he still stood out ahead due to his great flying abilities
3591111 without a doubt rob is a world champion and has exactly the kind of outlook and personality that one would want a champion to have
3591112 it wasnt necessarily a bad hamstring injury but anytime you have that kind of injury you have to be careful and cant come back too early and hurt yourself
3591113 obviously its crossed my mind montanez has had an amazing year and id definitely like to win a batting title im sure it would be pretty cool for him to win the triple crown especially after making the big leagues
3591114 now scott needs to get going and get himself another 100 at bats and finish the season the way he started
3591115 nobody can tell the future im just happy i got another chance to play baseball the blue jays gave me an opportunity to play again im grateful for that and im going to make the best of it
3591116 i was happy to hear we had a plan b in place
3591117 the 911 centers were always able to contact dispatch centers
3591118 but if someone needed an ambulance they couldnt call 911 with no dial tone
3591119 like verizon before them fairpoint has a responsibility to report major outages to us in a timely fashion during business hours or in a graver disruption the staff is notified after hours
3591120 we heard people had tried to reach us our phone system is linked to the belknap county nursing home but by morning everything seemed to be all right
3591121 we would obviously be concerned about phone service if this happens frequently or regularly but this is the first time its happened that im aware of frankly i attributed it to the significant thunder and lightning weve been plagued with lately
3591122 it was a tough demotion for all of us because mikes a professional we dont like to send a guy down whos doing a good job up there
3591123 guys have to realize it doesnt matter what level youre pitching at when youre in double a or triple a thats really the way it is guys can go right from here to the big leagues
3591124 i would say the 30 million and the 15 mills was what we needed
3591125 what we know having gone through this past year is the community simply cannot afford that kind of a levy
3591126 i dont know of any district that has gotten out of fiscal emergency that hasnt done two things pass levies and make cuts
3591127 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3591128 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3591129 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3591130 with global warming and a world thats running out of oil the last thing governments should do is add taxes on something that uses no oil and produces no carbon
3591131 a digital download is the greenest way to buy music movies and software since it requires no driving to the store no delivery vans and no plastics or packaging
3591132 the retail sale lease licensing or use of specified digital products transferred to or accessed by subscribers or consumers
3591133 sales of digital audio works music digital audiovisual works movies music videos tv shows and digital books
3591134 most of the proponents of the nexus legislation would concede that given this is an election year its unlikely the legislation will pass
3591135 golden state retailers would be at a competitive disadvantage to out of state companies
3591136 adopt a regulation subjecting digital property transfers to the sales and use tax law state and local revenues could increase by approximately 114 million annually
3591137 a series of related images which when shown in succession impart an impression of motion together with accompanying sounds if any
3591138 i suspect we will see the next 14 attempting to address it in the next legislative cycle
3591139 as these technologies meet there is this question of what is digital goods and what is software
3591140 to define where technology is today and how it should be taxed
3591141 provided that the non electronic version of that item was not exempt
3591142 the way our statute is currently we probably could tax them but we should probably have the legislature have the final say
3591143 the sale of digital music delivered electronically to customers for download on their computers constitutes the sale of intangible property and is not subject to sales or use tax
3591144 i dont know ive given birth to 6 kids without epidurals this really isnt all that painful then again it hurts enough that im here i dont know i have a fairly high tolerance to pain
3591145 well give you a shot of cortisone in your heel itll help with the pain
3591146 really a shot of cortisone in your heel will help
3591147 ummm a shot in my heel for real no thank you
3591148 you just finished telling me you had a high tolerance for pain but youre scared of a shot big baby
3591149 im not scared of shots honestly shots dont bother me shots in my arm my leg my butt heck i had to give myself shots in the abdomen twice a day every day throughout my pregnancy but my heel a shot in my heel theres no padding there that sounds more painful than the stupid plantar fasciitis no thank you
3591150 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3591151 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3591152 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3591153 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3591154 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3591155 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3591156 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3591157 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3591158 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3591159 people never ran over me the way she ran over me anyway
3591160 i really think it does have an impact and the friendship does stay as long as they have a positive experience

3591162 those media have definitely changed the face of assignments to some degree because students are able to communicate with each other and find out about each other very quickly
3591163 greater participation of chinese citizens in the political processes and denounce rampant official corruption and abuses of power
3591164 eyewitnesses said ji entered the police station at around 10 45 a m on august 11 at 12 15 p m he was escorted out of the building and put into a dark colored unmarked buick by several men who appeared to be plainclothes policemen

3591166 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3591167 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3591168 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3591169 i would have liked to medal but i got my first personal best of the meet and i think thats a good effort
3591170 i cant be upset with that and im just moving on to the next heat
3591171 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3591172 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3591173 we dont really want to give any info on how we use it as an investigative tool to help the bad guys
3591174 it is an investigative tool for us and it is a very new investigative tool
3591175 ive seen them in cases from new york city to small towns whoever can afford to get the equipment and plant it on a car
3591176 and of course its easy to do you can sneak up on a car and plant it at any time
3591177 but i dont think thats something detectives would be too happy to put out there like that
3591178 they do have different techniques they like to use on suspects but they dont really want people to know
3591179 who has a story about how they got here this morning
3591180 there was a lot more early stage talent and ideas than there were vehicles to get them going
3591181 we said theres really an opportunity to create a destination for cutting edge talent and ideas in this region
3591182 will the technology work and will the market emerge thats the quintessential question
3591183 is it going to work and is it going to matter
3591184 in the event that such a transaction would present itself
3591185 we have the necessary flexibility to do something strategic with either of these businesses today
3591186 it has become a huge part of our business over the last three months weve been inundated with emails and phone calls
3591187 theres about a 150 customer backlog on conversions i think well be doing at least three to four a day every day from september well into november

3591211 estamos trabajando con el primer ministro de georgia y con el gobierno as como con las instituciones financieras internacionales para desarrollar un paquete de apoyo econ mico que contribuya a la resistencia de la econom a georgiana y mantenga la estabilidad
3591212 no estamos contentos con la manera en que estados unidos se ha estado conduciendo esencialmente sosteniendo a el presidente georgiano mijail saakashvili en los ltimos a os
3591213 vamos a hablar francamente con ellos estados unidos y espero que saquemos algunas conclusiones
3591214 tras el conflicto no hay manera de que podamos proceder con este ejercicio conjunto en este momento
3591215 thats a very courageous thing those girls who came forward did
3591216 in crimes of that nature the victims are often reluctant to report it but im certainly glad they had the courage to come forth
3591217 the church has been very cooperative with us in our investigation
3591218 according to the church the salazars have been on and off with that church for several years
3591219 he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her
3591220 because of the media and those who can not stop talking gossip jesus said all men will give an account for every idle word that comes from their mouth
3591221 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
3591222 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
3591223 i came into roll call one night and there were eight officers waiting on cars
3591224 it used to be you could go to kmart or wal mart and there would be aisles and aisles of models

3591232 park wildlife biologists report there has been no bear activity reported at this location recently
3591233 the bear that was shot did not have an ear tag or tattoo indicating that it had not been previously captured
3591234 the wall street journal recently did an article on failing etfs which hinted my view about them which is
3591235 no a trader is someone who makes a living trading ie needs to make money everyday and hence makes many trades daily
3591236 i guess im nosy do you care to share one such portfolio
3591237 i was not sure i wanted to order it unless it covered the tax aspects although am still mulling it over
3591238 etfs avoid irksome capital gain distributions through the clever use of exchanges in kind trades of mutual fund shares for securities in the fund with arbitrageurs because these trades are not taxable events etfs are typically able to rebalance their portfolios without realizing capital gains in effect etf shareholders are taxed as if the etf is just another security they pay taxes on dividends distributed by the fund but they are only hit with capital gain taxes when they sell their etf shares
3591239 the big advantage of etfs is that the sale of securities inside the fund does not typically generate taxable capital gains for etf shareholders investors in traditional open end funds must pay taxes each year on any net capital gains generated by trades inside the fund
3591240 hey rick we think your low fee and very low touch service model is a disservice to investors we would like to ask you to increase the support you offer your clients

3591252 your new hospital will provide the highest level of care possible to the residents and visitors of this beautiful region and thats why we thought this name was an appropriate reflection of our commitment to high quality care
3591253 no community has risen to the challenge like the people and organizations in sevier county

3591265 my 5 year old son was supposed to start school today i took the day off so i could register him and take him in and then they canceled it its really unfair how can you explain that to a child
3591266 you cant explain budget problems to a child who has been looking forward to starting school all summer
3591267 the kids have practiced all summer long and we dont think its fair to them why cant they just let them play
3591268 the allegation is she wrote checks to people who were not employees of our school system
3591269 weve changed procedures where there is a lot of oversight a lot of checks and balances
3591270 i told her that with a budget as big as ours we needed a cpa
3591271 he looked at all the other forces but that didnt look like a challenge for him

3591364 weve tried to do the best we could to keep this balanced
3591365 cyberbullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
3591366 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
3591367 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
3591368 moreover the vehicle for the cyberbullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000
3591369 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3591370 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3591371 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3591372 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3591373 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3591374 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3591375 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3591376 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3591377 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3591378 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3591379 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3591380 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3591381 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3591382 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3591383 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3591384 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3591385 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3591386 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3591387 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3591388 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3591389 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3591390 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3591391 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3591392 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3591393 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3591394 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3591395 the key is to try is to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california
3591396 anybody who tells you they know when the housing market will bottom is delusional but anybody who denies there are some positives out there that could make the housing market bottom fairly soon is equally delusional
3591397 the key is to try is to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california
3591398 california is the linchpin and so if the region flattens that changes everything
3591399 the data came in much better than we were expecting and much better than the market was expecting
3591400 i think a lot of the increase has to do with foreclosure sales which are selling at a quicker pace and have a faster turnaround time
3591401 housing market data is certainly showing early signs of stabilization on the activity side and home price side
3591402 we are not at the end of tunnel yet but more indicators are starting to look as if we are at least getting closer to it

3591407 we were down at the shipyard market before but this is by far better we formed a co operative and the group that we had all worked together and we all wanted to start this
3591408 i think the market here can definitely hold its own
3591409 ive had comments that this market is as good as any in the maritimes
3591410 we remain committed to the goals of making our communities safer protecting our youth from a life of drugs and crime and showing compassion for those who fall victim to illicit drugs

3591416 i dont expect my children to be perfect little angels as long as the report cards keep saying yada yada doh 111 television words that made the leap from the screen to society
3591417 you look at a tv screen and you really dont have any depth of field

3591419 this really the state of the art of the state of the art
3591420 i wasnt able to read the eye chart out of the left eye at all
3591421 its made of an array of about a thousand lenses
3591422 and it takes the light and divides it into two pathways and then reconstructs the depth of field image we see

3591431 we will continue to argue for fuelwatch well wait and see what happens
3591432 i mean nick xenophon with due respect hasnt yet been sworn in as a senator hasnt yet sat there in the senate
3591433 there are unintended consequences it could kill independent operators in terms of wiping them out and it will consolidate the big oil players senator xenophon told abc radio today
3591434 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices
3591435 it was always going to be the case with fuelwatch and im particularly unsurprised about the comments from mr xenophon this morning
3591436 of course in the lead up to the vote in the senate we will be taking senator xenophon up on his offer of discussion and if theres anything he can propose that meets his concerns while meeting the fundamental policy aims of the government to get more transparency in the petrol market and get rid of what is effectively collusion in the market we will be happy to talk that through
3591437 youre dealing with the majors theyre big bureaucracies theyre slow
3591438 yes theyve got enormous power but a quick nimble independent can work around them

3591465 act works to mobilize parents professionals private and governmental regulators prosecutors juries and legislators to end the physical torture and emotional abuse that is attachment therapy
3591466 the imposition of boundary violations most often coercive restraint and verbal abuse on a child usually for hours at a time typically the child is put in a lap hold with the arms pinned down or alternatively an adult lies on top of a child lying prone on the floor
3591467 a growing underground movement for the treatment of children who pose disciplinary problems to their parents or caregivers
3591468 almost always involves extremely confrontational often hostile confrontation of a child by a therapist or parent sometimes both restraint of the child by more powerful adult s is considered an essential part of the confrontation
3591469 for our purposes we have identified several distinguishing characteristics any one of which qualifies a practice to be called attachment therapy
3591470 practices teaches or recommends restraint or other violations of interpersonal boundaries for an allegedly therapeutic purpose the things mentioned are often deliberately confrontational and intrusive
3591471 principally treats or is concerned with a condition of attachment disorder distinct from the dsm recognized diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder and assesses for that condition using unvalidated diagnostic tools or uses no tools at all for objective assessment
3591472 practices or recommends treatment based on a belief in the efficacy of any of the following re traumatization catharsis especially through expression of rage fear sadness or other negative emotion recapitulation re enactment re living or re doing of stages of development or re patterning of the brain
3591473 adheres to unvalidated notions about child development or attachment especially the so called attachment cycle aka bonding cycle need cycle rage cycle though reference may be made to the attachment theory pioneered by
3591474 claims that at practices are safe and efficacious when there is a near complete lack of scientific support
3591475 practices or teaches harsh parenting and respite methods based principally upon combinations of deprivation isolation or humiliation for the child
3591476 uncritically recommends materials such as websites books videos lectures and conference presentations which do any of the above
3591477 a large fringe element of pseudo scientific psychotherapists attachment therapists at have invented the dubious unrecognized diagnosis of attachment disorder ad and its cure ad is thought to be a childs inability to form a close loving relationship with his caregiver typically because of early childhood abuse or neglect many if not most undesirable behaviors seen in childhood supposedly stem from ad

3591483 tie blue ribbons all around his waist to let the ladies know that hes married
3591484 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3591485 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible
3591486 no doubt some people will claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3591487 but the issue is clear current regeneration policies are failing the very people they are supposed to be helping and there is no evidence that the trend will be reversed without radical changes internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic economy
3591488 for the last decade british politics has been dominated by ministers who represent poorer urban areas and the new labour government has invested heavily in urban regeneration
3591489 a future conservative administration more representative of suburbs and the south would most probably have a very different set of priorities
3591490 no government has done more to turn around decades of neglect and since 1997 cities like manchester liverpool and newcastle have benefited from thousands of new jobs lower crime rates and better living standards thanks to our sustained commitment to regeneration and investment in public services
3591491 its alarming that this think tank is labelling our great cities as beyond revival and arguing that we should target less effort on them when those areas that have received regeneration funding have shown the greatest improvements
3591492 i go without food i havent eaten anything today i might eat something tonight
3591493 its really difficult and it affects your wellbeing fighting cancer is hard enough without the terrible financial worry that comes with it
3591494 if you want to raise revenue dont raise revenue from people who are sick if you want to fund the health service the fairest way is through general taxation so scrapping charges is the simplest and fairest option
3591495 entitlement to free prescriptions in england is based on the principle that those who can afford to contribute should do so while those who are likely to have difficulty in paying should be protected
3591496 higher debts tend to be social not regional if the cost of living is low strangely the debt is quite high its counter intuitive but if its cheap you would buy more of it than if it is expensive and the students end up with higher debt
3591497 it is clear that many students are sleepwalking into financial crisis
3591498 as the credit crunch kicks in and with food and fuel costs set to rise even further we can expect more and more students to get into serious financial difficulty with many having to resort to taking out commercial loans or being bailed out by their parents

3591618 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its committment to georgias territorial integrity that committment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their committment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense committment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
3591619 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
3591620 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3591621 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3591622 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3591623 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3591624 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3591625 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3591626 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states

3591630 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3591631 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3591632 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3591633 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3591634 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3591635 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3591636 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3591637 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3591638 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3591639 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3591640 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3591641 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3591642 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3591643 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star

3591649 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3591650 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3591651 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3591652 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3591653 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3591654 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3591655 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks

3591665 the boeing tanker team met with dod officials to dis cuss our comments on the draft rfp and gain further clarity in how the requirements and eval uation criteria have changed since the initial competition we hope that it was just the beginning of a continuing dialogue as we move toward a final rfp that prescribes the right aircraft and gives appropriate weight to all of the capabilities that will be re quired for the evolving mission over the next several decades
3591666 we had a frank and open dialogue and are confident that the final amendment will clearly outline the requirements that are expected to be met and the evaluation criteria that will be used to select the most capable tanker for the war fighter at the best value for the american taxpayer

3591673 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3591674 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3591675 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3591676 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3591677 we acquired them for a pretty small amount of money and built them out

3591699 arctic ice has diminished but theres more ice in antarctica now truth is about 2 3rd of total north pole ice always melts by the end of the northern summer this summer it got down to about 1 4 of the winter amount it is much less alarming if you consider that the total between the 2 poles only represents about a 5 reduction from normal
3591700 this was such a road these were such gold splashed peaks
3591701 to elsie i think that we do not have a real good choice with either candidate but i fail to see how you think obama will help with our moral decline as he apparently is a strong supporter of abortion and gay rights
3591702 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3591703 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3591704 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat

3591708 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power

3591728 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit

3591738 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3591739 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3591740 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3591741 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3591742 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3591743 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3591744 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there

3591747 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3591748 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3591749 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3591750 im having a belvedere in your honour the mountains are fantastic fabulous colours in the high desert will say hi at pasquals for you
3591751 i know there is a little mini panic going on in the ranks of not a few democrats and the chattering classes but with o in hawaii the nation on vacation the tv full of the olympics phelps romping in the pool and georgia on my mind i just want to say hey its august chill
3591752 the unreal is the paris britney obama glam rock nonsense the latest example of which is
3591753 the more team mccain does this as much as it obviously gets their ya yas out the more they demean their candidate
3591754 this country faces immense issues and it is not a time for insipid parodies and you know what the american people understand it and they want more from the men who are asking for their vote to be president of the united states so the mccain frat boys can act out as much as they want
3591755 the unreal is thinking that obama has peaked in the high 40s in virtually all the polls but not understanding that it is mccain who may have peaked in the low 40s where he has been stuck in virtually all the polls
3591756 what is real is race the industrial states and commander in chief
3591757 this election brings us into new territory the country has never gone through this before
3591758 you ask americans where georgia is and they think it is somewhere near atlanta
3591759 so the handwringers are wailing that we are only slightly up in august but guess what we are up in august and we will still peak in late october

3591761 thanks for giving me an excuse to sip the belvedere love taos and santa fe chill baby
3591762 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3591763 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3591764 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3591765 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3591766 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3591767 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3591768 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3591769 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3591770 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3591771 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3591772 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3591773 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3591774 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3591775 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3591776 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3591777 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3591778 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3591779 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3591780 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3591781 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3591782 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3591783 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3591784 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3591785 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3591786 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3591787 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3591788 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3591789 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3591790 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3591791 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3591792 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3591793 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3591794 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3591795 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3591796 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3591797 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3591798 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3591799 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3591800 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3591801 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3591802 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3591803 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3591804 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3591805 so summer slaughter ended up being wild as fuck thanks for rocking out with us and making it our best u s tour ever we wont be coming back there this year so were gonna miss you guys weve been home for over a week now chilling out and getting ready to hit europe for the second time this year itll be our first time playing festivals over there and we cant wait to experience the chaos to all our friends back home well be playing our last three quebec shows of the year as soon as were back from europe at the end of the month hope to see you then
3591806 the songs so far have a very old school feel without lacking originality and represents a conscious search for what has been nightrage s little unique enclave in the quite crowded melodeath scene
3591807 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3591808 there has been a lot of talk in this trial about anti muslim sentiment and anti muslim feeling in the community justice bongiorno said
3591809 prejudice sympathy and such things have no part in a criminal trial
3591810 it is important that you determine the case on the evidence you have heard not on any other idea or comment you may have heard justice bongiorno said
3591811 it is important that you dont do any research of your own
3591812 those are all things that are important to us and things wed consider first and foremost for the property
3591813 west austin has evolved evolution is a natural part of any place
3591814 im afraid if we dont make some noise it could fall away from neglect and that would be a travesty
3591815 political parties of any credibility make their conventions open to the public
3591816 i anticipate there will be no records kept of the meeting either it sounds like a lot of horse hockey to me they chose an obscure location one that is difficult for people to get to during the working week their goal appears to be to discourage as many people from attending as possible
3591817 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3591818 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3591819 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3591820 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3591821 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3591822 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3591823 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3591824 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3591825 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3591826 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3591827 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
3591828 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3591829 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
3591830 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
3591831 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3591832 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3591833 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3591834 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3591835 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3591836 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3591837 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3591838 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3591839 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3591840 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3591841 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3591842 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3591843 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3591844 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3591845 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3591846 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3591847 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3591848 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3591849 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3591850 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3591851 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3591852 but the wii version will be the exact same experience except for the changes that we need to make for the controls and everything else
3591853 weekend parties might contain people of high society or people of no society i dont know which was more pleasant to appear at tea time in winter when the tea was set in the centre hall before the big fire or in summer when it was laid out with infinite details under a pavilion roof at the end of the broad terrace there was a table for tea a table for cakes a table for children a table for grown ups a table for more grown ups and generally a nomadic group coming and going somewhere in the neighbourhood of nancy herself
3591854 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3591855 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3591856 it looks like its going slow but theres a lot of torque generated which can make the gears go faster
3591857 on the low end 30 mph wind could generate about 500 watts
3591858 when he was growing up i was cleaning up his room and i remember finding this thing that looked like a bomb
3591859 i dont know how he learned but he knows how
3591860 he knows how to build everything hes always on the computer reading about how things work
3591861 he first got interested in physics and then when we went to louisiana he got interested in meteorology
3591862 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
3591863 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
3591864 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
3591865 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
3591866 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
3591867 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3591868 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3591869 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3591870 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3591871 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3591872 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3591873 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3591874 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3591875 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3591876 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3591877 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3591878 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
3591879 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
3591880 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
3591881 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
3591882 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
3591883 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
3591884 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
3591885 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
3591886 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
3591887 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
3591888 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
3591889 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
3591890 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
3591891 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
3591892 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that
3591893 this report makes clear that too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and avoid paying their fair share in the united states
3591894 the notion that there is a large pool of untaxed corporate profits is incorrect
3591895 ellos nos van a proporcionar estos almacenes frigor ficos y silos de muy r pida construcci n y con tecnolog a de punta en esa parte ellos son muy buenos

3591900 i hear you we all hear you and the world is going to hear you real soon
3591901 these bastards are going to pay or my name is w
3591902 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3591903 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3591904 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3591905 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3591906 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3591907 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3591908 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3591909 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3591910 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3591911 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3591912 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3591913 tracey draws us into the world of family and friendship with a few surprising twists along the way bravo

3591919 therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a sabbath day
3591920 these are matters which have to be sure the appearance of wisdom in self made religion and self abasement and severe treatment of the body but are of no value against fleshly indulgence
3591921 how do i celebrate the holiday of christmas as a christian
3591922 how do i celebrate march 20th or some other random non holiday date as a christian
3591923 well he has to try them and if he tries them hell like them and eat them

3591931 cellular and connective tissue breakdown resulting in fine lines wrinkles skin discoloration and loss of elasticity
3591932 typically when free radicals are in our blood they increase to let our body know we are fighting an infection furthermore these free radicals cause a reaction called lipid peroxidation breaking down natural fatty acids that protect our skin
3591933 the foremost defense mechanism against inducing the formation of free radicals is to avoid sun exposure and use a sunscreen containing titanium dioxide and zinc oxide
3591934 by improving the integrity of the skins immunity the body can be better protected from diseases while reducing the visible signs of aging
3591935 first one must renew and protect the skin topically then reduce stress by finding an activity that you find pleasure in and finally adequately feed the immune system which will boost your bodys ability to fight invaders a diet rich in immune boosting foods ca help to increase the number of white blood cells in your system as thee cells help ward off infection and disease
3591936 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3591937 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3591938 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
3591939 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3591940 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3591941 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
3591942 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
3591943 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
3591944 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
3591945 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
3591946 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
3591947 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
3591948 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
3591949 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
3591950 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
3591951 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
3591952 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
3591953 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
3591954 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
3591955 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak
3591956 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
3591957 if fred morton was not such a little and insecure man on the inside almost like a spoiled child then he would not have taken what was said to him so personally but would have evaluated what was said to him based on the truth of the matter and how his actions were impacting children but that would be something that a competent and secure leader would do
3591958 the problem segal argues is not usually bad people but a bad system that focuses on process at the expense of results school systems that accumulate layers of bureaucracy and rules became so clogged and opaque that they create the worst of two worlds crooks can bilk the system because the top cannot see what they are up to while those who care about children must break the rules to get their jobs done in fact school systems often punish those with good motivations and then allow criminals to get away
3591959 many of my peers and superiors are terrified of speaking out for fear that they will be targeted harassed and have fabricated accusations made against them which will lead to an illegal disciplinary action
3591960 we have more business booked now for this months pga fall expo than we almost have time to accommodate

3591974 no if you didnt know about this before now if you havent already memorized the songs if you are not thrilled with the knowledge that this exists if you dont even know his name you are not worthy
3591975 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3591976 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea

3591978 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3591979 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3591980 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3591981 garth has given me an unbelievable opportunity to coach in the nhl with the islanders
3591982 from my time coaching in providence ive seen firsthand the talented young players in this organization i look at the direction and the vision for this team and see a bright future
3591983 scott has been one of the top up and coming coaches in hockey and with good reason
3591984 through his work in the minor leagues and most recently with providence over the last eight years he has gained an impeccable reputation the entire islanders organization looks forward to working with scott
3591985 a meeting helps sometimes were supposed to be professionals and be able to put a game like yesterday behind us but sometimes its good to pull everyone together i took what jerry said about bringing up starters as something to fire us up
3591986 it hurts when they talk about bringing people in this is our bullpen we want to step up and do it
3591987 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3591988 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3591989 ill be able to walk in the next morning and get one no problem
3591990 extremely urgent problem with esx esxi 3 5 update 2

3591993 we dont really want to give any info on how we use it as an investigative tool to help the bad guys
3591994 it is an investigative tool for us and it is a very new investigative tool
3591995 ive seen them in cases from new york city to small towns whoever can afford to get the equipment and plant it on a car
3591996 and of course its easy to do you can sneak up on a car and plant it at any time
3591997 but i dont think thats something detectives would be too happy to put out there like that
3591998 they do have different techniques they like to use on suspects but they dont really want people to know
3591999 i believe that we need to create a special committee in the u s senate to exercise oversight over contracting abuses related to reconstruction and the wars in iraq and afghanistan
3592000 i still believe that we need to establish a bipartisan truman committee with subpoena power to exercise the oversight that these abuses demand
3592001 myers had his people call the campaign to demand that the video be removed from youtube for copyright violation
3592002 many factors are contributing to this we are now trying to manage that as for the olympic green yesterday they saw not many people inside
3592003 its the season for traveling and last year the hotel was full the olympics should have brought business to beijing but the reality is too far from the expectation
3592004 he did not die because he left a legacy of poetry behind him he is immortal in our hearts
3592005 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race

3592007 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3592008 i believe it was the holy koran which i keep with me in the truck that saved me from the bullets
3592009 in the summer months i would expect to be attacked once or twice a week
3592010 last week we were caught up in an attack on a convoy of fuel trucks on a road we are working on it looked like a war zone with five diesel tanks burst open by rocket propelled grenades and burning diesel flooding out over the road
3592011 the talibans new tactics of blowing bridges between kabul and kandahar forcing convoys to slow down and become softer targets is causing severe problems to companies trying to supply kandahar from kabul
3592012 stopping all non essential movement and offensive operations because of fuel shortages
3592013 hey guys want to go to the movie theater to see the dark knight
3592014 kids playing with their computers and white supremacists throwing some money around
3592015 you dont have a right to criticize them theyre a private entity and they can do what they want
3592016 dont criticize them they have the right to say that
3592017 it is great to see that there are many people now who dare to speak their mind and do not care if those who dont yet understand would choose to mock them
3592018 its ignorant to believe that the founding fathers intended for there to be a separation of church and state
3592019 but because we really do not have a solid definition of at what point a human being should gain a legal right to life
3592020 we know that the cognitive process of sentience or self awareness arises in the neo cortex portion of the human brain
3592021 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
3592022 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
3592023 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
3592024 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
3592025 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
3592026 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
3592027 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
3592028 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
3592029 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
3592030 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
3592031 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
3592032 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
3592033 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
3592034 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
3592035 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
3592036 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
3592037 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
3592038 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
3592039 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
3592040 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
3592041 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
3592042 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
3592043 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
3592044 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
3592045 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
3592046 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
3592047 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
3592048 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
3592049 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
3592050 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
3592051 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
3592052 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
3592053 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
3592054 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
3592055 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
3592056 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
3592057 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
3592058 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
3592059 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
3592060 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
3592061 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
3592062 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
3592063 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
3592064 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
3592065 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
3592066 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
3592067 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
3592068 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
3592069 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
3592070 peace is not working these militants are not interested in peace
3592071 all americans are our enemy now not just the american government
3592072 the horse smashed through the fence but the vet couldnt find a mark on him not even a small laceration
3592073 driver james austin also was not injured so youd have to say it was quite an amazing escape
3592074 we are seeing first hand that renewable and greentech investment interest is a strong long term trend that will around for years to come
3592075 one of the first online investor resources providing in depth information on renewable energy greentech and water sectors
3592076 everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again but whoever drinks of the water that i will give him will never be thirsty again the water that i will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life
3592077 that we may have life and have it to the full
3592078 we are therefore christs ambassadors as though god were making his appeal through us
3592079 all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me therefore go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you
3592080 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing
3592081 the international baseball federation has confirmed the test it was done outside the olympic period starting on july 27

3592100 you need to go to the bank for four consecutive days to be able to buy lunch at jameson hotel the lunch costs 400 billion but the bank limits customers to withdrawing 100 billion a day so if you want to have lunch you need to go for four days without having it so that you can go to the bank for four days to get 400 billion to buy lunch

3592110 what contemptible scoundrel has stolen the cork to my lunch
3592111 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
3592112 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
3592113 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
3592114 the situation could well have been as bad as this say five years ago we just didnt know but now we have a much better indication of the state of the worlds primates and the news is not good
3592115 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
3592116 i hope that this investigation makes steady progress and leads to the quick return of the victims to japan

3592120 in the last decade these factors have accounted for nearly 100 of californias population growth
3592121 if we want to start healing our environment weve got to slow population growth
3592122 with americas population growing at its current rate every time we make an environmental gain our population increases and the gains are erased reducing immigration is the key to slowing future population growth and recapturing the momentum in the battle to save californias natural treasures its time for california to lead the rest of the country on this issue
3592123 when hard choices must be made for the greater good
3592124 expedite the regulation of transparency in party political funding and to consider a sanctions mechanism
3592125 not only about corporate governance it is a practice that is subversive of economic transformation
3592126 what do you mean i cant walk up here dressed as i am
3592127 you cannot walk up this street wearing that t shirt with those words on it and carrying that picket sign
3592128 why are you letting that man walk on the side walk but not me
3592129 because i have already taken his id and he lives in the neighborhood
3592130 you can see the los angeles city councils own applicable codes conditions permit forms and procedures online at http bsspermits
3592131 t he closure when granted will be for the exclusion of vehicles only admission to an event may not be charged and the public at large may not be denied access to any portion of any street except in cases of emergency a 20 foot emergency lane shall be provided on all streets within the said closure at all times
3592132 officer the permit may say total or full closure but the permit is issued subject to the provisions of the municipal code and they are set forth on the permit application form itself a total or full closure only applies to vehicle traffic the law states that the public at large may not be denied access to any portion of any street except in cases of emergency just because farny and scientology says the words full closure on a piece of paper mean you can exclude whoever you wish it still doesnt mean that the l a p d can just ignore the law and engage in civil rights violations
3592133 we only do what we are told by them meaning scientology security and the permit says they can do it
3592134 but the permit does not permit you to violate the law by excluding me from walking up bronson street
3592135 even though the crazy scientologists are calling us out very five seconds for nothing dealing with anonymous is fun much more fun than dealing with other protestors like the world trade organization and anti war protests
3592136 with all these dozens of police officers police cars and police motor cycles here that old party van would be towed within five minutes if you wanted it gone

3592163 we are plagued the whole day long just because of such a dead girl
3592164 ive never had a cupcake prepared by the famous prissycook
3592165 lindsay and sam sat down with friends and ordered dinner when someone who looked like the chef or owner came up to them and asked if they would go to the kitchen
3592166 they were so nice they went back and put on aprons and chefs hats and everything but when the owner asked them to pose for photos they became furious
3592167 i was warned our meeting wouldnt take long but i thought that would mean 30 minutes
3592168 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and
3592169 unhappy men children of little lords and brief kings shall such as these lay hands on you and yet live
3592170 i see the ring son of barahir and i perceive that you are proud and deem yourself mighty but a fathers deeds even had his service been rendered to me avail not to win the daughter of thingol and melian see now i too desire a treasure that is withheld for rock and steel and the fires of morgoth keep the jewel that i would possess against all the powers of the elf kingdoms yet i hear you say that bonds such as these do not daunt you go your way therefore bring to me in your hand a silmaril from morgoths crown and then if she will l thien may set her hand in yours then you shall my jewel and though the fate of arda lie within the silmarils yet you shall hold me generous

3592483 this takes us back to the beginning of the last century when public artworks were censored back in britain at the beginning of modern sculpture
3592484 i feel its insulting to women to remove a vulva because of somebodys attitude
3592485 some of these so called civic leaders are a little immature themselves looking at the female creative power i guess its a very deep rooted ancient fear that men have women are able to reproduce

3592492 the muslims are doing everything in their power to encourage their alpha boys to be tough aggressive and ruthless
3592493 i think it is not helpful to apply darwinian language too widely conquest of nation by nation is too distant for darwinian explanations to be helpful
3592494 to explain the unknown by the known is a logical procedure to explain the known by the unknown is a form of theological lunacy
3592495 certainly i see the scientific view of the world as incompatible with religion but that is not what is interesting about it it is also incompatible with magic but that also is not worth stressing what is interesting about the scientific world view is that it is true inspiring remarkable and that it unites a whole lot of phenomena under a single heading
3592496 paranormal phenomena have a habit of going away whenever they are tested under rigorous conditions this is why the 740 000 reward of james randi offered to anyone who can demonstrate a paranormal effect under proper scientific controls is safe

3592503 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3592504 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3592505 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3592506 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3592507 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3592508 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3592509 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3592510 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3592511 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3592512 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3592513 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3592514 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3592515 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3592516 i always wanted to do a masters and it was nice to be able to do it in my home province
3592517 our first group of students is a very dynamic group very energetic with a lot of deep experience and knowledge
3592518 ive been looking at different masters programs for some time this one just seemed to have everything that i was looking for with courses and a leadership stream which im quite interested in
3592519 it allows you to continue working full time while studying and that was the clincher i guess
3592520 we got a little taste of the work load already over the internet and the reading is quite extensive
3592521 without the mba program here im not sure that would be possible
3592522 weve been able to place some people ourselves in terms of our own operations on the island
3592523 at this point we know of 16 that have found work out of the 36 and we expect that number to grow
3592524 the decision to close a mill is never an easy one

3592526 the light sticks had failed over the course of the swim and they were no longer bright enough for the crew to see me and i couldnt see the boat so that was incredibly dangerous
3592527 it was hard it was really hard because i was swimming fine i wasnt even in pain i hadnt even taken any tylenol since hour six it was really hard to get out of the water being able to see the p e i shore
3592528 i was seeing giant towers eight times the size of the confederation bridge coming out of the water i was seeing trees without leaves and up in the sky i was seeing giant grey sunflowers it was quite unnerving
3592529 the diabetes community benefits tremendously from something like this there were a lot of people who were very very excited about it and texting me during the swim this isnt something i could have done five years ago because we just didnt have the technology this is just celebrating what life with diabetes can be like
3592530 i always wanted to do this since i was a baby ive been swimming in these waters
3592531 there didnt seem to be any rhyme or reason for it
3592532 sometimes you can come to grips with it if someone is sick for a while you think hes in a better place but it was just too early in life he was 25 he would have been 26 on june 29 he was such a handsome guy he had everything ahead of him
3592533 what we do is wonderful and im excited to be an athlete and i have been fortunate to have been very successful

3592538 it is a political document it is an agreement of principles and i think we have full coincidence of principles
3592539 there are any number of opportunities for russia to reverse course and to demonstrate that it is trying to behave according to 21st century principles
3592540 but i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3592541 there is no way in good conscience that we could proceed with a joint naval exercise given the state of this crisis
3592542 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3592543 thats whats at stake when russia engages in behaviour that looks like its from another time

3592553 ello va a quitar rentabilidad al sector minero lo cual al final termina afectando tambi n al erario nacional porque evidentemente el impuesto a la renta ser menor el canon y las regal as ser n menores y el aporte voluntario tambi n
3592554 a diferencia del sector industrial las mineras no pueden trasladar el precio de los combustibles al consumidor porque manejan commodities que tienen precios internacionales entonces esto va a implicar un mayor costo de producci n en todas nuestras actividades
3592555 internamente tenemos que hacer todos los ajustes necesarios para revertir el incremento del costo de producci n mediante una mayor eficiencia y mayor productividad esa ser una labor interna de cada una de las empresas

3592560 its rather ironic that someone like jim leach a person who placed such a strong focus on campaign finance issues would be endorsing the first presidential candidate since watergate to skirt the public financing program in the general election despite obamas lofty speeches on change iowans know that real change comes from working across the aisle to get things done a single endorsement does not hide the fact that senator obama has no record of achievement beyond the confines of his party while john mccain has spent his career putting the country first ahead of personal and party interests senator obamas record is a lesson in partisanship

3592571 our guess is that the banks projections will show inflation moving back to target in the medium term but possibly with upside risks

3592584 muchos granadinos han llamado en estos d as al ayuntamiento para preguntar por qu hab a desaparecido de su ubicaci n y el lunes pude comprobar in situ que no s lo la bandera sino el m stil completo se hab a esfumado de la torre de la vela
3592585 sino por el valor sentimental que para miles de granadinos ha tenido siempre ese s mbolo en ese lugar y cuya retirada nos duele mucho
3592586 me tengo que creer lo que me ha dicho pero debo entender que se trata de una decisi n tomada directamente desde sevilla sin su consentimiento

3592667 we will continue to argue for fuelwatch well wait and see what happens
3592668 i mean nick xenophon with due respect hasnt yet been sworn in as a senator hasnt yet sat there in the senate
3592669 there are unintended consequences it could kill independent operators in terms of wiping them out and it will consolidate the big oil players senator xenophon told abc radio today
3592670 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices
3592671 it was always going to be the case with fuelwatch and im particularly unsurprised about the comments from mr xenophon this morning
3592672 of course in the lead up to the vote in the senate we will be taking senator xenophon up on his offer of discussion and if theres anything he can propose that meets his concerns while meeting the fundamental policy aims of the government to get more transparency in the petrol market and get rid of what is effectively collusion in the market we will be happy to talk that through
3592673 youre dealing with the majors theyre big bureaucracies theyre slow
3592674 yes theyve got enormous power but a quick nimble independent can work around them
3592675 it may lead to higher fuel prices it will reduce competition and it is a mistake to lock in petrol prices 24 hours beforehand

3592687 there has been a lot of talk in this trial about anti muslim sentiment and anti muslim feeling in the community justice bongiorno said
3592688 prejudice sympathy and such things have no part in a criminal trial
3592689 it is important that you determine the case on the evidence you have heard not on any other idea or comment you may have heard justice bongiorno said
3592690 it is important that you dont do any research of your own

3592692 we will continue to argue for fuelwatch well wait and see what happens
3592693 i mean nick xenophon with due respect hasnt yet been sworn in as a senator hasnt yet sat there in the senate
3592694 there are unintended consequences it could kill independent operators in terms of wiping them out and it will consolidate the big oil players senator xenophon told abc radio today
3592695 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices
3592696 it was always going to be the case with fuelwatch and im particularly unsurprised about the comments from mr xenophon this morning
3592697 of course in the lead up to the vote in the senate we will be taking senator xenophon up on his offer of discussion and if theres anything he can propose that meets his concerns while meeting the fundamental policy aims of the government to get more transparency in the petrol market and get rid of what is effectively collusion in the market we will be happy to talk that through
3592698 youre dealing with the majors theyre big bureaucracies theyre slow
3592699 yes theyve got enormous power but a quick nimble independent can work around them
3592700 it may lead to higher fuel prices it will reduce competition and it is a mistake to lock in petrol prices 24 hours beforehand

3592710 i feel its insulting to women to remove a vulva because of somebodys attitude
3592711 some of these so called civic leaders are a little immature themselves looking at the female creative power i guess its a very deep rooted ancient fear that men have women are able to reproduce
3592712 we have a double whammy today with both heavyweight sectors under pressure

3592735 pegarle 6 1 y 6 2 a hewitt aqu es muy dif cil debe de haber salido del partido con muy buenas sensaciones cada d a va a ir a m s y va a seguir creciendo
3592736 del partido de starace al de hewitt ha habido un salto cualitativo muy grande
3592737 me pregunto si debo continuar no tengo deseos de ganar
3592738 ha rebajado la carga de entrenamiento y hoy por ayer no ha podido ni subirse a las anillas
3592739 confiamos en que pueda competir le est tratando el fisio y hay que esperar a ver c mo se levanta ma ana

3592741 no soy la nica que piensa as pero los deportistas temen las consecuencias de pronunciarse p blicamente y por eso prefieren callarse yo no tengo problemas en decir lo que pienso
3592742 estamos en china porque esto es un negocio el coi deber a reconocerlo y estar atento a que no se pierda la magia ol mpica
3592743 el coi ha tirado semillas en un desierto y cree que van a crecer saben que no es cierto no van a dejar que los campesinos trabajen el campo
3592744 ahora en china hay dos mundos el de la fachada brillante con los mejores deportistas y el de verdad de la gente que vive aqu
3592745 dije y lo mantengo que no tengo nada en contra de los 1 300 millones de chinos s lo contra el mill n que se aprovecha de este sistema pol tico
3592746 discutieron sobre lo que pasar si gano una medalla les preocupa que pueda decir algo contra el sistema en la conferencia oficial
3592747 s lo soy una deportista un mu eco profesional que debe divertir al mundo siguiendo los consejos del coi debo portarme bien s lo que puedo y lo que no deber a hacer

3592750 ellos han perdido por veintitantos ante grecia a la que nosotros ganamos por 16 nosotros somos buenos ellos son malos pero esto nunca es verdad si no lo demuestras puede volver a pasar lo mismo que ante china si no respetamos a alemania y no jugamos al ciento por ciento al final hemos demostrado garra y agresividad pero no deber a ser necesario estar con la soga al cuello para ello
3592751 puede pasar lo mismo si no jugamos al ciento por ciento
3592752 china te puede ir ganando y si t no lo aceptas es cuando vienen los nervios no cont bamos con que jugara como lo ha hecho muy fuerte muy r pido con un gran tiro y unos porcentajes extraordinarios la pr xima vez que nos pase esto vamos a ver si hemos aprendido
3592753 simplemente les dije a los jugadores que hab a que jugar con tranquilidad porque lo que busc bamos era la clasificaci n para los cuartos de final no pueden pensar en c mo es posible que estemos perdiendo
3592754 adem s de la calidad que posee necesitaba recuperarse de las molestias que arrastraba en un tobillo para mejorar progresivamente
3592755 he podido hacer un buen partido jugar m s minutos y hacerlo con m s ritmo he podido responder bien ayudando al equipo cuando lo necesitaba y he estado bastante acertado
3592756 si puede jugar muchos minutos porque se va lento es demoledor cuando se acerca el final del partido si se ha jugado a un ritmo alto es otra cosa
3592757 es dif cil pero de cualquier forma la hora es igual para todos los alemanes por si no bastara con nowitzki jagla y femerling han ganado cent metros y calidad con la incorporaci n de kaman p vot

3592763 cuando lo haces junto a rivales de nivel unos empujan a otros hacia adelante
3592764 voy a hacer lo posible para irme fuera no porque en espa a no est bien sino porque me entreno solo cuando te entrenas junto a compa eros y rivales de nivel unos empujan a otros hacia adelante
3592765 es como irse a la nba si aschwin ha logrado meterse entre la lite mundial trabajando l y yo solos en una piscina de matar y los dem s no lo han logrado con ayuda oficial es que algo falla en la nataci n espa ola
3592766 hay que mostrar apoyo no s lo cuando se saca una medallita
3592767 all la gente es abierta y hay muy buen ambiente en estados unidos te dan mucha ca a y s lo sobreviven los que tienen mucho talento
3592768 en estos juegos ha demostrado ser el nico espa ol capaz de aguantar el tir n de la nataci n mundial
3592769 porque en espa a la nataci n est organizada de forma amateur y margina a los profesionales
3592770 ha mejorado pero no al mismo ritmo que los r cords del mundo y por tanto no es suficiente
3592771 hay mucho nivel son mis primeros juegos y con estas fieras
3592772 me he levantado a las seis de la ma ana y me he notado cansada
3592773 ahora tenemos la aut ntica dimensi n de los juegos te rodean los mejores del mundo y vivimos en unas condiciones que nos recuerdan los tiempos de la pensi n cuando so bamos con ser jugadores de lite cuartos chiquitos nada de lujo de dos en dos haci ndonos la cama
3592774 est bamos comiendo y le vimos llegar hacer cola para la comida y sentarse en su mesa hola soy kobe nos dijo nos habl en castellano busc a messi y charl un poco con l y aprovechamos para hacernos fotos

3592788 desde los juegos de atenas 2004 he hecho un avance muy significativo mi mayor evoluci n ha sido en el nado bajo el agua en los mundiales de melbourne estuve depurando mi patada de delf n ahora mi salida es perfecta he podido determinar exactamente el n mero de patadas que tengo que hacer para cubrir los metros necesarios antes de salir a la superficie a dar la primera brazada y todo ha encajado bien en la ecuaci n
3592789 la aparici n de la fatiga es inevitable en una carrera en la que tienes que hacer un trabajo anaer bico la cuesti n no es frenar la producci n de cido l ctico sino producirlo paulatinamente y seg n un patr n para eso se hacen los an lisis de sangre en la piscina despu s de cada competici n con los resultados se obtiene un patr n cada nadador tiene el suyo todas las brazadas y las patadas que se dan hasta la aparici n del lactato est n medidas con ese patr n coreografiamos las carreras y maximizamos el aprovechamiento de la energ a michael es capaz de retrasar la producci n de lactato porque tiene un fondo f sico impresionante una vez que entra en d ficit de ox geno tiene una capacidad muy grande para soportar la fatiga
3592790 yo juego con el joventut en la acb y lo har en la euroliga no pienso en la nba los juegos son para m un punto y aparte ahora la gente del resto del mundo me conocer m s
3592791 visto ahora mejor haberla fallado porque en la pr rroga hemos logrado ganar por 10 puntos y as el basket average es mejor para nosotros
3592792 no nos han salido las cosas en la defensa hemos perdido demasiados balones y algunos tiros f ciles se nos han salido de dentro nos ha podido la ansiedad por resolver durante el descanso nos hemos mirado y nos hemos dicho esto no puede ser hemos reaccionado y cuando le hemos necesitado ha salido a relucir el gran pau el partido nos servir para tocar con los pies el suelo
3592793 l es consciente de sus virtudes y las explota al m ximo
3592794 ricky sabe lo que hay que hacer y suele realizar muy buenas elecciones a m me sorprende menos que a otros que le est n descubriendo precisamente ahora se hace acreedor de la confianza que hemos depositado en l
3592795 la jugada no estaba preparada de forma espec fica para que concluyera as estaba pensado que penetrasen y que doblasen el bal n fuera pero no soy partidario de dar instrucciones concretas en ese momento el jugador que lleva el bal n puede romper o no la defensa y encontrar o no una situaci n clara de tiro
3592796 weve been losing too many games in the seventh inning and later
3592797 i came in and just didnt get the job done
3592798 were getting him checked out were very suspicious hes not right
3592799 hes not right i know that for a fact i dont know if hes hurt but hes not right
3592800 it was a good win because it was a total team effort we battled from the start it something that we havent done in a long time
3592801 i made a couple of mistakes but i was able to make the rest of my pitches
3592802 we got got at bats good pitching and key hits
3592803 the big thing was that i didnt let that first home run bother me
3592804 it was a good pitch that he hit if you let things like that get to you you never get yourself straight

3592842 i believe that the jews and every decent person who hates bigotry should go the whole nine yards and delete the entire movie by boycotting it for the whole message is odious and offensive
3592843 is there really a more serious charge against a people than that they killed god
3592844 i had no interest in seeing the film at least at first
3592845 but when everyone began complaining and debating on it i gained interest
3592846 the trouble is that all too often in human history churches and priesthoods have set themselves up to rule peoples lives in the name of some invisible god and theyre all invisible because they dont exist
3592847 while the movie was less offensive than the books it was still bait for promoting the book trilogy which was very much anti catholic
3592848 our goal was to discourage moviegoers from seeing the film and make the movie fail at the box office
3592849 we knew we met our goal when alvin amp the chipmunks brought in more money than the golden compass did

3592855 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3592856 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3592857 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3592858 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3592866 its one thing for the opposition to make their case with commercials persuading people to be against it prop 8 because they favor homosexual marriage and those kinds of things
3592867 but its another thing to be outright deceptive and this is the epitome of political deceptive practices that have no business in any campaign
3592868 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3592869 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3592870 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3592871 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3592883 it doesnt matter how strong you are you still need a little luck

3592929 in terms of some of the shelter issues i think you will see a city and a community that has invested significantly in housing those who need support
3592930 we have invested literally hundreds of millions of dollars which to be candid has nothing to do with the olympics and everything to do with trying to create healthy communities for all of us to live in
3592931 that commitment was for 3 200 new social housing units affordable social housing units and we wont see them

3592946 and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3592947 this piece is difficult to write because i have been a fan of this super talented and funny black man dating back to an evening in 1990 at the old cotton club when carolyn albritton asked me to be a judge at the best of open mike contest where bernie won in the comedy category
3592948 its very rare for rates to go down but we are seeing in major east coast midwest and west coast markets instances where costs per gross ratings point are going down
3592949 sponsors dont benefit when fans are tuning in to see how michael phelps won rather than if he wins they dont benefit when viewers are cursing the network and throwing imaginary fruit at the tv they dont benefit when the country develops a collective loathing for the network that lasts far longer than the two week games
3592950 we appealed on the grounds that mr blonsky has some health problems the appeal was successful and last night the court released him
3592951 you never really know why somebody wants to be around you or if they do genuinely like you
3592952 i wish everyone had a label on their forehead so you could automatically tell their intentions sometimes you just wish that no one wanted anything from you
3592953 although im not a marketing major i have a bit of a trusted reputation after 18 years self promoting
3592954 id like to inform you i had no say in this marketing campaign but if i did things would be different since it is obvious that this poster is boring odd
3592955 adrian saw her with shia and that was kind of it the crash their hanging out
3592956 it hurts its something no one should have to go through
3592957 anger is not an emotion i will allow myself to indulge in
3592958 their marriage has the full support of their family and friends peaches and max did not want unnecessary publicity but following growing media speculation have decided to set out the facts

3592963 a lot of you keep asking me why my profile says single and why i seem sad lately so before you read it in some dumb article or online let me be the first to say it we broke up about 2 weeks ago
3592964 the main consideration was the national interest the child on the screen should be flawless in image
3592965 she is working hard to get over her split from mutt life has to continue thats her motto she is a strong woman
3592966 theres still a lot of recovery to come but shes using the help of her friends and family on a scale of one to 10 she is
3592967 shes great shes also 22 years old i think people forget that
3592968 there wasnt a period in my life like serena went through where i was doing drugs and having sex with my best friends boyfriend
3592969 technology has changed so dramatically that we can change how we actually operate
3592970 a lot of what we were doing is if you will an old fashioned approach to newsgathering
3592971 what makes the difference is how were able to get out spread those journalists to more places and how quickly we can bring back original reporting to our viewers
3592972 the parties are separating on an amicable basis regretful that the association was unable to work
3592973 to seek business opportunities in the media and entertainment sector
3592974 more public and private investment is needed to speed up digitization
3592975 celebrating the academys 60th birthday will be an important part of this years emmy show but we wanted to do it in a way that tied several generations of televisions past to the present
3592976 the key is the stereo tools are available at any point in your pipeline perfectly integrated the more stereo is not another toolset to be learned but rather it is more integrated in the existing toolset than the more unencumbered the creative expression will be
3592977 we developed tools for use with maya in conjunction with autodesk
3592978 initially the way it worked is we had a requirement for stereo moviemaking tools such as a way to see 3 d while working in maya now they are incorporating that in their software there is a broader appeal as more people are producing 3 d movies
3592979 special olympics is launching an r word campaign to seek remove of the use of the word from mainstream language and popular culture
3592980 tropic thunder is an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3592981 we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3592982 we will try to keep as much of the original show as possible
3592983 the main character is a woman who is the daughter of a fugitive so she has an unique eye to how they run and hide
3592984 what im looking for is a way to upload customized poi data to the maxx pn3000
3592985 we have a double whammy today with both heavyweight sectors under pressure
3592986 we had commodity prices down overnight so the resources sector has been hit very hard and the financials are also down
3592987 i asked a friend to come back to our home in hampstead london with me after we arrived i heard footsteps and voices outside it was peter and the nurse
3592988 my friend and i ran upstairs and hid inside a large trunk and a vast suitcase in one of the bedrooms
3592989 peter and the nurse talked downstairs for what seemed like ages then i heard footsteps coming up the stairs peter said he thought her little black lacy pants with red flowers were saucy
3592990 then they went quiet and i imagine they were having sex instead of thinking about what peter was up to i concentrated on fleeing the house quickly
3592991 when i confronted him the next morning peter seemed impressed by my having caught him out
3592992 theyre not stupid and its not like were making an instruction manual telling them how to drink and do drugs or have sex were just laying out how it is
3592993 this isnt like batman film dark knight where heath ledger died while editing was in its infancy most of our editing is done
3592994 well go back and see if there is anything we can do better i want my movie to be a tribute to both of them
3592995 i was unhappy in my mid thirties and trying to make it in movies i thought its now or never
3592996 i left our home in new york and travelled nearly 3000 miles to los angeles to get a new life i remember sitting on the plane thinking what on earth is going to happen to me
3592997 it was fantastic to do that album not only live with that music that i love everyday but i just worked with such wonderful musicians who are so talented
3592998 i would love to do another album right now though id like to focus on developing something to direct
3592999 peaches and max drummey are delighted to announce their very happy marriage the couple tied the knot in a simple low key ceremony in las vegas last week
3593000 their marriage has the full support of their family and friends peaches and max did not want unnecessary publicity but following growing media speculation have decided to set out the facts no further comment from either will be forthcoming
3593001 they love each other very much and want everyone to know that the matter was completely blown out of proportion
3593002 i had that same incredible feeling reading this script that i had on capote and here again is an extremely dramatic story about how a torn and twisted life led williams to write such great successes
3593003 you know what i dont even believe half the things they say anymore theyve been writing bad stuff about me for a long time
3593004 i remember one time this lady came up to me and said im not gonna see your movie but my friend said it was good
3593005 and i was like ok why cant you see it again and she said oh i read that it wasnt very good and i said what about your friend and she was like yeah shes not that smart
3593006 we feel that the use of the word retard throughout the film 15 or more times is done without any regard for the dignity of people with intellectual disabilities
3593007 thats the great thing you know if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also any artists right to say and do whatever they want to do
3593008 everything was going great until three comics came out each playing a dead star one was playing heath ledger as the joker and he just kept listing prescription pills he had in his pocket another was playing estelle getty and the third was bernie macs ghost
3593009 she shields was so freaked out her eyes welled up and she actually bit her nails at one point when someone pretended to dump estelle gettys ashes on 30 rock actor jack mcbrayers head brooke got up and walked offstage she watched the rest of the show from behind a curtain backstage with a grimace
3593010 i dont hate chris but i dont understand why hes doing this everything he says is untrue
3593011 i said be careful because shes not very smart i said it may be best to write it and not send it he sent me a copy of it i was shocked by half the stuff in there i know his feelings were very badly hurt you know how people can equate money with love im really thrilled that chris is not a hypocrite he was having a hard time sucking up to her
3593012 i was sitting on the subway one time and i looked up and saw a picture of jerry and it was the eye bank ad and i thought nobody on this train knows how freaked out i am
3593013 he used to call me every friday when she went out jerry and i were friends and i always laughed at this person cancilla orbach but i stopped laughing when she started hurting my kids
3593014 i want to clear nikkis name all her father did was step into the fight to try and break it up
3593015 its amazing that this has been kept under wraps for so long considering youre up against the electronic media but it looks as if the film bosses have won a major battle in keeping cruise on camera a top secret this time
3593016 i think all supermodels now are losing out to celebrities its celebrities who are getting the cosmetics contracts
3593017 there wasnt a period in my life like serena went through where i was doing drugs and having sex with my best friends boyfriend i never went through that kind of crazy
3593018 ive kissed just three people in my life other than stuff that ive done for tv or movies
3593019 her chin was almost entirely cut off she had a huge gash in her arm that looked like a really deep wound that was bleeding profusely
3593020 i had no say in this marketing campaign but if i did things would be different since it is obvious that this poster is boring odd and has zero to do with the movie i performed in
3593021 the left side of my face seems to be melting off of my skull my left side looks like brittany spears sic vagina
3593022 its no secret that im more rugged facially due to a drunken visit by the teen acne fairy but according to this poster ive got perfect porcelain flesh i look like the f kin bathroom floor at caesars palace
3593023 alec baldwin is so f king funny in this movie is he on the poster
3593024 one poster stinking up the joint isnt the end of the world yet it sends the wrong message about our movie and i just wanted you to know that i feel the pain
3593025 before i was an actress when oasis were really hot in america i went to la to see them play
3593026 i had a crush on liam gallagher i got backstage and met him but i was so in awe of him i couldnt say anything he just looked at me as if i was dumb
3593027 just thinking about it now makes me break out in a cold sweat
3593028 he will be sorely missed there are not so many like him any more he was a very powerful character actor able to play villains and nice roles with ease
3593029 they are friends and keep in touch via e mail she and angie have a girl talk thing going
3593030 after seeing reports that shell land the lead role jolie asked patrick what she thought
3593031 we are pursuing our collections claim we are adamant that we get paid for the services rendered and we view this claim by the trump organisation as completely frivolous
3593032 im not his muse every single junket that weve done so far for vicky cristina barcelona we always get the muse thing and we always say no its not that way
3593033 woody and i both appreciate how wonderful it is to work with your friends and its fun and we always have a great time when we do it we entertain each other we understand each other and we poke each other
3593034 were both fine and shias fine as well his hand is healing well
3593035 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humour would come from
3593036 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3593037 when they were both about to leave they had a heated argument outside the restaurant they were doing a good amount of yelling
3593038 i do think they could have waited a bit if they want a worldwide hit i have them all up here pointing to her beehive
3593039 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds im waiting
3593040 ive lost one of my best buddies and it is not easy to reckon with
3593041 i know one can never put a question mark where god puts a period so i will not question the almightys decision to call him home we all know when that call comes we all will answer personally my buddy will be missed for many reasons by me he was family
3593042 he will be a part of my musical life each time i sing the song deja vu as this was a birthday gift to me from him
3593043 my family and i send sincere heartfelt condolences to his family for their enormous loss and we will hold them in continuous prayer
3593044 ive written one so people better go see it itll allow me to make the next one
3593045 i began to see the most clearly i was 31 or 32 and i quit smoking i was so emotional
3593046 i had been so unhappy and i realised that i had just been literally stuffing it back with those cigarettes in my mouth i felt like i woke up suddenly
3593047 there was a long steady cam shot where a young christian bale is coming into this american barracks
3593048 he walks through the whole barracks and gets to the end of the barracks and theres john malkovich and joe pantoliano and me its a six minute shot and then i screwed up my line
3593049 i said oh whoops sorry maybe we should cut steven spielberg is in another building watching on the monitors and i just hear silence then i hear him what happened
3593050 im like i just yelled cut because i screwed up and hes yelling no no you never cut i literally turned white and shrunk because my hero and idol steven spielberg is yelling at me
3593051 i learned you never yell cut as an actor the director yells cut for years i lived with this shame but weve laughed about it since because he remembers it too i was mortified
3593052 there are creepy crawlies in there and apparently they got real dangerous centipedes you think its gonna be a fun video game but real centipedes if they bite you its like getting shot with a bullet its that painful
3593053 you can try to control the jungle but no one could clear all the centipedes the nooks and crannies where they hide are impossible to find
3593054 on the very first day of shooting i was carrying the biggest gun and i had to be running shooting diving with the gun and i landed funny on the gun and i heard something pop
3593055 bruno bowden amp rufus cappadocia origami blindfolded and to music
3593056 bruno bowden was part of the team at keyhole the company that built earthviewer a groundbreaking and addictive piece of software that lets you fly smoothly over an image of the globe assembled from satellite photos and then zoom in on your own house when google bought keyhole bowden helped turn the software into the indispensable google earth recently hes moved over to the google gadgets side helping to build more gotta have it technology he is also an enthusiastic student of the new origami
3593057 rufus cappadocia uses his cello to play the music he hears around the world filtered through the music in his head
3593058 the ghost is not a weapon its a way of life
3593059 you may just be a janitor and i may be merely the daughter of a woman who owns a failing music store but we are the two most beautiful people in this movie so come on
3593060 i know you want all the things i can offer
3593061 your band will play and well all scream your name
3593062 youll have cash youll have fame and youll even have me
3593063 the thing that hath been it is that which shall be
3593064 and that which is done is that which shall be done
3593065 i love to watch the dancing the girls love looking at the dresses
3593066 its been a long day trying to get everything organized
3593067 weve got two good quarterbacks both of them do things well
3593068 we had to get some top level competition and new bern is one of the places you can find that
3593069 i thought we held together pretty well at the end
3593070 avoid using null on string based fields such as charfield and
3593071 she was iffy about it she didnt want to do it
3593072 i have just reached technical support and it is a one man show located in someones home
3593073 huh ill have to check into that and call you back
3593074 i wish i could swim so i could go to the olympics
3593075 but what if i got to the olympics and finished last like that guy oh boy katie hoff is swimming i bet we are gonna get second place
3593076 theyve been on the team a number of years and theyre real supportive
3593077 theyve been doing a lot of playing in the offseason a lot of practicing were getting a lot of senior leadership from them
3593078 kara has played no 1 for us for all of the years she has been in high school so shes got a lot of experience
3593079 i think what makes it difficult is that weve got these matches scheduled and this is even before school starts
3593080 so it requires a whole lot of dedication from these girls to come to practice and play these matches during the summer when they could be vacationing
3593081 to commit themselves and give up some of their summer to play tennis says a lot for high school kids
3593082 what youre actually getting is the scrap value the meltdown value its not the retail value
3593083 a nightmare is much more intense than a bad dream it can arouse feelings of fear horror and distress it replicates our deepest fears and can reflect the different types of stresses we face in our waking world
3593084 nightmarish thoughts such as losing your job being homeless falling and being chased are a manifestation of how much the credit crunch is affecting our daily lives and causing distressed sleep patterns
3593085 for example dreaming about being chased or falling is a reaction to the stresses we face in life the attacker or falling in the dream represents the emotion of fear and anxiety
3593086 its no wonder gordon brown and alistair darling are making a special appearance in our nightmares at the moment both symbolise the fears we are facing in todays economy
3593087 we conservatives believe that you dismissed our serious quest for responsible limited government
3593088 as a senator i understand that you have had to adopt a compromising stance with the democrats to get legislation passed
3593089 but in your quest for the presidency we want to know if it is in you to become a passionate and forceful leader with a conservative agenda to fight the lure of socialistic programs promoted by senator barack obama
3593090 i am supporting john mccain because hes ready to lead america
3593091 john mccain should be ashamed of himself not just for voting against protecting an american company like harley davidson but then for going in front of a group of motorcyclists in sturgis and pretending to be one of them
3593092 combine that with the steadfastness of the t the traditionally conservative region encompassing central northeast and northwest pennsylvania and he will be the next president of the united states
3593093 if mccain is himself then he will earn peoples respect which leads to their support and their vote
3593094 i was hoping and praying to god that hillary would not only win the pennsylvania primary but also the nomination
3593095 mccain is honest and he seems like a good christian man
3593096 you take all those cars on that viaduct you drop them down on hilo hatties and guess what happens
3593097 you would expect the thing to be very congested and thats exactly what that analysis revealed and that congestion would back up into the viaduct as well
3593098 only about twenty twenty five percent of the traffic the residual traffic is coming off of the hot lanes at this point by pacific street
3593099 because when you use a toll way you manage the traffic so that it is always uncongested
3593100 its democrats its republicans its business people its labor its people who have been in politics for as long as ive lived here and people who are really newcomers to the game
3593101 so far hawaii has raised over 1 million for barack which is the largest amount that has ever been raised for a presidential candidate as far as i know
3593102 thats what happens when you put a guy in charge of the invitations so its aloha attire
3593103 thats it youre looking at it but as far as what the women are wearing it will be little but more dressed up than just aloha attire im expecting to see new dressed and people really dressed up for it so i think it will be really fun to see what everybody shows up in
3593104 im gonna wear my andy mohan shirt and my linen pants
3593105 some people pooled their money so they could get a ticket for somebody to go
3593106 i was particularly happy for willie k in particular because willie was there from the very beginning hes done events for us for free for the last year and a half
3593107 so its a terrific terrific lineup of hawaii performers and thats what we wanted we wanted this to be a hawaii event welcoming barack home to hawaii and i think weve achieved that
3593108 cyberbullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
3593109 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
3593110 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
3593111 moreover the vehicle for the cyberbullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000
3593112 it is every challenging but i think by and large the people of hawaii have been very respectful of his privacy of the time that he needs to kind of relax and sort of get it together before his very important convention next week in denver colorado
3593113 it was very exciting were so glad we picked here to eat
3593114 we just saw the 44th future 44th president of the united states
3593115 i was told but i was told to keep it secret of course
3593116 very approachable very relaxed hard to say a regular guy but thats what he comes off as
3593117 its a great thing to have a native son being so popular and everyone excited about it so were very proud and honored to serve him and his family
3593118 my life is kind of boring so nothing like this happens
3593119 the fact that he comes here at ala moana beach park is really is something
3593120 i think that its great that hes out and about to see the parks
3593121 i have to say he has a lot of appealing also for the europeans

3593140 the reds say they want to build a winner and are willing to put the money into the team then they trade away dunn for what a single a pitcher coming off tommy john surgery and two players to be named
3593141 they better take the money they would have had to pay dunn next season and get some established players from the coming free agent pool if they dont i can see a lot of people finding something else to do next summer instead of spending their hard earned money at great american ball park

3593148 no see people were getting thirsty a lot and the lines at the drinking fountains were getting too long so they decided to build this watering hole in the middle of the building

3593159 the progressive grassroots educational reform movement for small schools has been hijacked by business groups right wing ideologues and the ideology of the ownership society
3593160 traditional democratic values of deweyan progressivism combined with information age notions of professional community personalization and safe learning environments in an unsafe society
3593161 all out assault on teachers public schools and public space in general
3593162 in many districts around the country the best of the small and charter schools have indeed become agents of change responding to a national sense that the traditional system of public education needs transformation
3593163 its hard to say whether the worlds richest man has been part of the problem or part of the solution
3593164 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
3593165 i have huge respect for elliot and work well with him
3593166 facebook is a tremendous organization and i would not leave it if it were not for a great opportunity
3593167 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3593168 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3593169 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3593170 people clearly felt some relief about their finances emphasising just how sensitive family budgets have become to petrol prices
3593171 reflecting rate cut speculation lower petrol prices and a modestly firmer equity market recently some recovery in confidence was always likely
3593172 because of our continued investment in product innovation for consumers foxtels story is one of continued growth across all key metrics in the face of challenges to consumer confidence in the current economic environment
3593173 if youve got any heart drop them off they are like gold medals to us

3593175 i opened the door and he pushed me from behind

3593178 he could have taken them all so long as my mum was ok
3593179 obviously he has got a mother how would you like your mother being attacked that way
3593180 it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
3593181 when russia moved in on georgia john mccain stood up immediately and told them to get out
3593182 so he is really the man for the job at this critical time in world history
3593183 i respect senator obamas views and i believe that its important that we act in a bipartisan fashion now
3593184 not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent
3593185 i will take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3593186 its time to hear the roar of a strong american economy again and stop john mccain from shipping our jobs overseas
3593187 i believe they are the heartland of america and the judeo christian values they hold are the strength of america
3593188 and they are the reason that the people of georgia are looking to america
3593189 i already gave the brown bag to my cousin on her b day last saturday and lovesd it i love the purses by the way
3593190 when it was painted bright pink it was totally unacceptable
3593191 its not the councils job to deliberately offend people and by leaving it there we would deliberately offend people
3593192 this takes us back to the beginning of the last century when public artworks were censored back in britain at the beginning of modern sculpture
3593193 i feel its insulting to women to remove a vulva because of somebodys attitude
3593194 some of these so called civic leaders are a little immature themselves looking at the female creative power i guess its a very deep rooted ancient fear that men have women are able to reproduce
3593195 we never really took into account the fact that whether that d notice was around or not oops fuck it we made the film anyway
3593196 nasty illicit earnings and you know blackmail material and all kinds of stuff
3593197 i thought it was very interesting that you know its a story that had a huge cover up involved with the political scandal and the involvement of a certain royal princess
3593198 there was all this great juicy material that needed a story telling about it this wasnt so much a bank robbery and the climax being the bank robbery this was all about what happened after the bank robbery so i thought it had a really different sort of slant to the typical heist movie
3593199 no one likes just a selfish criminal doing bad things
3593200 i mean one of the charming parts about this little gang of robbers is that fact that theyve got into a safe deposit bowl without holding up a gun or hurting anybody theyre not violent types you know they robbed a bank violence free the motivating fact was to try and make a better life for him and his family so the motivation comes from a good source
3593201 its funny they brought him to set because roger donaldson director wanted him to meet me and he wanted to obviously let this chap see what we was doing and involve him as much as he wanted to be involved
3593202 my new budget for the next six months is 197 and it was 101 83 thats an increase of 93 percent
3593203 but then i thought about what the bills would be this winter and actually still havent made up my mind as to what is the best thing to do
3593204 every six months we will go through and make the adjustment
3593205 the projections are going to be horribly wrong one way or another over the next year and a half because we have had such a run up in prices

3593208 the reason people are interested in raw milk cheeses is because very often they are more full flavored given the fact that the natural bacteria in the milk hasnt been removed through pasteurization some say that those natural bacteria also have health benefits particularly for our immune system which is no doubt true
3593209 as a cheesemaker i prefer working with raw milk because it contains bacteria beneficial for cheesemaking
3593210 and i was interested in making cheese in the more traditional ways found in europe
3593211 a cow raised on grass has a healthy omega 6 to omega 3 ratio
3593212 their milk contains a newly discovered good fat called conjugated linoleic acid or cla
3593213 keep bossy on grass and her milk will have more beta carotene vitamin a and vitamin e as well
3593214 these extra vitamins show up in all her dairy products including milk butter cheese yogurt and ice cream this vitamin bonus comes in part from the fact that fresh pasture itself has more of these nutrients than grain or hay
3593215 i bought some of the emmenthal style cheese from kim and it was really good

3593221 priests at the london oratory have called for prayers of reparation
3593222 an evening of reparation with mass and adoration with prayers litanies and silent meditation
3593223 as a result of julys alleged theft and desecration of the eucharist priests at the london oratory are urging worshipers to be vigilant at mass and to receive communion on the tongue
3593224 whether on the tongue or in the hand ultimately real reverence comes from the heart external gestures alone cannot dictate a persons inner spiritual disposition in fact it is from the fullness of the heart hopefully with the holy spirit that our words and deeds ultimately speak
3593225 i baptize you in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit

3593304 compare that to our disappointment about indian affairs illegal meddling in our internal affairs and their violation of our constitutionally protected rights to customary governance
3593305 he should feel ashamed that he allows this behaviour of indian affairs to continue
3593306 well leave politicians and bureaucrats alone when the department of indian affairs treats our community fairly honours its agreements and stays out of our business
3593307 i hope that this investigation makes steady progress and leads to the quick return of the victims to japan
3593308 the agreement would fall apart in the case japan violates the agreement and does not act as demanded under the agreement

3593333 about 60 of our hires are from campuses those offers about 18 000 were made a year ago then we would see if we need more people as balance hiring this may include lateral recruitments

3593337 but i dont think it is likely at this time due to the economic conditions i guess its best i continue with this company for now and move only when the situation improves
3593338 as multiple job opportunities are witnessing a reduction we are seeing a decline in attrition in the banking sector
3593339 in a normal situation the fall in attrition rate would have been 2 3 not the huge 13
3593340 the companys attrition rate remains stable in line with industry averages which is at about 25

3593345 excellent letter and i agree 100 unfortunatley this happens all too often in both the corporate world and non profit world
3593346 trowbridges comments re lasar and atkins is disgusting especially coming from a gay man
3593347 the ccdc board is responsible for the malfeasance of its staff they work together almost daily the ccdc board is the development community and it is appointed by the local politicians who get their election money from the development community the organizing of this redevelopment organization is all done by design per the original ccdc business plan none of this is part of a hidden agenda its actually part of the open plan to drive redevelopment put the developers on the board and drive the redevelopment bus the issue facing nancy graham is real but its just one amongst every other redevelopment project downtown san diego every project gets amendments to the community plan gets preferred or greased in one way or the other the sins related and nancy graham face are nothing worse than what the most benign projects face
3593348 once again ian trowbridge hits the nail squarely on the head id go further and eliminate the cccdc and sedc they are just another layer of corruption and cronyism in a city buried in it please keep slinging that mud ian we know you sling based on facts and sling only at those who deserve it keep up the good work we depend on you
3593349 chris youve got it correct every part of the way keep it up
3593350 so why are these boards recklessly awarding executives thousands of taxpayer dollars as bonuses they have lost credibility in representing the public
3593351 i dont see the big deal about the relationship between atkins and lesar except if it means the process will not be fair and weighted in an unqualified persons favor
3593352 i think the mayor and all his developer friendly thugs are loving the fact theres so much of the publics attention focused on carolyn smith and nancy graham right now that they dont have to worry about the public finding out about the really big heists of city funds going on elsewhere within the corrupt mayors office
3593353 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3593354 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible
3593355 no doubt some people will claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3593356 but the issue is clear current regeneration policies are failing the very people they are supposed to be helping and there is no evidence that the trend will be reversed without radical changes internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic economy
3593357 for the last decade british politics has been dominated by ministers who represent poorer urban areas and the new
3593358 a future conservative administration more representative of suburbs and the south would most probably have a very different set of priorities
3593359 no government has done more to turn around decades of neglect and since 1997 cities like manchester liverpool and newcastle have benefited from thousands of new jobs lower crime rates and better living standards thanks to our sustained commitment to regeneration and investment in public services
3593360 its alarming that this think tank is labelling our great cities as beyond revival and arguing that we should target less effort on them when those areas that have received regeneration funding have shown the greatest improvements
3593361 higher debts tend to be social not regional if the cost of living is low strangely the debt is quite high its counter intuitive but if its cheap you would buy more of it than if it is expensive and the students end up with higher debt
3593362 it is clear that many students are sleepwalking into financial crisis
3593363 as the credit crunch kicks in and with food and fuel costs set to rise even further we can expect more and more students to get into serious financial difficulty with many having to resort to taking out commercial loans or being bailed out by their parents
3593364 even though i dont think theyve done that well with google news so far its not like theyre out of this
3593365 google should be working on ways to combine reputation but not just reputation of some editorial product reputation with popularity

3593409 obama allows reporters to recite whole gop claims and then refutes them which is overly gracious and gives full voice to the false claim yet one more time to a million viewers obama should interrupt reporters with a raised hand like a stop sign and start talking before the reporter completes that little recitative to make his up there on obamas high road theres no shortage of things to say in a courtroom one would object and then quickly think of some reason for the objection as you rise to your feet the point is the interruption of the opponents rhythm and speech before the message makes its impact on the jury the objection gets the attention of the jury and the original message is diluted even if the objection is overruled if a persistent reporter wants to hammer home a point its fair to say we really covered this pretty thoroughly last tuesday i believe clarification or what part of what i said last tuesday seems unclear to you it also lets a reporter know that this is not all about the reporter as media star

3593412 when we started to develop the all media concept for scorched there was little that had been done before in australia that combined such an extensive new media proposition with such a significant television offering as a prime time movie on australias leading network
3593413 we looked at overseas projects and were really making it up as we went along the knowledge we have gained about all media delivery through developing scorched now informs all of our future projects and firelight has become a leader in cross platform content creation

3593423 ive probably been the leading golfer in europe for close to six years
3593424 and i still get asked if i am the leading player in europe but it is six years i have maintained that
3593425 i didnt play well in the first two rounds so i had a discussion with my trainer back home and it was possible i was dehydrated
3593426 that gave me something to focus on in the last two rounds i focused on re hydrating myself whether that was the cause or not i dont know i might have just been tired but at least i had something tangible that i could pin it on
3593427 i had to convince myself not to get into this sentimental thinking that maybe it is his turn
3593428 maybe he deserves it i had to convince myself that it is going to be my day i deserve to win three majors you have to be very selfish in this situation when you are on the golf course

3593443 actually i think i ve made up my mind i prefer to stay in heaven
3593444 now it s time to spend a day in heaven
3593445 so you ve spent a day in hell and you ve spent a day in heaven now you must choose your eternity

3593500 theres a lot to learn from that example says catapia referring to dons vacation dont
3593501 its rather impulsive to go away together that soon it may be something we are tempted to do because it sounds like fun especially because everything seems fun in the infatuation stage but if we think longer about it before taking action we usually anticipate all the possible consequences in a more realistic manner and would decide to wait until we know each other better
3593502 you need to develop a bond over time that can withstand the stress of travel and work out some of the normal power struggles and figure out your decision making style as a couple
3593503 that comes from needing interpreters or one person speaking the language and the other not which can be hard enough on a relationship even with the glue of a strong bond from many years
3593504 ive heard many people say they hated that kind of trip or it broke up their relationship
3593505 most people have a better time if they discuss their preferences before leaving and find ways of taking turns doing their preferred activities together some of the time or finding a third option that they both would enjoy
3593506 no a mix of planned and unplanned time can keep it exciting and comfortable maybe a bit of both each day
3593507 there will always be fighting about directions at any stage
3593508 save the longer road trips for six months or later and learn how to fight fair youll need these skills anyways in any long term relationship

3593518 churn has been endemically high in this industry but its how the carriers work as they almost push customers to leaving rather than trying to keep them

3593529 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3593530 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3593531 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3593532 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3593533 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3593534 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3593535 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3593536 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3593537 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3593538 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3593539 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3593540 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3593541 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3593542 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3593543 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3593544 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3593545 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3593546 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3593547 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3593548 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3593549 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3593550 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3593551 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3593552 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3593553 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3593554 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3593555 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3593556 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3593557 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3593558 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3593559 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3593560 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3593561 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3593562 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3593563 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3593564 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3593565 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3593566 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3593567 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3593568 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3593569 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3593570 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3593571 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3593572 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3593573 the last couple of years its been a good league but one of the downfalls has been the limited number of games in the season
3593574 so it will be good to have a longer season and i guess that helps australian based players in regards to making the national team as well
3593575 if there are more games there are more chances of making the national team as well
3593576 obviously the league had to land on its feet first we all knew when it started that eight wasnt enough but the league had to establish itself and i think its well and truly grounded now
3593577 its ready for another couple of teams and hopefully they get it right
3593578 hopefully theyre financially viable and all very competitive on the field and if thats the case its great news for the league to get another two teams and make the season a bit longer and more aligned with the european amount of games
3593579 i do support expansion but its just one of those things that if they can only have one team and they make sure its a strong one team then thats great
3593580 because at the end of the day you want to have a product thats a good product
3593581 i think we are definitely in a position to bring one in whether thats the gold coast or wherever it may be i think over time well see the league expand
3593582 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3593583 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3593584 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3593585 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3593586 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3593587 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3593588 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3593589 who are open to doing something on the production side
3593590 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3593591 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3593592 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3593593 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3593594 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3593595 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3593596 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3593597 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3593598 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3593599 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3593600 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3593601 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3593602 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3593603 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3593604 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3593605 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3593606 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3593607 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3593608 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3593609 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3593610 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3593611 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3593612 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3593613 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3593614 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3593615 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3593616 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3593617 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3593618 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3593619 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3593620 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3593621 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3593622 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3593623 the fatality rate in 2007 was 88 1 percent and in the first semester of 2008 it was recorded at 84 2 percent
3593624 the decrease has not made us relax but at least it is a positive sign
3593625 these are former gang members who have turned their lives around and are on the street working with youths to curb violence
3593626 they just want be more visible to show that they are still around and will keep doing what they are doing and encourage other people to choose peace
3593627 oh god i do not want to see that phone bill
3593628 when he left for colorado autumn was really just a baby
3593629 in the best shape i can be in right now
3593630 i feel it every day and every night before i go to bed
3593631 hes not stronger than me hes not quicker than me hes not smarter than me im going to do whatever i want to do
3593632 u s flyweight raushee warren just lost yesterday by a point were not going to let that happen
3593633 were going to try not to leave it up to the judges were just going to go for it paul and myself have the attitude that were not happy just to be there were going to go for the whole thing thats the goal not just to represent our country thats great that is nice but we want to bring a gold medal back to providence
3593634 we waited for this for so long and hes there and i cant wait for this to end
3593635 its like a whole year preparing for all this and now its here and its crazy
3593636 it was back to how the party was some time ago the plan is to continue next year with a small party
3593637 i dont quite understand why i wasnt contacted when this was coming up in front of the selectmen
3593638 that being said working with the town through chief gendron was a good experience im very happy with how the town worked with me
3593639 i thought for sure if anybody got hurt it was going to be karl
3593640 but i think he just took as much as he could
3593641 i think i probably should go with the public defender to begin with is that possible
3593642 i know karl was very depressed over the whole situation
3593643 another round of notable thunderstorms is expected between 2 pm and 8 pm this afternoon with half inch or slightly larger hail gusty northwest winds to 45 mph lightning strikes and brief heavy rains that may produce a very short period of poor drainage flooding in a couple of localities
3593644 but there has clearly been an increase in the incidence of extreme precipitation of one inch of rain or more
3593645 and yes heavier precipitation is in indicator of climate change
3593646 i dont think any responsible climate scientist is saying this weather is caused definitely by climate change
3593647 first it was absurdly low and now its absurdly high
3593648 that guy looks like the first olympic athlete based on an image founders design
3593649 we need a new temple because the old one was very small and our community is growing
3593650 work is currently on with technological development making golden chariots has become easy even though it is costly some temples feel that having a golden chariot takes them a grade higher and improves the devotees view of the temple the government plays a facilitating role
3593651 ich konnte auf den letzten 100 metern nichts mehr sehen weil sich die brille mit wasser gef llt hat
3593652 ich wollte zwar unter 1 52 minuten bleiben aber unter diesen umst nden war es nicht schlecht
3593653 am ende des tages gewinnen sie keine medaillen aber sie geben mir die zuversicht dass ich auch unter druck mein eigenes rennen schwimmen kann
3593654 the entire angel flight world is saddened and surprised and shocked that this is happening all at once
3593655 is there any commonality its just so strange to have this happen after such a long history
3593656 the plane just did a nosedive straight down to the pavement
3593657 there was a lot of smoke thick black smoke everybody was pretty much horrified
3593658 the u s senate is one of our forefathers most brilliant democratic inventions
3593659 to preserve our vibrant democracy for future generations i believe it is critical to have a place where citizens can go to learn first hand about the senates important roles in our system of government
3593660 after a couple meetings i think well be able to pull that off by the end of the year
3593661 and thats not a credit to me thats a credit to his life people are so receptive to doing something in his name after hes done so much to help other people
3593662 this will be like a presidential library but even better in that it covers a longer era
3593663 and while presidents can do things by fiat senators do it by creating alliances and a team approach both scholars and our students will be able to learn about that process have access to the educational facilities there and the world class speakers who will be attracted there
3593664 i am disappointed the federal government will not be assisting the many new hampshire families impacted by this severe weather and we will be asking that the decision not to include individual assistance be reviewed
3593665 its a statistic that got away from us last year
3593666 we havent been a dominant defense in this league in a long time but weve got to get better
3593667 weve got to make sure we get our guys in the box not only the linemen and linebackers but also the free safety weve got to get a physical presence and be able to win games in the fourth quarter when people are trying to run us down and wear us down
3593668 a lot of times we were at the ball and we didnt make plays on the ball
3593669 the running back position the wide outs weve got a great offensive line we might expand a couple things but its not going to be a real noticeable difference were not going to go the wing option or something crazy
3593670 i feel more like a veteran on the team now than a rookie
3593671 i know the offense a lot better than i did the past couple years when i get out there im more confident in what im doing and the coaches have more confidence in me
3593672 he should be a starter on every special team for us
3593673 certainly he can make a lot of contributions in a lot of areas for us
3593674 you expect the unexpected when it comes to the business side of the game
3593675 as a player ive always said ill do what i can do and dont even get involved in it
3593676 hes a true competitor wherever he is hes going to be a benefit to that team hes a great teammate a great leader and i think hell do well
3593677 im trying to learn the system and get better every day
3593678 thatll be good cause a lot of things they do have applications to other teams well see during the course of the year in all three phases of the game
3593679 this is a real good opportunity for our football team going down there playing in a little warmer weather playing a good football team that has a lot of tough schemes to deal with will make for a good week for us
3593680 we will keep the best football players the ones that help our football team the most whoever they are if we would keep four quarterbacks i would think we could keep five running backs
3593681 sammys done everything weve asked him to do during camp
3593682 i did feel for a long period that there wasnt anything new to buy
3593683 but i really like the slim fit its not so roomy not so bulky and its a lot cleaner
3593684 this is a trend that you have to buy otherwise you look outdated
3593685 suddenly a pair of cargo pants and a polo shirt doesnt look good anymore
3593686 womens wear has painted themselves in a corner by offering too many options and with everything a trend it is very easy not to buy anything
3593687 if you are keeping up with fashion people notice and it gives them more confidence
3593688 i had looked in the mirror and never was impressed i looked like a little kid who was waiting to grow into his clothes
3593689 i feel extremely confident in the way i look everyone has noticed

3593975 its disappointing to lose somebody whos a good coach and a good person it happens in football clubs and its happened here maybe it happened too early but we wish him good luck in whatever he goes on and does
3593976 its different for him to coach here than it is in europe but i think he adapted really well hes taken the decision to move on because of family reasons and everyone knows family always comes first so good luck to him
3593977 believe it or not it was actually better toward the end
3593978 from ruuds standpoint i think its been difficult for him
3593979 so i understand his frustration with all that its not easy and not a lot of foreign coaches have done well here for that reason

3593985 that being said we havent been doing our jobs either when were on the field we need to sort it out and do what we can do regardless of who the coach is and thats what weve got to focus on
3593986 for a start we need to win on thursday to get confidence back up to get that unity back into the team
3593987 the only way we can do that is by having fun and winning games
3593988 when theres troubles in clubs it can have a good effect it can have a bad effect hopefully it will have a good effect on us where we come together as a team and we go out there and put in a performance

3594107 we have eight seniors and i would like to see a little better rhythm but on a good note both setters played very well
3594108 the next time you say bush lied people died think
3594109 we had several writers writing a lot of the political stuff
3594110 but yeah i had written a couple pretty big ones with will we actually wrote a sketch right after bush was elected where message from the president of the united states and it was dick cheney and he was telling everyone if you make less than 250 000 turn the channel right now because this doesnt apply to you and then he would say if you make less than 10 million turn the channel what im about to say doesnt apply to you until finally it was a billion dollars and he literally said put all your money in defense stocks were going to start a lot of wars oh my god were going to make a fortune off oil we wrote the most absurd things for him and will comes in as george bush and hes found a stray dog in the parking lot and hes asking cheney if he can keep him and then he leaves and cheney goes on to talk about how were going to rip this country off
3594111 and i looked at the sketch about a year ago and its all completely accurate
3594112 you know it was actually easier for me if i would have died in iraq my neuropsychologist has told me my left side of my brain has been injured severely so that is your ability to multi task to handle problems so what i do i watch game shows or look at crossword puzzles and even though im in school or at the va learning these processes i do it on my own to try to speed up my healing process im trying to enhance my own ability because im a father i have two kids i have to show them that hey even though daddys not himself you still have to work hard to achieve something

3594121 and if they think also that somehow its all going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3594122 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness then you count me out i think it will be an absolute disaster

3594138 entiendo el sentido de los obispos cuando vieron que econ micamente lo mejor era invertir con este grupo pero creo que ticamente ha sido el error m s grande que ha cometido la jerarqu a de la iglesia en los ltimos a os porque se han aliado con un grupo y unas personas que desde cualquier punto de vista social que se le juzgue han resultado nefastas para este pa s
3594139 es inconcebible que manejando millones en la conferencia episcopal puedan alegar desconocimiento que otras personas hicieron negocios y ellos no se hab an dado cuenta es una mentira que pocos se pueden tragar
3594140 los bienes de los cristianos seg n el evangelio son un instrumento para hacer caridad dios no quiere templos ni grandes edificios ni grandes fondos de inversi n solo quiere que las personas se quieran entre s y se traten como iguales
3594141 los fondos que recibe la comunidad cristiana para el uso comunitario deben de provenir nicamente de las limosnas de las contribuciones de sus fieles poner dinero a rentar para financiar sus actividades eclesi sticas es un pecado

3594239 cyberbullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
3594240 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
3594241 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
3594242 moreover the vehicle for the cyberbullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000

3594249 well continue to look at that to make sure that we have adequate liquidity to successfully implement this very significant kind of transformation
3594250 that is our intent but also i dont want to walk away from the fact that theres lots of variables hitting this business every day
3594251 our role is to make sure that were as flexible as we can be to kind of take those things coming at us both the good and the bad
3594252 what we really need to do is tell people that were back in the car business

3594259 we mostly looked at india we had a vendor we were considering and did some fact finding and we looked at north dakota but we concluded the best approach was to try and set this up in the city of pittsburgh it was a win win
3594260 who want to go to betty or susie up the hall
3594261 the truth of the matter is we are looking at our secretary lawyer ratios and looking to improve them and make them more competitive

3594269 thats not what we wanted to do we wanted to sell litter at comparable retail store prices and deliver it to customers for free
3594270 were the only one that we know of doing it in the country
3594271 we are slowly growing a business were prepared to lose money for a while
3594272 i used to do separate grocery store runs to buy litter

3594288 hes a young guy with a lot of energy and desire hes playing catch up and he has to catch up in a hurry this week im pleased with his approach but i need to see some results
3594289 for the purpose of gaining exclusive access to the lucrative replacement hip knee and joint industry and to the orthopedic industry in general

3594291 the defendants kickbacks and illegal payments prevented mccullough from competing in the replacement hip knee and joint industry in his territory and destroyed his business
3594292 for the purpose of inducing the physicians and institutions to buy its products and to not do business

3594304 you cant really hit willie parker and hines and ben roethlisberger and franchise players like that you have to be careful with them
3594305 we desire to be professional and practice with great professional etiquette we understand we fall short of perfection sometimes that happens this is a physical and emotional game played by those kind of people but it doesnt necessarily make him a thug
3594306 hes very sensitive to it and guys are sensitive to it
3594307 his actions were referred to as thuggery we take offense to that
3594308 these are young professional people who are very good at what they do who are very sensitive to how they are portrayed in the public light i was offended by that reference hes not a thug hes a young professional football player who happens to play very physical
3594309 i never mugged anybody or robbed anybody i got a clean record i dont know how i would be classified as a thug
3594310 everyone knows what i can do i dont think i have to prove anything i just have to go out and have a good solid game coming off this injury
3594311 greater participation of chinese citizens in the political processes and denounce rampant official corruption and abuses of power
3594312 eyewitnesses said ji entered the police station at around 10 45 a m on august 11 at 12 15 p m he was escorted out of the building and put into a dark colored unmarked buick by several men who appeared to be plainclothes policemen
3594313 petitioners have the right to apply we dont dare to touch them
3594314 its been a roller coaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident
3594315 i told him that all i had here for him was a dh if he did not want to accept that do not accept the trade
3594316 we will now investigate whether this can be regarded as a trend that was previously not recognised if this is the case it is out task to report this
3594317 in the same way we delete marriages involving fourteen year olds a man with two wives just cannot exist by law

3594320 as long as this period is effectively used to define the judicial statute of the muslims in italy
3594321 but also any alternative form of legalization of the mosques in this situation there is a risk to favour those who move in illegality while it would be enough at least to launch series of consultations with the only entity so far recognized by the state that is the great mosque of rome
3594322 there would be the danger to plan the initiative as a provocation against the islam which he himself after the conversion to catholicism considers violent
3594323 we set up the association muslim intellectuals exactly with the purpose to save the islamic community from the influence of fundamental authors such as al banna and sayyid qutb and to rediscover the principles of a mediterranean civilization in which to find again the roots of all religious traditions of the family of abraham
3594324 we have closed two other pipelines in georgia baku supsa and the south caucasus pipeline which is a gas pipeline
3594325 the oil pipeline was never a target that needed to be bombed
3594326 russians bombed the btc pipeline south of the city of rustavi
3594327 we dont know yet whether it was damaged its the second attempt to bomb this pipeline since august 10
3594328 it is clear that the europeans are launching a negative campaign against islam and the muslims despite their requests for inter religious dialogue and respect for the other person
3594329 expelling the italian ambassadors from arab countries and boycotting european products is the minimum that we can do to respond to this hostility
3594330 it is a very disrespectful way to treat the muslims by offending their feelings and disheartening them
3594331 every friday 3 000 muslims pray in milan without anyone putting in discussion their faith our city has never shown intolerance and i ask myself how many other cities in europe of dimensions similar to those of milan would give five locations for islamic prayer
3594332 for the time being it was decided to move the prayer in a place more in accordance with the muslim believers
3594333 i dont understand this reaction of the egyptian mps unless it is the result of a wrong information or an inadequate in depth discussion with the consulate authorities in milan and with those of the embassy in rome
3594334 have the legitimate and conventionally recognised right to have access to nuclear technology for civil and peaceful purposes
3594335 and within this framework comes the solidarity of algeria which recognises the legitimate right to nuclear power of all countries including iran
3594336 to make the middle east like latin america and africa an area with no nuclear armament
3594337 the peace and security of the middle east return to the game the vital issue with nuclear proliferation an issue that involves only one state israel
3594338 the latest coup in mauritania could never have succeeded without the agreement of america france and israel
3594339 for this reason we warn muslims to be wary of all forms of unbeliever democracy because they are just a ploy by the zionist crusader alliance to trick you
3594340 o people of mauritania you need to get back to islam and and dont hesitate to wage holy war jihad to fight the jews and the christians together with the apostate governments
3594341 we understand the american and israeli pressure on egypt but that does not justify the killing of people in such a manner
3594342 syria fulfilled its commitments and if iaea wants further clarifications we are ready to supply them
3594343 we have warned of the west bank government turning into a security regime and there are indications that we are heading in that direction
3594344 the saudi man is suspected to have been involved in burgling several shops and engaging in some other illegal activities
3594345 if the allegations against the imam are proved appropriate action would be taken
3594346 you could fund an entire cyberwarfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread so you would be foolish not to
3594347 he was believed to be among the top leadership of al qaeda
3594348 it is too late for the concerned government and musharraf to confess the consequences for the country would be too drastic especially from the americans who have been supporting musharraf through thick and thin
3594349 many youths carrying various types of dangerous weapons have started grouping themselves for further action over the issue before the police and hisbah men dispersed them
3594350 i recently went to visit a group of hiv positive women who live in the suburbs of kampala i found them in better conditions

3594359 all of us at alphameric are delighted with this judgment importantly it allows amrac to continue to develop and improve its business while we also believe that alphamerics leisure division which had been adversely impacted by this litigation can return to profitable growth and over time regain lost momentum
3594360 i think our bigger fear was that we didnt want to offend any religious people but looking at the discussion that unfolded from this thing what we had was a good sizable group of players that we might call militant atheists and the rest of the players seemed very tolerant including all of the religious players
3594361 we didnt want to go too far down that path we leave the whole creation of the universe question open obviously as the player youre coming in and playing something like a god directing the evolution of a species but we never really state who you the player are
3594362 when you put that much sound in the ocean theres a need to be careful in how you use it and where you go
3594363 it was a limited investigation based on a very specific set of facts
3594364 the use of reason allows for a legitimate diversity in our prudential judgments
3594365 these choices include elective abortion euthanasia physician assisted suicide the destruction of embryonic human beings in stem cell research human cloning and same sex marriage
3594366 such acts are judged to be intrinsically evil that is evil in and of themselves regardless of our motives or the circumstances they constitute an attack against innocent human life as well as marriage and family
3594367 in light of the above we would commit moral evil if we were to vote for a candidate who takes a permissive stand on those actions that are intrinsically evil when there is a morally acceptable alternative
3594368 so when there is no choice of a candidate that avoids supporting intrinsically evil actions especially elective abortion we should vote in such a way as to allow the least harm to innocent human life and dignity
3594369 we would not be acting immorally therefore if we were to vote for a candidate who is not totally acceptable in order to defeat one who poses an even greater threat to human life and dignity

3594403 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3594420 oh dont worry about him hes just an old pair of shoes
3594421 you know when youre out shopping and you find this fabulous pair of shoes the ones that make your legs look great but are actually comfortable and seem to go with everything in your closet well after a while they get scuffed and need to be resoled and you notice that they pinch your toes now so you give them away and maybe someone else sees them and thinks hey with a little polish those could be good looking shoes they try them on maybe even wear them for a little while but eventually they decide the shoes need more than just some polish to look good and they drop them off at goodwill well walker is that pair of shoes
3594422 i dont know why im even calling to tell you this but i dont want you to hear it from the kids or mom and dad
3594423 the wench line snapped at work today and took off part of my finger im having emergency surgery to fix it
3594424 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3594425 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3594426 when he gets ahead of the count and makes sure hes around the plate this is the type of game you see from him
3594427 i felt like ive been throwing the ball well the last few starts but a mistake here or there cost me
3594428 today i didnt have any mistakes i feel really strong and healthy and we have only two months left important months too
3594429 he found his changeup again which had kind of been gone for a little while
3594430 he had his normal slider and his slow curveball that he can throw with two strikes he pretty much had four pitches going all night
3594431 the main thing to me is how we play tomorrow
3594432 the last two series we face kansas city we do the same thing we win the first game and all of a sudden we lose the series i hope these guys remember that the way i do
3594433 other than the mistakes that he made for the home runs he pitched much better
3594434 theres not a ton of results right now but i think im getting closer to where i need to be to help this team win a lot more ballgames in the future
3594435 i think this teams built around home run hitters i just hope people are on base when we hit home runs
3594436 there were two balls that definitely should have been caught and we couldnt find the handle
3594437 thats a great deal and it makes sense for me to own one of those in the long term
3594438 i wanted to check the fat content of some food items it turns out that the standard tables i found are in a format that makes calculating the most relevant number of calories from fat about as difficult to calculate as possible that is the fat content is listed as grams per ounce you have to look up the number of grams in an ounce just to get started
3594439 when i say lets go to the doggy happy hour they get all excited and run to the door
3594440 my daughter loves dogs and here she can see all kinds of breeds
3594441 my dog trainer told me i should bring him for socialization purposes
3594442 these social outings help the dogs not be aggressive as for the owners it makes them feel theyre not the only crazy person who loves dogs
3594443 the other day four young men showed up with one dog
3594444 its just a nice opportunity for people to be able to sit down and relax and bring their dogs with them so they dont stay at home with their dog
3594445 people with pets generally get along very well with other people with pets
3594446 la reglamentaci n destinada a prohibir o admitir juegos o apuestas es de competencia de los gobiernos locales con m s precisi n de las legislaturas provinciales en cuanto son stas dentro del federalismo argentino las que tienen facultades para legislar jure propio en materia de polic a
3594447 la participaci n complementaria de la iniciativa privada en la actividad del juego se ha realizado en nuestra provincia en dos oportunidades en la gesti n de montiel a trav s de adjudicaciones directas entre gallos y medianoche y durante mi gesti n a trav s de licitaciones publicas permitiendo la libre competencia
3594448 creemos que una ley de la legislatura deber autorizar en cada caso concreto la incorporaci n del capital privado a las actividades de administraci n comercializaci n y explotaci n de los juegos que se realizar exclusivamente ligado a proyectos integrales de turismo
3594449 la concesi n de las actividades no deber abarcar los que ya est n desarrollados como los juegos de loter a quiniela quini 6 etc como tampoco los de pa o ruleta carteado dados etc que actualmente son explotados por el estado
3594450 im sorry mrs pickles we were unable to save your husband after he went into cardiac arrest unfortunately the croc shoes triggered a computer malfunction in the hospitals nerve centre which in turn switched off the program which told the machines to keep his heart going we done everything we can but the power of the crocs was just too strong

3594453 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3594454 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3594455 i thought of you when i saw this just a reminder that you are still in my heart

3594489 credibility on capitol hill one member and staff at a time
3594490 the truth of the matter is this isnt exactly how we would have wished to come to this job
3594491 there have been a number of events that have occurred and collectively have made folks uneasy and understandably so our task in the near term and in the months ahead is to get after this stabilize our situation and recommit ourselves to those things that we know will produce the right outcomes
3594492 there is much less room for poor performance and certainly for misconduct
3594493 we will be active on this and be surgical if thats what is needed
3594494 i think it is safe to say that we see things perhaps a little bit differently
3594495 its all about what we do for the joint team
3594496 it doesnt mean were perfect and we certainly have work to do things to fix fences to mend those areas where others have found fault we are going to work with a vengeance and well tidy that up and the united states air force will remain the finest air force on the planet

3594498 the problem from our perspective has not been an absence of information going into the pakistani government
3594499 they have struck like this many times we are trying to convince them to share information
3594500 then we can hit such targets ourselves otherwise its a violation and nobody in pakistan will like it
3594501 it wont cost much but we dont have the gadgets
3594502 nonmilitants who throw down their arms and come into the mainstream
3594503 when all these things dont work we have to have action
3594504 they thought of it as something they really enjoy and like to do but now they do it in order to get money and they think of the task as an instrument to get money and not an activity that has value in its own right
3594505 human beings both want to and in a deeper way need to feel a sense of being autonomous when someone else begins to seduce you into behaving with an offer of a reward it takes away your sense of being autonomous now you are doing it for someone else
3594506 a central tenet of economics is that individuals respond to incentives
3594507 for psychologists and sociologists in contrast rewards and punishments are often counterproductive because they undermine intrinsic motivation
3594508 if i pay my kids to do their homework i am saying you will get this if you do your homework but i am also saying homework is not likely to have intrinsic rewards
3594509 cyberbullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
3594510 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
3594511 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
3594512 moreover the vehicle for the cyberbullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000
3594513 this is a parting gift from the bush administration to its timber friends
3594514 it flies in the face of the science that says we need to protect more habitat not less
3594515 after almost 20 years of relying on a static regulatory approach which has led to continual inaction and further decline of the owl it is clear we should be using active management to improve the health of our forests and the spotted owl
3594516 unfortunately this designation doubles down on a patently absurd approach
3594517 we feel it is a reneg on the governors promise
3594518 he came into office pledging to put 1 000 police on the street this is going to take 1 000 police off the street we think that public safety will suffer in the long run
3594519 the governor was clearly elected on a mandate for change and this is real change this is the type of reform that the public have been clamoring for
3594520 if 49 other states can strike a balance between public safety and saving money we can too

3594587 ill be the freshest on the start line for sure and i think ill probably be one of the happiest to be there because there have been those points when i really didnt think i would make it
3594588 if it was a big city marathon or even a world championships id say do not push it make sure i was well prepared but i dont want to sit there watching it wondering what could have happened

3594680 the heart of a renegade is a skillfully crafted novel packed with complex characters involved in a well used plot line however it is innovatively done loreth anne whites pacing is superb maintaining ever mounting intensity as the story plays out this story is rich with detail and a plot that could be expanded to a 450 page hardcover that said it does not feel as if it were condensed but evolves in the expected manner only to twist and turn a bit adding interest and suspense the dynamics between jessica and luke are extraordinarily well handled white is a very gifted author and whose future novels will be sought out by this reviewer

3594693 we talk about vocation theologically as the practice through which people offer their lives in response to gods call amid a world in need this means that vocation is more than a job more than a career more than a religious office
3594694 vocation refers to theological ways of making sense of everyday actions and experiences framed in the light of a god who calls people to particular ways of being in the world soccer coaches sunday school teachers foster families even soldiers and war protesters all may be sorting through their actions in a world in relation to gods call this theological view of vocation speaks to both the private or inner discernment of individual gifts and also to the deeply public quest fostered within a community of others who also struggle to live lives of meaning in relation to gods call
3594695 we envision churches as communities of practice in which believers accompany one antoher in living out their baptismal callings callings that take them into pockets of brokenness and need in an at risk hurting world we invite readers of this book to imagine with us a church in which adults are companions of young people in their vocational journeys

3594707 as a religious man i ask for justice for the palestinians
3594708 defending human rights is a duty for christians and religious people
3594709 my wish is that the american people understand what the palestinians go through
3594710 i would like to see christians in the u s be more understanding and sympathetic with palestinians who have had 60 years of injustice and 60 years of being prevented from going back to their land
3594711 there are millions who are refugees but are prevented from going back to their land where they were born
3594712 i hope that one day you will visit us in jerusalem after its liberated from the occupation and the arab palestinian flag is there
3594713 a palestinian terrorist in jerusalem yesterday deliberately drove a bulldozer into several buses and cars killing three and injuring dozens of israeli civilians the palestinian archbishop essentially condoned that atrocity by his silence about it

3594720 because this is a prepaid card the customer pays no interest on their balance the difference with this card is that cordoba financial group does not earn any interest on the balance
3594721 normally when someone puts money on a prepaid card the company that issues the card will earn interest on the balance until the person spends it this is not the case with cordoba as you can neither earn nor pay interest under sharia law

3594740 third party candidates pulling close to 20 of total vote
3594741 i dont want to say there has been a conspiracy among the pollsters and major media to exclude any mention of the alternatives but until now it is a fact nonetheless
3594742 the american people rose up and said look in the united states its time for the immigrants to adapt to our ways not the other way around
3594743 e specially given that an immigrant to an islamic country had darn well better adopt islam and try to build a church in saudi arabia and see how far you get
3594744 but the islamicists come to this country and they use and abuse our legal system in order to impose their religion on the rest of us well for once the people have risen up and said not here not today its a big victory
3594745 it was a bad crisis for the world it required tough words but also a smart approach to call on the international community to step in and im very very happy that the senators request for a ceasefire has been complied with by president medvedev
3594746 decided to act post haste when an obscure inexperienced wishy washy pansy ss elitist junior senator from il requested after botching his first two statements on the matter the russkies to back off

3594751 yes the sun would have risen just the same yes
3594752 oh come on you cant expect me to believe that its an astronomical fact
3594753 its been a long night grandfather im tired and i need a bath i dont need silliness
3594754 trickery with words i would have thought youd have been more literal minded than that
3594755 im not stupid youre saying humans need fantasies to make life bearable
3594756 i just want to give the generic name horror films to that family of films that take as their subject matter the fear that follows one throughout ones life
3594757 now that i think about it since there are no works that have failed to change my life even a little bit all films are horror films
3594758 terror i think has many different levels changing into something different isnt that scary well maybe a little bit but i think whats scarier than that is not changing at all becoming the same forever without any transformation whatsoever i think that is truly terrifying and if you add to that the condition in which you are the same forever without any alteration i think the condition that most clearly embodies that is death itself
3594759 i dont believe that a film is limited to the beginning and the end of that piece theres a world before and after that all over it and i feel that a film is simply a little window cut out with a little chunk right through it what i tried to accomplish with cure was to leave it very open and to indicate that there is a world before and after that and i hope that people get the sense or maybe the terror at the end that there may be something else so its left open on purpose
3594760 f ilm has a timeline it cant be too short it cant be too long at the outset its not the story or the concept that matter its the framework of the time you may have a story that you want to tell in five minutes or maybe 10 hours but that isnt really a film in the conventional sense what i learned is that film is 90 minutes to 120 minutes long these days it seems to me that they may go a little bit longer than that but that is generally the framework in which you work and how you use that time how much you can tell becomes the real question
3594761 i think that film for me is a medium point between a fictional story and reality you start with the genre which is fiction and gradually move towards reality somewhere in between you find film
3594762 im interested in the values that the individual has come to embrace for the individual to re assess those values and understand the way in which those values that he has come to embrace are in fact the forces that have come to oppress him not something from the outside
3594763 documentarists shoot elements of reality and after that in post production they try to turn it into a lie as much as possible
3594764 t he answer to what is cinema is decided by the audience
3594765 the reason why ghosts tend to be female is that
3594766 is that the protagonist must be taking actions towards a clearly defined goal
3594767 so vital and exciting that they are worth spending your whole life exploring and examining
3594768 bleak climax of an image of a doomed plane spewing black exhaust as it hurtled toward a cityscape
3594769 what i think i learned after sept 11 was that if you are just true to yourself its possible to be entirely overwhelmed and impotent in the face of a much more overpowering force with a stratagem or design of its own somehow maybe at least at the end of my films i need to stake a claim to a direction if not a solution
3594770 i find ghosts in japanese horror much more terrifying in the standard american horror canon because a ghost violently attacks you or comes after you at least you have the chance to fight back and what youre fighting for is the idea that you can beat the bad thing and go back to the good old days when you were peaceful and happy and there werent any ghosts hanging around but if they dont attack you then the best you can do is figure out a way to co exist with them i find the idea that one just has to live with this thing much more terrifying you have no chances of running away or fighting it youre stuck with it forever
3594771 the other great theme of pulse which is that death actually is very close by we tend to live in complete denial about how close death can be its actually very simple very nearby and not so difficult to accomplish very much like it is on the battlefield of war
3594772 look at me i can afford this stuff so i must have it going on

3594781 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
3594782 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
3594783 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
3594784 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
3594785 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
3594786 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
3594787 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
3594788 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
3594789 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
3594790 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
3594791 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
3594792 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
3594793 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
3594794 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
3594795 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
3594796 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
3594797 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
3594798 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
3594799 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
3594800 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
3594801 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
3594802 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
3594803 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
3594804 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
3594805 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
3594806 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
3594807 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
3594808 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
3594809 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
3594810 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
3594811 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
3594812 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
3594813 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
3594814 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
3594815 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
3594816 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
3594817 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
3594818 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
3594819 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
3594820 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
3594821 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
3594822 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
3594823 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
3594824 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot

3594830 i really like being able to put the query logic directly into business layer code instead of being hidden away deep in the bowels of one off repositories or services without sacrificing testability in the domain and service layers
3594831 today in government funded programs and counseling is required for every person regardless of how many times they might have been tested treating the young person who is testing for the first time the same as a who has been tested dozens of times doesnt make sense this important reform will allow ahf the largest hiv tester in california to do three times as many tests per hour as we do now the unanimous approval of the legislature for this common sense approach to hiv testing is very encouraging
3594832 this bill brings the requirements for hiv counseling in line with where we are today in our knowledge and understanding of hiv aids and other stds and it will allow us to focus our counseling efforts where they are most needed to those at high risk and those who may test positive
3594833 the california legislature has recognized the importance of this prudent public health legislation with its unanimous passage in both chambers when this bill is chaptered into law it will allow the department of public health and the state office of aids far more flexibility in its counseling regulations to best serve and reflect the needs of communities throughout california
3594834 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3594835 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3594836 this afternoon i spoke for the second time since the crisis began with georgian president saakashvili it is clear the situation is dire russian aggression against georgia continues with attacks occurring far beyond the georgian region of south ossetia as casualties continue to mount the international community must do all it can to avert further escalations tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border i again call on the government of russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia given this threat to euro atlantic security i am pleased to see the united states the european union and nato acting together by sending a delegation to the region in an effort to broker a cease fire this is an important first step the united nations has been prevented from taking any meaningful action by russian objections in view of this i welcome the statements of democratic nations defending the sovereignty of georgia and condemning russian actions i strongly support the declaration issued by the presidents of poland estonia latvia and lithuania and their commitment that aggression against a small country in europe will not be passed over in silence or with meaningless statements equating the victims with the victimizers
3594837 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
3594838 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
3594839 come on i want my boots licked and if you dont do it now i might not be in the mood again for a very long time
3594840 i think this one now and do a better job worship it dont just lick it like some disgusting animal
3594841 what if i took the belt away then would you want to
3594842 you didnt get the soles earlier so thats where youll start and be sure theyre clean or well keep doing this until they are

3594857 because the soldiers dont pay a dime our waiver of the fees amounts to a discount to the military not a discount to soldiers
3594858 soldiers should not have to pay a penny of it
3594859 thats a lot to ask when the service member has much more important things on their minds such as staying alive and keeping those around them alive
3594860 this should not be a very difficult decision to make

3594862 air transport association member airlines have always been committed to supporting our nations military
3594863 airlines routinely offer special fares for military personnel and families attempt when possible to accommodate unplanned schedule changes and generally seek to do what they can to show their appreciation

3594867 you can not go against nature because when you do go against nature that is part of nature too
3594868 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
3594869 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
3594870 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
3594871 the dirt is too old hard and soft hard and soft
3594872 when the horses hit that thats when they snap their legs
3594873 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
3594874 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
3594875 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
3594876 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
3594877 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
3594878 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
3594879 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
3594880 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
3594881 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
3594882 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
3594883 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
3594884 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
3594885 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
3594886 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
3594887 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
3594888 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
3594889 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
3594890 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
3594891 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
3594892 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
3594893 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
3594894 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
3594895 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention

3594901 here is the conclusion on which i base my facts
3594902 stupidly because i most definitely lost the argument and was condemned for not condemning people with long hair and for preaching a message about the idea that god loves everybody and doesnt hate anybody which according to the 1611 kjv is apparently wrong so after asserting divine authority and being called unspiritual because im not like him i walked away from the argument conversation looking like a huge noob spiritual daddy walking away with my tail between my legs my senior elder monte was nearby and had been watching me at first he pretended to give me a hard time about getting into the argument then he gave me a huge and affectionate side hug and started talking about me to the two guys other pastors that he had been talking to pure love right here i have him take the pulpit a lot too he always brings great messages that challenge us hes also my cell leader

3594907 this was my second official real practice my second full practice im a little behind as far as conditioning mental awareness things like that
3594908 but as far as making my calls making plays on the ball i feel like im doing a good job i think the biggest thing right now is conditioning physically so mentally ill be that much better at the end of practice
3594909 were pretty short back there right now theres not many back there the rotation is no such thing so you just kind of grit your teeth and grind it out
3594910 it doesnt matter whatever side im on whatever is good for the team tackles are a mirror image where you have to do everything opposite you have to change your weight and the plays are opposite you never want to get any quarterback injured especially brady whether you are on the right or left you dont want to get beat you dont want to give up that hit
3594911 its great for the nfl its great for the afc east and its great for cbs i know theyre ecstatic
3594912 i like the last time we played the packers a 35 0 pats win in green bay in 2006 if it can be like that it would be good but he beat us in the super bowl in 96 i think he has more wins against us hes one of the few active players who has more wins against us than losses i hope we can straighten the record out

3594916 i got the injury when we were away and it got worse
3594917 it got worse and then it got better and it was up and down
3594918 it was frustrating but thats football the day you are 100 percent is the first day of practice everybody is beating on everybody and everybody is tired so naturally there are nagging injuries thats part of the game and we have to play with it
3594919 im feeling good and its been a long time waiting
3594920 it feels good to get the pads back on in my second day
3594921 im not feeling hampered at all im feeling a lot better than i felt two years ago when i had rotator cuff surgery i feel good right now i feel strong and ive had some good off field workouts
3594922 usually when you have surgery guys tend to eat more hang around and eat bon bons watching stories

3594931 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3594932 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3594933 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3594934 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3594935 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3594936 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3594937 but the problem is and i dont know if it has to do with all the rain that we had this year was the bottom base it was soft underneath
3594938 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3594939 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3594940 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3594941 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3594942 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3594949 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3594950 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3594960 if you see it touch it if you touch it feel it if you feel it love it if you love it give it
3594961 its just another spin on the same old thing again
3594962 oke pak satu lagi yang saya tanyakan di tengah kesibukan anda sebagai pembicara yang terkenal pernahkah anda memasak utk keluarga anda di rumah
3594963 pertanyaan pertanyaan model seperti ini biasanya mengandung makna yg lebih luas cakupannya
3594964 iya hehe krn dengan pertanyaan model ini kita akan mengetahui secara tidak langsung bagaimana personality seseorang itu dari jawaban yg mereka kemukakan
3594965 sebenarnya sih saya cuma ingin tahu bapak bisa memasak ato tidak
3594966 seseorang yang sibuk seperti saya apakah bisa memasak utk keluarganya iyah saya paham betul ini mengarah kemana nantinya
3594967 memasak utk keluarga itu sebenarnya mengandung arti yg lebih luas yang pertama adalah sejauh manakah kepentingan keluarga itu berarti utk seseorang
3594968 sehingga seseorang tersebut bersedia mengorbankan waktu dan kepentingan pribadinya utk memberikan perhatian yg lebih terhadap keluarganya
3594969 karena memasak utk keluarga itu memberikan impact yg lebih signifikan dibandingkan dengan hanya sekedar meluangkan waktu untuk bermain bersama di taman atau jalan jalan bareng di mall
3594970 dengan memasak utk keluarga seseorang akan mendapat impact yg lebih bersifat personal kenapa saya blg begitu krn pada saat kita makan bersama biasanya byk sekali yg kita obrolkan apalagi dengan keluarga pada saat makan bersamalah anak kita lebih merasa nyaman utk bertukar pikiran dengan kita begitu juga dengan istri
3594971 ya pernah bahkan untuk menebus keabsenan saya akhir akhir ini begitu saya pulang nanti saya akan memasak sesuatu utk keluarga saya
3594972 luar biasa tp saya dengar tadi kalo itu yg pertama apa yang kedua
3594973 nah yang kedua adalah pertanyaan model seperti itu mengandung muatan yg boleh dikatakan agak diskriminatif lho diskriminatifnya dimana diskriminatifnya adalah apakah saya yg notabene ini adalah seorang lelaki yg bertindak sebagai kepala rumah tangga tidak bersedia melakukan pekerjaan yg biasanya dilakukan oleh wanita yg mana dalam hal ini wanita bertindak sebagai ibu rumah tangga yang posisinya secara penilaian masyarakat lebih rendah daripada posisi kepala rumah tangga
3594974 ya terang saja menurut saya pekerjaan memasak itu bukan hanya pekerjaan seorang wanita atau ibu rumah tangga semata tapi pekerjaan kita juga sebagai lelaki atau kepala rumah tangga
3594975 ini inilah paham yg harus kita hapus dari pandangan masyarakat pada umumnya yaitu paham dimana memasak adalah tugas wanita memasak adalah tugas ibu rumah tangga
3594976 wah luar biasa memang pemikiran bapak ini begitu kritislah istilahnya terhadap problem problem sosial di masyarakat
3594977 maaaaa makanannya mana papa lapar nih 1 teriak sang pembicara dari dapur sedikit kesal
3594978 lhooo katanya papa mau masakin kita makanan sehabis pulang interview
3594979 ya ampunnnn maaa papa kan capek abis perjalanan seharusnya mama ngerti dong
3594980 iya tapi kan sudah jadi tugasnya mama utk masakin kita semua makan siang

3594986 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade the 1973 supreme court ruling granting women a constitutional right to abortion and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion
3594987 we could truly make reducing the abortion rate in america a non partisan issue and a bipartisan cause it is a common sense approach
3594988 our joint terrorism task force is involved in this simply because the victim here is from another country and it just kind of makes sense that our terrorism guys would take a look a look at this
3594989 it was used in concentration camps in world war ii and by saddam hussein against the kurds in the 1990s
3594990 and put it in a little capsule it is in fact used as a suicide pill just like you see in the movies
3594991 about the rocket firing i think those who are responsible are those who collaborate with israel because there is a consensus by all palestinian groups to respect the truce
3594992 on his part mp jamal al khudari the head of the popular committee against the siege strongly denounced tuesday the israeli decision to close the crossings noting that the gaza commercial crossings are already paralyzed despite the calm
3594993 we have not conducted any investigation as there has not been any crime reported to us
3594994 mashai stressed however that his comments did not constitute recognition of israels legitimacy
3594995 theres still a feeling the wages numbers are not sufficient to stop to the reserve bank from easing rates thats why weve seen a new probable low in the australian dollar
3594996 this plan is totally unacceptable because we insisted to the israelis that the border can only be on the basis of 1967

3595006 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
3595007 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
3595008 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
3595009 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway

3595013 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
3595014 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
3595015 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
3595016 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
3595017 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me

3595028 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
3595029 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother

3595064 were not interested in a military solution here were interested in a dialogue
3595065 i have made it clear and i again make it clear australia of course stands ready to contemplate humanitarian assistance
3595066 thereve been a large number of civilians whove been killed or injured or displaced
3595067 this does set the scene for a ceasefire although we do know that there is still sporadic fighting going on
3595068 with this project weve identified a new player in vascular development
3595069 a lot of experiments we cant do in humans and it is easier to do in other species

3595109 its kind of bad to say but i think the best way to handle this level of event is to almost become somewhat withdrawn from the magnitude of it and just think of it in terms of weve got the same competitors weve got the same staff its the same
3595110 were at a big bike race weve put in a lot of work weve also got to remember its business as usual

3595117 the tragic effect of these events upon your son who i have no doubt you love sincerely is one of the most disturbing features of this crime
3595118 asking hard questions about how we get this process on track
3595119 our sailors and their families are relying on the navy and its contractors to deliver the quality housing they deserve last weeks articles raised serious concerns about how well that process is moving forward
3595120 senator nelson generally doesnt discuss whether hes placed a hold a presidential nominee
3595121 but i will say that he has several concerns regarding the presidents pick to head the air force including the housing mess at some of the bases
3595122 renovations of the whidbey apartments and apache street homes have not been undertaken at this time and are not scheduled to start in 4 6 weeks
3595123 prior to beginning any renovations forest city and the navy will be carefully assessing the current housing situation at nas whidbey island before determining what next steps should be taken
3595124 the 240 homes that are articulated in the whidbey option were not and are not included as part of the original design build contractual scope the whidbey option has always been contemplated by the navy as an option to consider an alternative course of action that the navy could exercise to expand the original scope of work
3595125 they seem to have been depending on us more than they should have been
3595126 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

3595128 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3595129 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3595130 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3595131 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3595132 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3595133 for the purpose of gaining exclusive access to the lucrative replacement hip knee and joint industry and to the orthopedic industry in general

3595135 the defendants kickbacks and illegal payments prevented mccullough from competing in the replacement hip knee and joint industry in his territory and destroyed his business

3595146 he probably created lifelong memories for many families in the area
3595147 frank had just come to the point where he felt he had the freedom to enjoy his hobby as a career

3595152 reagan had tried to bring about big changes in civil rights enforcement and to pursue a much more conservative approach but it didnt stick

3595206 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices up and we also want to know how fuelwatch wont squeeze out independents
3595207 until we are satisfied with those two questions family first cant support fuelwatch
3595208 the senate is not a rubber stamp any more and it means the australian public cannot be taken for granted
3595209 it became abundantly clear that this isnt going to work at all for consumers
3595210 the big issue here is you need to have competition amongst the big four oil companies thats where the problem is
3595211 the governments scheme just wont work and i wasnt prepared to risk putting up fuel prices on the basis of overwhelming evidence
3595212 people are saying they like the transparency factor but they dont like prices being fixed for 24 hours
3595213 it is anti competitive and it means the independents in particular cant drop their prices to meet the supermarkets
3595214 would you allow one of our people to come down and verify the body
3595215 the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi

3595229 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3595230 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3595231 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3595232 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3595233 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3595234 make no mistake about it this campaign was never about sen regola this campaign is about and always will be about the issues and how they relate to you
3595235 i have always intended to focus on the issues ive never intended to focus on anything else including personal problems
3595236 my focus on this campaign has been totally on the issues at hand and how those issues relate and impact the lives of voters and our constituents
3595237 the conspiracy thwart ed the investigators ability to determine whether federal crimes were committed in connection with those matters
3595238 he got no benefit other than holding on to his job
3595239 boss is driving us all nuts with this fbi madness
3595240 i love my job and wouldnt trade it for any job in the senate
3595241 i think we want to put cameras where we see the majority of crimes taking place
3595242 im hoping for at least 2 5 million in savings
3595243 i havent talked to him about the senate race but we talked about diabetes
3595244 this would be a good forum for him to discuss how hes coped with diabetes
3595245 chris has a real talent for public media type service
3595246 we have to work to try eradicating what i consider to be the most severe illness in the united states
3595247 i can only speculate as to why i believe they were legally wrong and that they became aware of the publics sensitivity about forcing the identification of a rape victim for no purpose except to intimidate her
3595248 complaints would be appropriate if this movie wasnt as side splitting as it consistently is or if it didnt have the guts and discipline to take its premise to the wall and crash right through it
3595249 makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3595250 but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3595251 in our culture retard and retarded carry a lot of baggage from the days when people were institutionalized in large state facilities
3595252 today children with all types of disabilities are included in all types of schools people are employed in all types of jobs they work they vote they pay taxes they dont deserve to be treated in such a dehumanizing way
3595253 adults with retardation self advocated they clearly told us that the use of the word retarded was very hurtful words like retard idiot and moron create negative stereotypes that lead to discrimination and often times abuse just as certain words do for african americans or people of the jewish faith
3595254 and its not a mental disability its an intellectual disability because it involves abstract thinking and comprehension
3595255 theres probably nothing more fundamental to civil rights than the ability to name oneself you wouldnt call someone a negro today and we use asian instead of oriental
3595256 even if the movie is spectacular it imbeds that speech in society you cant legislate against it but you can advocate about the damage that gets done
3595257 thats not even a question it went by the wayside years ago because its so offensive
3595258 thats entertainment theres a lot thats offensive in the movies you vote with your dollars plenty of people will see it because its offensive thats the world we live in
3595259 we barely develop a relationship with one of the commanders and next thing we know theyre gone
3595260 were getting a well rounded commander at the end of the day

3595266 ill get it your way to the extent the system is able now im moving on to the next person
3595267 did not expect the tremendous amount of responsiveness and action they received from our company
3595268 i would disagree with dropping the case because for the entire year mr cohen knew of those violations
3595269 is not unusual because the city is interested in violations being cured and the property being brought into compliance with applicable codes
3595270 ive always been and will continue to be committed to improving south oakland and the city of pittsburgh
3595271 i believe dropping the case is the citys way of saying they now realize that
3595272 i think judge ricciardi was wise to issue a fine that large
3595273 i have no problem with the fine being waived for any landlord that gets their building into compliance
3595274 there were things that were broken when i moved in that were still broken when i left
3595275 i dont like living in places like that and it seemed like a lot of the places around pittsburgh are like that
3595276 provides very significant wage substantial bonus and pension increases and improves benefit programs for active employees and retirees
3595277 we believe this agreement is in the best interests of our company and all of our stakeholders
3595278 disagreed on the overall public policy merits of legalizing slots but we agree now that the experience of the past several years compels us to make changes public confidence in the gaming control board has been shaken recently and we must restore the complete integrity of the process in the public eye
3595279 we created a new industry in this state and adopted the best practices that we could find from other states but the law was not perfect and we can improve upon it
3595280 lets recognize that these are salaries that reflect the full time nature of the job
3595281 the true identity of the controlling interest in a gaming facility
3595282 the gaming board has done its job well but will consider any suggested improvements if they reach his desk criticism with the benefit of 20 20 hindsight is a disservice to the work the board has done
3595283 you can decide ahead of time when youre not in the fog of the disease and you cant make the decisions for yourself
3595284 whether its the cause or the end all be all is another question
3595285 people are not putting all their eggs in that basket
3595286 it may in the end take a cocktail like we do with hiv
3595287 the big question is what can you do about it as of today theres nothing
3595288 the great usefulness will be when there is a therapy that can prevent the onset of this disease
3595289 i think my plan is to run the bases and show these guys i can do it and then go to sacramento
3595290 it was still a bit painful when i was in arizona but it wasnt locking up or catching
3595291 i was just trying to build up leg strength my doctor told me when i had the surgery that i would probably need a full eight weeks before i was ready for games
3595292 i just want to finish on my terms and get back on the field and help these guys win
3595293 its been depressing and im sure the as fans feel the same way i do
3595294 but its not from a lack of effort weve got a great group of men in here were going to fight until the last day
3595295 in our respectful view the conclusions of the federal court in labatt were not warranted and the court erred in exercising its discretion to vacate the earlier order
3595296 mr gover is a senior counsel and a good guy but hes not the court of appeal
3595297 hes not any sort of judge thats the sort of language of a court of appeal judge chastising a lower court judge i guess if they had a problem with the decision they probably should have appealed it to the real court of appeal
3595298 the private competition law bar will have to move away from its current adversarial approach towards a more co operative model
3595299 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness
3595300 i like the fact that for the most part my poems are pretty accessible
3595301 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness
3595302 i like the fact that for the most part my poems are pretty accessible
3595303 weve been here for a week weve worked out weve experienced the great opening ceremony were ready to start playing
3595304 i am confident i can win the game i have experience pitching against u s hitters and i believe i can do well against them
3595305 weve had so many activities since we got here it finally seems like it has calmed down and we got some work in today we actually ran into korea here before we came out and i think that got the blood flowing as far as that is who we open with tomorrow were excited
3595306 were here for baseball its exciting in the olympic village right now and you see the other u s athletes come in and they have been playing the u s has had a lot of success already and it will be fun to get started tomorrow
3595307 weve played in two games here and would have liked more games
3595308 its a group that seems to be coming together real quick
3595309 it will be quite an assignment for them a lot more than most people think a lot of people think its a slam dunk we played netherlands last year in the world cup which the u s won and it was 1 0 going into the bottom of the eighth in 99 the first year they used pro players the qualifiers were at the pan am games in winnipeg we beat mexico in the semis we killed mexico 2 1 in 10 innings if we lost that we wouldnt have qualified for the olympics where we won our gold medal in 2000
3595310 korea is going to be good playing overall fundamental baseball
3595311 if you dont play your a game you could walk out of here 1 6 in a heartbeat
3595312 pour revenir lexemple des tavernes je suis certain quau bout du compte il nen est sorti que du positif
3595313 i was a little disappointed with our play saturday night and i let the club know about that saturday night after the game
3595314 i felt like we came out sunday with a little bit of lack of focus defensively we start the game with a popup that drops a clement error and then that ball goes into center field
3595315 i just said you know what this is for everybody everybodys got to get the message i made that change and hopefully it wont happen again
3595316 play hard come to the park every day and play hard
3595317 its a phrase you hear in football more than baseball but you cant take plays off
3595318 thats a hard thing over a 162 game schedule its like running ground balls out its a tough challenge to make yourself do it
3595319 joses a very talented player and we dont want this to become a distraction its been dealt with and its over
3595320 taking money and contracts out of the equation for instance getting a veteran who may slip through the waiver process it may look good on paper and create a buzz with the fans and may look like were trying to fill a spot but if we dont really believe that will translate into success in this ballpark and thats very key then it doesnt make sense to do it
3595321 you never want to tell them youre not available but you dont want to get seriously hurt either
3595322 dead arm is kind of normal for this time of year but im glad it wasnt anything big and it was something a couple days could solve it was a good thing to get a little bit of a break
3595323 i think its an obscenity i cannot imagine that people in that situation who did what they did to their own daughter are attempting to profit from it
3595324 we would have seen a lot of children that were cordoned off to one area nurses and doctors would be wearing masks and washing their hands which is very much what we would see today

3595342 we like the formation it tends to balance out defenses and forces them to eliminate some of the things they do not everything obviously but we like the formation
3595343 whether or not we can play it as much as we have in the past is just going to depend on stuff as it happens
3595344 my role is to catch whatever is thrown at me if they want me to go deep ill catch it and if they want me to stay short ill catch it i like the role of being the guy that they want in on goal line situations

3595362 its kind of bad to say but i think the best way to handle this level of event is to almost become somewhat withdrawn from the magnitude of it and just think of it in terms of weve got the same competitors weve got the same staff its the same
3595363 were at a big bike race weve put in a lot of work weve also got to remember its business as usual

3595385 clearly our production will vary from month to month but we are targeting to ship 2 000 metric tons in 2008
3595386 so far management has been unable to provide evidence that high production volume in the 1 000 tonnes range can be achieved concomitant with high purity and low cost

3595392 cyberbullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
3595393 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area

3595395 moreover the vehicle for the cyberbullying at issue here a social only became mainstream after 2000

3595445 all the young girls are taught to believe that marriage is the only legitimate object of a womans pursuit
3595446 there exists in the minds of men a tone of feeling toward women as toward slaves
3595447 much of her writing seems premised on a feeling of abandonment and a matching effort to deny overcome or reflect on a sense of solitude
3595448 women are enable to undertake business of the most delicate and important character
3595449 society is clearly unjust to woman in according her but 4 to 8 per month for labor equally repugnant with and more protracted than that of men of equal intelligence and relative efficiency whose services command from 10 to 20 per month
3595450 dickinson began to restrict her social activity in her early 20s staying home from communal functions and cultivating intense epistolary relationships with a reduced number of correspondents
3595451 the fact that she alone had borne the pangs of their birth and nourished their infancy does not give an equal right to them
3595452 dickinson might appear as a feminist ahead of her time renouncing social conventions to love a rich and contented life devoted to art
3595453 male artists are typically viewed as transcending mental illnesses through their art while womens genius is a mere byproduct of illness
3595454 i urge your generous consideration for as my heart swells with pride to behold woman in the highest walks of literature and art it grows big enough to take in those who are bleeding in the dust

3595456 edna i have good news and bad news the good news is youre being discharged since you were able to rationally respond to a crisis by jumping in and saving the life of another patient i have concluded that your act displays sound mindedness the bad news is ralph the patient you saved hung himself with his bathrobe belt in the bathroom i am so sorry but hes dead

3595464 my father devoted all his life and energy into these martial arts skills
3595465 family heirlooms or what people call intangible cultural heritages must be handled with genuine respect
3595466 the outer form school looks really beautiful and puts on a good show meanwhile the internal school does not look good at all but it is real kungfu
3595467 gradually you will enjoy doing it and be unwilling to give it up no matter what happens in your personal life devotion to martial arts not only maintains your health but also makes your willpower stronger
3595468 it was hard time for me i worked during the daytime and trained either in the early morning or evening i also had to support my mom wife and children
3595469 family heirlooms or what people call intangible cultural heritages must be handled with genuine respect
3595470 when he grows up and takes learning kungfu seriously he will still have to go through such a sacred ceremony
3595471 only those who are trust worthy will get the chance to inherit and then pass on the treasures to future generations
3595472 compared to other kungfu masters this is a very humble number
3595473 the quality of the students is far more important than quantity
3595474 guos seemingly outdated way of teaching traditional chinese marital arts makes one rethink how we should pass on the cherished cultural heritage effectively

3595518 the question is where will the number level off at for china in the next few months

3595520 i think a drop of 20 is a bit over done
3595521 weve fallen too far too fast i expect the market to sit between 110 and 120 in the short term
3595522 when everything gets complicated and you feel overwhelmed think about it this way you gotta do three things first get the cow out of the ditch second find out how the cow got into the ditch third make sure you do whatever it takes so the cow doesnt go into the ditch again

3595527 what we want if we still can is to save the democratic party from itself
3595528 we feel theres been a coup that the dnc no longer represents the will of the democratic party
3595529 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
3595530 its very very possible clinton could get nominated she has many votes
3595531 i have to assume from past convention experience that its something the obama campaign and hillary clintons people are talking about quite extensively this is now in the realm of inside baseball i just dont know
3595532 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success
3595533 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
3595534 i am a democratic voter and member of puma pac we represent the more than 18 million american voters who supported sen clinton and who reject the selection of
3595535 only sen clinton can win back the white house for our party in november
3595536 please do your job and support sen clinton for nomination in denver
3595537 the struggle is no longer getting it there but trying to market and promote once it is there
3595538 its all social network type stuff blogs are a huge part of the equation too and internet radio like woxy com also plays a big role
3595539 i just send out bulletins on myspace and i have an e mail list that i send out
3595540 but whether or not theres a carry over effect in a general election thats another thing entirely
3595541 the embedded republican vote in a presidential election has been fairly solid for almost three decades now so you would have to say that mccain has an edge but im going to tell you that the obama people have been pouring resources in here
3595542 the obama campaign has some potential to win some voters to change the dynamics by making a strong run in the big metropolitan areas here filled with high tech workers and the type of people who dont fit the classic old south new south model
3595543 i dont think obamas going to pull through in north carolina hes just not going to get enough of the white vote
3595544 hagan will succeed to the extent that she can build upon discontent with the war in iraq and with the economy
3595545 mccains greatest strength is that this has become a fairly red state
3595546 may have some selling to do with the conservatives in the state
3595547 whats up with alan is he okay did he break his arm did he forget to sit at his computer today to type out some magical nonsense that only he understands what is wrong with him where did he go

3595575 the promise that the wealth would spill over into homestead
3595576 depleted stripped and left to die like a carcass in the desert
3595577 what we did not get is anything on this side of the railroad tracks
3595578 generated thousands of jobs and millions of dollars annually in new taxes to the community and school district
3595579 these are service jobs that dont sustain a family and dont support our communities

3595582 he probably created lifelong memories for many families in the area
3595583 frank had just come to the point where he felt he had the freedom to enjoy his hobby as a career
3595584 he was without a doubt the friendliest person you could ever meet if you met him you felt like he had been your friend forever
3595585 a voracious aptitude for learning the things he needed to know to do the job he had been assigned he just did the best he could each step along the way
3595586 a real love of his partly i think because he didnt have a formal education
3595587 are we going to go and get a drink with clayton and lauren and h
3595588 no not today clayton hurt his knee at work and has to use crutches like daddy did a few weeks ago
3595589 are we going to go with clayton and lauren and h to the hospital
3595590 did clayton cry when he got hurt like i cried when the little neighbor boy pushed me down
3595591 does he have to have an operation like ethan did on his eye

3595594 it is certainly the most demanding american stage race and i expect it to be one of the most competitive
3595595 but i think it is the type of race that really suits team type 1
3595596 this may be the biggest mountain event hes done with the team this year but he is so on top of his diabetes management that im sure he is going to play a big part in our attack
3595597 with moises and glen both making their olympic team selection and in beijing we are going to be at a bit of a disadvantage

3595724 the true identity of the controlling interest in a gaming facility

3595788 there have been a number of events that have occurred and collectively have made folks uneasy and understandably so our task in the near term and in the months ahead is to get after this stabilize our situation and recommit ourselves to those things that we know will produce the right outcomes

3595822 i dont know much about him as far as his maturity but baseball wise he can pitch at this level that was my first impression
3595823 i knew it was a situation where you had to put someone out there to try to keep us in the game i didnt get the job done
3595824 you just try to make your pitches no matter how you feel and locate the ball well and make them put the ball in play
3595825 i have doubts if he wants to pitch hes going to go through a lot of stuff i think joses willing to do it
3595826 production cant be that high since the crop was hurt by unseasonable rains earlier this year dry weather and high fertilizer prices
3595827 the dry period in july with much less rain than previous years meant some trees shed fruit but i dont think the damage will be that much
3595828 the region is not yet seeing any dramatic reduction in crop potential
3595829 but good august rains will be important to ensure recent drier trends dont become a more dramatic issue
3595830 the dry weather was part of the reason the beans shed
3595831 in addition when there is no rain you cant put fertilizer on the trees if you do the chemical will burn the tree

3595841 i just want to give the generic name horror films to that family of films that take as their subject matter the fear that follows one throughout ones life
3595842 now that i think about it since there are no works that have failed to change my life even a little bit all films are horror films
3595843 terror i think has many different levels changing into something different isnt that scary well maybe a little bit but i think whats scarier than that is not changing at all becoming the same forever without any transformation whatsoever i think that is truly terrifying and if you add to that the condition in which you are the same forever without any alteration i think the condition that most clearly embodies that is death itself
3595844 i dont believe that a film is limited to the beginning and the end of that piece theres a world before and after that all over it and i feel that a film is simply a little window cut out with a little chunk right through it what i tried to accomplish with cure was to leave it very open and to indicate that there is a world before and after that and i hope that people get the sense or maybe the terror at the end that there may be something else so its left open on purpose
3595845 f ilm has a timeline it cant be too short it cant be too long at the outset its not the story or the concept that matter its the framework of the time you may have a story that you want to tell in five minutes or maybe 10 hours but that isnt really a film in the conventional sense what i learned is that film is 90 minutes to 120 minutes long these days it seems to me that they may go a little bit longer than that but that is generally the framework in which you work and how you use that time how much you can tell becomes the real question
3595846 i think that film for me is a medium point between a fictional story and reality you start with the genre which is fiction and gradually move towards reality somewhere in between you find film
3595847 im interested in the values that the individual has come to embrace for the individual to re assess those values and understand the way in which those values that he has come to embrace are in fact the forces that have come to oppress him not something from the outside
3595848 the reason why ghosts tend to be female is that oppressed in life they are more powerful in death so they are able to avenge themselves once they are dead
3595849 is that the protagonist must be taking actions towards a clearly defined goal
3595850 so vital and exciting that they are worth spending your whole life exploring and examining
3595851 bleak climax of an image of a doomed plane spewing black exhaust as it hurtled toward a cityscape
3595852 what i think i learned after sept 11 was that if you are just true to yourself its possible to be entirely overwhelmed and impotent in the face of a much more overpowering force with a stratagem or design of its own somehow maybe at least at the end of my films i need to stake a claim to a direction if not a solution
3595853 i find ghosts in japanese horror much more terrifying in the standard american horror canon because a ghost violently attacks you or comes after you at least you have the chance to fight back and what youre fighting for is the idea that you can beat the bad thing and go back to the good old days when you were peaceful and happy and there werent any ghosts hanging around but if they dont attack you then the best you can do is figure out a way to co exist with them i find the idea that one just has to live with this thing much more terrifying you have no chances of running away or fighting it youre stuck with it forever
3595854 the other great theme of pulse which is that death actually is very close by we tend to live in complete denial about how close death can be its actually very simple very nearby and not so difficult to accomplish very much like it is on the battlefield of war
3595855 long has our nation the united states of america kept the forces of chaos at bay

3595859 why dont they just build a fence around it and give everybody inside three to five
3595860 the issue has been addressed and we hope that the issue continues to be addressed so it is not a concern next year
3595861 according to marguerite everything is accounted for and there are no issues and shes reconciled up to june 2008
3595862 we did ask just so we can abreast of it a monthly report id like to see a monthly reconciliation of whats collected and whats on hand
3595863 i think marguerite was very precise she spoke her opinion she did her job and everything is rectified
3595864 shes addressed it and the prosecutor has assured us everything is ok
3595865 we have invested a lot of money in our system and we try not to pollute wolf creek
3595866 i can only tell you that were going to ask the question and well find out from there
3595867 it is time to sit down at the table with you we spent a lot of time working on possible structures here i need now to have your direct input and opinion about the alternatives today is not the day to do that
3595868 the parties involved here are far more than me were dealing with very high level officials in state government and very interested architectural private investment partners were going to fine tune our thinking in the next few days and be in touch with you in the next couple days
3595869 i am fully prepared to move forward with removal and replacement we did not receive any of the things we talked about receiving very quickly those things need to come to us or i am going to make a motion to end our talks with the architectural board of appeals and go to the zoning board of appeals
3595870 dead skunk in the middle of the road dead skunk in the middle of the road dead skunk in the middle of the road stinking to high high heaven
3595871 in my teaching capacity at heidelberg i apply for an education wild animal collection permit from the state rather than a scientific collection permit
3595872 the education permit allows qualified educators to possess dead wild animal parts nests eggs mounts or study skins and live wild animals for educational programming or display
3595873 the scientific collection permit is primarily used by researchers who survey or inventory wildlife species that are protected collected a term which like taken or sacrificed generally means killed outside regular hunting or trapping seasons collected in excess of daily bag limits or collected by methods that are normally prohibited
3595874 i stopped expanding our collections some few years ago for several reasons
3595875 we have an adequate collection on hand for most of my teaching needs it takes a fair bit of time and skill to prepare scientific specimens in an appropriate manner theres less interest in the taxidermy components of biology than in former years i have limited space for storage of specimens and i personally have little interest in killing animals in order to add to our collections
3595876 thats the worst of it picking up the skunks because of the odor
3595877 they dont smell bad when you are out there but then you come back here and everybody kind of shrugs their nose up at you i make sure i spend most of my day in the office after they send me out for them
3595878 i put them in that and close it as quick as possible
3595879 i take a big can with me so i dont have to touch the edges because it gets all over everything
3595880 i drop it in that and close it up but it seems when you close it up the aroma flies out around you and gets on you and you dont know it you dont smell it after youve been out there when you get back in here staff members like to complain so i pull up a chair and sit out here with the dispatcher for awhile
3595881 we usually write it down if we know what it is
3595882 well tell about cats mainly occasionally a dog but cats seem to be the ones they let run all the time then people dont know where their cat is at when they dont see it for a week then they call and asked if we picked one up
3595883 of those who came it seemed like they were looking for reasons to support it
3595884 i believe this is the time to go for it
3595885 in this time we do have to know what our priorities are

3595890 of course of course we needed a hip hop song about not wanting to wake up in the morning and we always wanted to hear someone rap about the evils of consumerism gone bad we needed a song about escaping from a prison planet run by giant bugs why hasnt anyone else written a short song about not wanting to help your friends move hell theres even one song about a parade not happening on his new album of course

3595899 the crossbench senators and the government are coming from the same direction
3595900 we want to see more transparency and competition in the fuel market

3595919 its very intimidating to see him back there because you see this young man can get from the middle of the field to the sidelines

3595969 yes profe ssor my point is your philo sophi cal premi se is flawe d to start with and so your concl usion must also be flawe d
3595970 you are worki ng on the premi se of duali ty
3595971 you argue that there is life and then there s death a good god and a bad god you are viewi ng the conce pt of god as somet hing finit e somet hing we can measu re sir scien ce can t even expla in a thoug ht
3595972 it uses elect ricit y and magne tism but has never seen much less fully under stood eithe r one to view death as the oppos ite of life is to be ignor ant of the fact that death canno t exist as a subst antiv e thing death is not the oppos ite of life just the absen ce of it

3595983 i will tell mommy that you talked to a stranger
3595984 hubert humphrey won the nomination but the democratic party was still divided particularly because vice president humphrey did not disassociate himself from johnsons vietnam war policy i too opposed the war but wanting to get a democrat in the white house i stuffed many humphrey for president leaflets under apartment doors that fall
3595985 it is necessary to disrupt the status quo that is the tradition of our country our founders were disrupters magnificent disrupters martin luther king jr was a disrupter as were the suffragettes it is the american way the change that resulted from these leaders has made our country greater how can we follow their lead
3595986 people always ask arent you scared and i say just strike that word from your vocabulary this is not for the faint of heart you cant be afraid you have a vision knowledge a plan you have support this is what you believe in if you show one cent of being afraid your options are destroyed so you have to believe in what you are doing and you may not win every fight but you will advance the cause
3595987 the challenges of success as well as the lessons of failure organize dont agonize politics is not for the faint of heart dont let me give you this impression that people are waiting with open arms to pull you into power nobody nobody ever in the history of the world has given away power
3595988 let me say that washington dc is a city that is wedded to the status quo change is not what they are about and as a leader i say you must be kidding the city is wedded to the special interests because they all make a living perpetuating the status quo its the special interests not the peoples interest and that is why it was so important if i may have a moment of partisan enjoyment that we won the last election i have become the speaker of the house not because i mastered the inside of things but because i am an outsider and i want change to happen here
3595989 well throw you a crumb and well keep the status quo that is not the american way our founders in this city where it all started they were disrupters sometimes you wonder why you have to go to such lengths to convince people of the obvious about the future
3595990 we have a foreign policy question the actual question is do you think we should blockade iran
3595991 i think we should ask a broader question do you think there is a desire and a plan on the part of this administration to engage iran
3595992 iran keeps insisting that they want to proceed on developing nuclear power they say for domestic use we suspect they have other motives they cannot be allowed to do this
3595993 a lot of technology from china from pakistan probably from russia and other places and that should never have happened
3595994 i hope for the best in terms of iran i suspect the worst
3595995 the last resort consequences of preventive military action against iran
3595996 fears that it would prompt a rally round the flag effect in iran
3595997 u s is respected for its commitment to multilateral diplomacy
3595998 but i dont think anything can be accomplished by going into iran to stop them from developing weapons of mass destruction because that would only galvanize the country around the leadership thats a b we may not accomplish our goal they may have parallel program where we think we got it but we didnt get it or we got part of it and we didnt get the rest and what have we accomplished in terms of world opinion at the same time
3595999 what we should be doing and theyre trying to do this more but we should have been doing it more robust and sooner is to say to iran dont even think about having a weapon of mass destruction and were galvanizing world international global forces diplomatically economically culturally financially economically to pass sanctions to tighten and tighten and tighten if you proceed down this course
3596000 the president of iran has said i have friends well if those friends want to be friends with iran then we cant have them be friends of ours because our foreign policy is that we cannot permit proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
3596001 you cant be friends with me if youre going to be friends with them
3596002 and let me just say this war in iraq has been a horrendous dilemna a grotesque mistake
3596003 they went into that war knowing full well there was no intelligence to support the imminent threat that this administration was contending i was a senior democrat on the intelligence committee at the time its called the gang of four the top democrats and the top republicans in the house and in the senate and we saw all of the intelligence and there was no intelligence to say that there was an imminent threat of weapons of mass destruction from iraq it was clear i voted against the war i had all the intelligence and i knew the threat wasnt there so this administration knew all this faulty intelligence stuff they knew it wasnt there
3596004 i applaud the presidents focusing on this issue and on taking the lead to disarm saddam hussein
3596005 yes he has chemical weapons he has biological weapons and he is trying to get nuclear weapons
3596006 i would imagine its those feelings in iraq that led to this next question are you going to allow a motion to impeach president bush to come to the floor
3596007 and this all occurs before the election in 2004 where was the outrage why do you think the democrats lost in 2004
3596008 the search is for truth the search is for truth to take our country in the direction of our founders with their magnificent disruption we have to continue in the tradition of the magnificent disruption and one way for that to happen is for women to know their power
3596009 you were briefed about torture and the wiretapping years before the public found out why didnt you use your
3596010 you were briefed as a member of the gang of four about torture in 2002 and as the gang of eight about wiretapping
3596011 not these kind of questions were not taking these kinds of questions youre done

3596033 now what is the true purpose of them descending upon us thus
3596034 they want to conquer lah habislah kampung kita tempat kita pun tak ada
3596035 they are afraid if anwar becomes prime minister they are afraid what projects they can get from the government now will be affected
3596036 we just hope everybody can cool down whats happened to anwar let it not happen to anyone else not even dollah or najib we are going forward the country is going to prosper our mission once we rule the country nobody should suffer as our family has suffered let it end with anwar

3596075 the crossbench senators and the government are coming from the same direction
3596076 we want to see more transparency and competition in the fuel market
3596077 the only people opposed to that transparency are the opposition theyll oppose fuelwatch which means well have discussions with the other senators as weve begun to do and were always going to need to do
3596078 all legislation in the current environment is requiring discussion and negotiation to get through the senate and im particularly unsurprised that fuelwatch would be any different
3596079 the number of independents in wa has gone down by no more than in any other state and territory in australia and indeed independents have reduced in numbers around the world so theres no evidence theres any link between fuelwatch and a reduction in independents at all
3596080 he has to put his hand up and say that fuelwatch is dead
3596081 really were just picking over the bones and hes just making a fool of himself hanging around it
3596082 we dont have that yet and we believe you should get the information in and you should look at what the facts are before you make up your mind
3596083 but senator fielding and senator xenophon are new players there and theyve made a decision early on thats fine
3596084 it is unacceptable that anyone involved in a stabbing walks away without any action being taken by government
3596085 its unacceptable to lock up children but it is equally unacceptable not to use the resources of government to ensure that the child is given appropriate care and attention as a result of this issue
3596086 over recent weeks the 90 day bank bill rate has fallen considerably this rates often used as an indicator of banks marginal cost of funds particularly at the short end
3596087 looking over the last two or three weeks the 90 day bill rates down around half a per cent so thats significantly reduced the banks marginal cost of short term funding
3596088 i think that means that theres no obvious reason that the banks could not pass through any change in the cash rate
3596089 the issues and challenges which dominated the global financial services industry throughout the 2008 financial year will continue to dictate the outlook for the australian banking sector for some time
3596090 the disruption to global credit markets higher wholesale funding costs and slowing economic growth will continue to have a significant impact for australian banks for calendar 2009 and potentially beyond
3596091 while there are clearly a number of negatives at work in the australian economy there are some balancing factors these include the huge income boost from rising commodity prices respectable growth in the economies of our major asian trading partners tax cuts and robust business and infrastructure spending
3596092 the balance of these opposing forces favours continued modest economic and credit growth not too far below the average of the past decade given current circumstances however we intend to maintain a cautious and conservative stance going into the new financial year
3596093 certainly our pricing is a little sharper than our competitors basically around four or five basis points

3596155 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3596156 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3596157 it solidifies us as the place to go for the cool stuff

3596161 here is a representation that should give you a rough idea of performance
3596162 uhh i check those sites daily because theyve established a long history of quality content it started out with reading kotaku and over the years ive come to check the rest of those blogs daily for stuff to digg sometimes i click through to the original source and digg that other times not i always appreciate feedback and it looks like based on your profile this is a big issue with you ill do my best to link directly to the source when it has an equal or better writeup and hasnt already been dugg oh and if gawker media is paying me every time you guys click a story this would definitely be the first ive heard about it
3596163 the pay rate per pageview on gawker is now 5
3596164 this means that for gawker writers a million pageviews a month to an individual writers blog posts will now net that writer 5000
3596165 if it says so in the ad then it has to be true
3596166 steve jobs is god apple can do no wrong the iphone will change your life 11 1
3596167 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3596168 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3596169 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3596170 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3596171 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3596172 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3596173 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3596174 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3596175 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3596176 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3596177 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3596178 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3596179 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3596180 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3596181 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3596182 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3596183 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3596184 is fighting hard and remains in serious but stable condition
3596185 como muita massa e pizza e durmo o m ximo que posso eu odeio perder
3596186 its going to be a lot easier to do homework its actually going to be a bit more resourceful for schools because were not going to be wasting so much money on paper
3596187 our students are living in a technological world and yet our educational system is still very much rooted in the 19th century
3596188 we filter internet content for computers that are on our network we do that now and these laptops are also going to be filtered in exactly the same way when theyre off of our network

3596193 the academy made me shape up my life and lose less to donkeys
3596194 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3596195 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3596196 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3596197 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3596198 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3596199 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3596200 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3596201 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3596202 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3596203 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3596204 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3596205 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3596206 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3596207 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3596208 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3596209 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3596210 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3596211 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3596212 a wise man can see more from the bottom of a well than a fool can see from the top of a mountain

3596224 ive been following it a little bit but my husband is more into it than i am hes just so proud of phelps he certainly has a lot to be proud of
3596225 i was at my tv going crazy especially for that relay they had ive definitely been keeping up on him
3596226 thats whats so special about the olympics it gives you a chance to watch sports and incredible athletes you might otherwise not ever have the chance to see
3596227 the interest in swim teams is definitely on the upswing because of him
3596228 were going to see an upswing because of their example the word has been amazing down here
3596229 the shouting in my house last night when we were watching him was louder than the thunder and lightning last week
3596230 im completely excited about it ive been following the entirety of his career pretty much
3596231 its wonderful its everything i cant wait until tomorrow night
3596232 hes shattered records that have been in the olympics for quite a while
3596233 as far as im concerned hes one of the main reasons to watch the olympics this week
3596234 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3596235 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3596236 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3596237 i would have liked to medal but i got my first personal best of the meet and i think thats a good effort
3596238 i cant be upset with that and im just moving on to the next heat
3596239 yo ahorita me presento con el club a hacer el viaje nos lo inform cant y el entrenador ahorita nos vamos el cata y yo

3596241 peace is not working these militants are not interested in peace
3596242 all americans are our enemy now not just the american government
3596243 weve been following oil and gas development in the amazon since 2004 and the picture has changed before our eyes
3596244 when you look at where the oil and gas blocks are they overlap perfectly on top of the peak biodiversity spots almost as if by design and this is in one of the most if not the most biodiverse place on earth
3596245 the real concern is when exploration is successful and a zone moves into the development phase because thats when the roads drilling and pipelines come in
3596246 theyre not looking at the bigger picture of what happens if there are lots of projects going on at the same time
3596247 you could have each individual company thinking theyre being relatively responsible and keeping their own road networks under control and so on but what happens when you have 15 other projects around you all of a sudden when you look at the bigger picture you have a sprawling road network
3596248 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3596249 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognise indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent
3596250 the investment bank continues to be negatively affected by the disruption in the credit and mortgage markets as well as by overall lower levels of liquidity and wider credit spreads

3596252 god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
3596253 weve been doing this a long time and made all the mistakes for our members along the way we know what works and what doesnt
3596254 its crazy to spend thousands and thousands of dollars on programmers and designers when the tools for 95 of most small business situation are available at low or zero cost the best part is that a lot of the pieces you need to to create a small business website snap together like tinkertoys
3596255 ask my friends too they always think about sex too
3596256 its time to respect the will of the american people to expand their access to arguments and facts that address issues central to their daily lives

3596258 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
3596259 the visit is the latest in a eries of moves by arab states that iraqi and u s officials say could improve security and counter the influence of shiite led iran a player here in economic diplomatic and security matters
3596260 iraq had planned to give the monarch a state welcome but instead the king arrived and left with no fanfare the announcement of his visit came as he boarded a plane to leave iraq
3596261 u s officials had been urging king abdullah to visit iraq to bolster ties between the two countries as part of washingtons campaign to shore up support for the iraqi government as a counterweight to iranian influence
3596262 jordan hosts about 500 000 iraqi refugees who have fled violence in their war torn country and amman has estimated the costs of sheltering them so far at more than 1 3 billion euros 2 billion

3596264 sajida baha al deen from mansour baghdad and has been in damascus for 16 months she turned to sex work to provide for herself and her two children what matters is that i am still standing on my feet she said after a short storm of tears came and went something in your sould gets numb one year after her husbands death shiite militias sprayed her hairdressing salon with bullets and looted the remains in september 2006 at 2 a m 12 masked men barged through her bedroom door threatening to end her life and that of her two sunni named boys bakar now age 9 and omar age 10 because her husband was an american collaborating traitor
3596265 at the airport some of the returnees said they were returning because their savings had run out others said they had been ill treated and had no rights in the host countries
3596266 incredibly the only doctor who did treat it who founded a medical center in the name of his own autistic son has fled the country he left behind some social workers who try their best to help but even they havent been paid in four months

3596268 the clinton camp is quite happy with the platforms including of language to the effect that clinton placed 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling an allusion to her winning 18 million votes during the primaries
3596269 because a large chunk of clintons 18 million supporters are upset that the obama campaign has not been more gracious toward senator clinton and has done little to reach out to her former supporters
3596270 he should be in myrtle beach and you know if hes going to take a vacation at this time and i just think this is not the time to do that

3596281 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3596282 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3596283 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3596284 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3596285 para m no deber a de haber m s de tres jugadores en caso de que re nan el perfil que el t cnico no encuentre en otro jugador mexicano hay buenos jugadores como el caso de gabriel caballero y de antonio naelson quien se nacionaliz desde que estaba en primera a y yo creo que no lo hizo pensando en la selecci n mexicana habr a que reconocer las aspiraciones leg timas de los jugadores que se nacionalizan
3596286 yo s creo que debe de existir un l mite porque m s all de lo futbol stico yo creo que la identidad nacional se da por muchos otros factores no s lo al vivir muchos a os en el pa s hay que reconocer que hay personas que se han nacionalizado despu s de muchos a os y cuando lo llevamos al deporte algunos en otros pa ses se nacionalizan por accesar a una selecci n o por ocupar una plaza menos de extranjero en sus clubes de origen
3596287 ah es donde creo que la federaci n mexicana como pol tica de registro debe de poner un l mite no debe haber una selecci n como en alguna ocasi n la tuvo espa a en 1962 en la que ocho integrantes eran sudamericanos nacionalizados espa oles
3596288 ser la quinta ocasi n en la que cruz azul busque mostrarse ante una afici n muy diferente ser una visita en la que se pretende establecer una buena relaci n deportiva con europa me hubiera gustado obtener al menos el empate ante san luis a media semana para irnos con m s tranquilidad ya que al regresar nos esperan ocho partidos per os creo que la oportunidad que tiene benjam n galindo en esta gira de rotar a sus jugadores hay ocasiones en las que me ha gustado el accionar pero no estamos todav a satisfechos y galindo se los puede decir

3596297 i struggle to find evidence of beauty in contemporary art if i go to an exhibition i pretend to understand like many others but honestly i dont understand
3596298 bondi appears to have fallen asleep in 1895 when the biennale was launched to then reawake in 2008
3596299 you cannot rely on an antiquated concept of beauty thats like wanting to go back to the horse and cart

3596304 we dont take this action lightly we love this airline and we need it to succeed
3596305 the three major constituencies customers employees and stakeholders have all suffered due to his leadership
3596306 this is an obvious and predictable attempt to deflect attention from alpas illegal activity cited in our lawsuit which details the organised and concerted effort to harm our customers our employees and our performance
3596307 everyone is concerned that if airlines are not making money we could be moving to another round of job losses and budget cuts

3596313 to be ready that quick hes going to start in the minor leagues you only have one week to go two weeks to go i need a pitcher to win now next year i dont care about next year i dont i need a pitcher right now we didnt have a conversation about freddy
3596314 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3596315 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3596316 the first i knew about it was when all my other websites started closing down under the strain
3596317 initially it wasnt meant to be looked at by anyone a group of us were putting on an exhibition of the photos and the site was a place where we could look at the pictures while we talked on the phone
3596318 hed been doing it for about a month before he realised hed been taking about one picture a day and then he made a commitment to keep doing that
3596319 thats what he was like there are some people who have flashes of brilliance and do things in a huge rush or creative bursts but he was more of a steady keeps at it kind of guy and he did amazing stuff part of the appeal of the site is that jamie wasnt this amazing looking guy he led an incredible life but theres an everyman quality to the photographs
3596320 he was like no i took a picture of my lunch its already been taken
3596321 theres one woman who appears a lot in the earlier photographs who seems to have been a girlfriend but no one knows who she is
3596322 she has a big boot on her foot and has to keep it elevated
3596323 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3596324 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3596325 representative of the black and gold in new england patriot territory
3596326 it was my daily life but kicked up a notch
3596327 my friend and roommate kyle has a dog named sidney thats not an accident
3596328 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3596329 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3596330 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3596331 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3596332 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3596333 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3596334 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3596335 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3596336 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

3596344 demand destruction is a pretty significant fact in the us and oecd
3596345 so i think it looks as though you are starting to see the impact of higher prices
3596346 the correction in crude oil prices since mid july has been nothing short of massive yet in terms of levels it just brought us back to the april may period so far
3596347 on a six month horizon the outlook for crude oil prices therefore remains negative as even after a correction of more than 30 dollars plenty of air appears to remain at the current level
3596348 the reason for the increase in eibs authorized capital stock by p2 7 billion consisting of 15 billion common shares is to ensure that the company would have enough capital stock in preparation for the capital infusion from potential investors

3596353 some evacuation centres are cramped and they may be fearing that if the centres are bombed they will all be hit

3596393 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones

3596427 and if theres one club that knows how to rock its the guvernment
3596428 this clearly goes against the conditions of their permit which should only centre on their religion and religious activities it will earn the herald another warning letter and probably even a suspension

3596434 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3596435 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3596436 i would have liked to medal but i got my first personal best of the meet and i think thats a good effort
3596437 i cant be upset with that and im just moving on to the next heat

3596441 everyone thinks that if we automate the elections then all our problems will go away however if you look at the experience of the united states and other countries who have automated their elections the old problems still persist and new problems crop up

3596452 if we have an opportunity to have somebody purchase the parcels and put them back on the tax rolls so they can contribute again its good for them and its good for the town
3596453 its just kind of uncommon or rare to find a parcel of that size in that kind of condition

3596459 its encouraging to see that thousands of people voted and lets hope that the votes will be higher in the nov 4 election elections are exciting and humbling at the same time
3596460 politician in greek means to offer ones service and i appreciate the people accepting my offer
3596461 so far im feeling good but we havent seen nothing out of lander and humboldt counties
3596462 there are some important local races i think there will be a lot of interest in the general election
3596463 that is a disgusting photo and it should only be shown if youre writing about the abject cruelty shown in the picture have you no heart at all
3596464 you probably put this on just for spite because the vegetarian was offended by all the bloody meat on your last cover animals are creatures who can feel pain it doesnt matter if they can do math
3596465 the red icon on your iphone or ipod touch always reminds you and others when you show it to them that you were able to afford this its a work of art with no hidden function at all
3596466 house speaker nancy pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet
3596467 we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
3596468 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3596469 we are dealing with an attempt to totally occupy georgia
3596470 theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city
3596471 liquidated the danger of fire on south ossetia from the town
3596472 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us and are trying to interfere
3596473 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3596474 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3596475 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3596476 even though it hasnt been take it to the ground and its a soft training camp theres a lot of banging that goes on out there
3596477 you guys want to select one and well put him in just shoulder pads out here and come out for a 9 on 7 someday
3596478 you guys go ahead you need to sign a waiver and id be happy to put you out there in the 9 on 7 and then you could comment afterward on if you think its soft or not
3596479 i dont know about hysterically funny but i am probably a and b i go back to all of the comments about chester taylor in 2006 that said he is not going to be the answer and 2 3 yards per carry in the preseason and then we go about two games in the season and its hes going to set a franchise record for carries and well wear him down at this pace no you have to write what you see so i mean if thats how you see it
3596480 ive got a number in my head of how many he needs to have
3596481 he and i have talked about that he knew full well what he was charged with going into the first game and like i said he gets plenty of work out here in the inside drills
3596482 obviously when you miss two weeks of practice its not where you want it to be
3596483 theres only so much you can do on the elliptical machines thats just part of getting back from an injury ive missed a lot of time ive got some catching up to do
3596484 were always saying gus has been in the league 15 years its crazy because hes still out here doing the same thing were doing were excited for him
3596485 every single year our rates have gone up and up and up
3596486 to me its crazy to keep going on like this
3596487 we would have won iowa clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3596488 the lie certainly would have had an impact on the election
3596489 of course there are lots of reasons to buy short dated out of the money puts the best reason would be if youd been selling a lot of short dated out of the money puts at higher strike prices and you wanted to protect your downside and guess what it turns out that volume in bear stearns put options at 40 and 50 strikes had indeed been rising sharply more generally there was good reason to believe that if bear could make it through the week and start being able to tap the federal reserves liquidity facility then the worst was behind it and it would survive in that case a very sensible trade would be to go long bear stock and hedge with short dated bankruptcy puts which would pay out in case bear imploded over the course of the coming week
3596490 we had a solid second quarter with a substantial improvement in cash used by operations and an improved gross margin the margin improvements were principally due to price increases realized in the market and the 63 increase in volume throughput at the richmond terminal during the quarter which were tempered by increasing fuel costs in shipping our sales contracts allow for the recovery of these increased fuel costs during the following year and there is therefore a timing delay in the recovery of these expenses
3596491 our strong growth continued despite the slowdown in construction activity in california we sold 500 000 tons of sand and gravel in the second quarter bringing our sales total for the first two quarters to 1 02 million tons third quarter sales have been strong and we will ship more than 700 000 tons during the period we anticipate shipping between 2 1 to 2 5 million tons in 2008 an increase of approximately 100 percent over 2007 shipments at the mid point of this range our previously announced acquisition of the pier b land in the port of long beach in collaboration with our strategic alliance partner is due to close on or about august 18th and will create a strategic point of entry into the massive los angeles metropolitan area market beginning early in 2011 we are increasingly well positioned to benefit from the ongoing depletion of indigenous aggregate sources in california and the eventual increase in demand generated by infrastructure commercial and residential construction activity

3596494 nat rlich kann man keine konkrete wettervorhersage f r einen bestimmten termin im august machen allerdings kann man sich ansehen was die langfristmodelle zusammenbasteln und daraus einen groben trend ableiten und da ja ohnehin alle vom wetter reden wie sieht also der wetter trend f r den august 2008 aus
3596495 das lhc ist eine gewaltige chance unser wissen ber das universum zu erweitern aber viele menschen scheinen anstatt dieser enormen m glichkeiten lieber irreale gefahren zu sehen

3596500 while the domestic economy remains reasonably resilient credit growth is expected to moderate as this slowing in the economy impacts our customers

3596507 surat dari kongres as sering kita terima dan bukan ini saja kongres as kan kongres yang paling latah sedunia dan merasa paling berhak mengomentari masalah masalah luar negeri di negara manapun kita sudah kenyang
3596508 saya tekankan teman dan sahabat kita di kongres as lebih banyak dan dubes as juga menekankan bahwa posisi politik mereka tetap sama mendukung nkri termasuk papua sebagai bagian dari nkri

3596514 u verse voice uses the power of ip to enhance the calling experience just like u verse tv has changed the way people watch television u verse voice will change the way people use their home phone
3596515 the expansion of our ip based services to our customers further demonstrates at amp ts strong commitment to roll out new technology to our states residents and businesses
3596516 our deployment of u verse voice is an integral part of the major investment that at amp t has delivered in wisconsin as a result of progressive reform legislation that the legislature and governor enacted
3596517 its going to make an impression on how she sees herself its going to scar her

3596524 the grand jury said there are billions of dollars being filtered illegal money dirty tainted money that are being filtered through some of the money transaction businesses
3596525 im not sure we have the authority to do this today with regard to these but i think we ought to pass it i think we ought to try it it may be legal it may not be legal
3596526 i recognize that things could have been done better it was always my hope that once that audit is completed it will demonstrate that our office has not acted as recklessly if you will as the miami herald suggests

3596534 am i prouder of what we did as a team in singapore than what i did individually probably the answer is yes
3596535 i think the some of the things that we can do off the back of the games are profound the test in this whole project is touching the majority of the population and a large chunk of the world by 2012 and inspiring young people to do things that perhaps they hadnt thought about
3596536 i am sure that people examine their conscious all the time i examined mine when i decided to go to moscow in 1980 and i examined mine when i decided not to compete in south africa during the 1980s athletes organizations and administrations do that all the time
3596537 he felt that when i ran badly he was the architect of a lot of the programs and he couldnt just walk away from some of the responsibility but he was tough i knew that i had a coach that who was made of the right stuff
3596538 i just got excited as my career went on and i was very lucky i probably had the best coach in middle distance ever
3596539 i believe that international sport is a powerful vehicle for change is it a powerful vehicle for brining communities together in a way that sometimes politicians dont manage to do
3596540 you have to tread very carefully when you start attributing to international sport the powers that should be undertaken by united nations security councils international sport can do a great deal but it is not the first line of foreign policy

3596550 consistent with sclcs historic commitment to civil rights and economic justice this partnership represents a critical part of our campaign for economic empowerment
3596551 has been a true friend to the sclc and to the communities and individuals it serves and in our opinion is one of the few financial services companies that is working diligently to increase access to credit in underserved communities
3596552 as a company that provides credit products and financial services to financially underserved consumers compucredit has an abiding interest in working with individuals and third party organizations that share our commitment to financial education and to helping credit challenged consumers bridge their way to a prime credit score and the financial mainstream
3596553 its an indictment of how far sclc has gone from its historic roots these folks owe their existence to a moral claim to helping other black folks this is an outright betrayal of that
3596554 just like they target minority groups to sell their products they target minority groups to make their products look legitimate
3596555 leadership in the struggle for economic justice through the political process
3596556 payday lenders offer a choice that is not widely provided by traditional lenders anymore consequently we think that payday lenders provide a choice that members of our communities should be allowed to make
3596557 no one has explained to me how a person making 6 an hour and is about to get his lights turned off can go and get a loan
3596558 if they improve financial literacy black folks would never go to their stores
3596559 at this time compucredit is not engaged in any activities directly related to historically black colleges and universities
3596560 we have never located any services kiosk portal or other presence on any college campus and there are no plans to do so
3596561 once we learned of some of the practices and the impact on the communities we terminated that relationship
3596562 educate african american legislators and community leaders on critical issues regarding consumer credit
3596563 i do not promote payday lending this is part of our giving back agenda
3596564 we really did not want young people to be exposed to this ugliness
3596565 its sad that they would put children in harms way for a political point
3596566 were not fools the timing was exactly right for them to carry on their political campaign
3596567 a drive through any low income neighborhood clearly indicates people of color are a target market for legalized extortion visits to payday stores which open their doors in low income neighborhoods at a rate equal to starbucks opening in affluent ones are threatening the livelihoods of hardworking families and stripping equity from entire communities
3596568 as a mobile me subscriber i wonder if the opening day trial subscriptions will matter in yet another month thats when for many but not all the 60 day trial period expires if those disappointed with the service choose to flee then perhaps the server load will decrease and performance will improve for the rest of us

3596570 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else

3596580 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3596581 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3596582 i would have liked to medal but i got my first personal best of the meet and i think thats a good effort

3596648 its all systems go for charter change we are supporting senate joint resolution no 10
3596649 into a constituent assembly for the purpose of revising the constitution to establish a federal system of government
3596650 naughty insinuations that she arroyo was going for cha cha charter change because she wants to extend her term in office
3596651 while many of us are pushing for charter change towards the creation of a federal system we cannot allow this goal to undermine a more democratic participatory and deliberative process in changing the constitution
3596652 it is in our opinion that the advocacy for a federal system would be best served under a constitutional convention and not under a con ass
3596653 even how noble the causes are such as a shift to a federal system the elitist process of achieving them such as a constituent assembly will undermine these causes eventually
3596654 once convened there is no guarantee the constituent assembly will pass constitutional revisions limited only to the issue of federalism

3596658 the school has been here since 1889 but the performance space in the auditorium has been here since 1894 the school and the architecture is beautiful so theres a number of things that need to be refurbished
3596659 in recent history weve done a great job in updating technology but one of the things thats happened is our performing arts space in the auditorium since it was built so long ago its become fairly unusable
3596660 on the actual stage area itself the curtain is the original curtain from the late 1800s
3596661 its everything from the lights to the sound to the acoustics the entire place needs to be overhauled
3596662 because of its current condition many of our students have been forced to perform at community theaters and other venues outside of the school
3596663 the auditorium is very much a focal point for our school because we use it every day for something called community gathering which is a more inclusive version of a homeroom period
3596664 im a senior this coming year so i just wanted a theater for people to perform in when im gone
3596665 the theater is in really really bad shape theres so much potential for this theater but no one is using it
3596666 its taken a lot of preparation for this show because theres so many dance numbers
3596667 im a lot like belle she wants to travel the world and do a ton of things i feel a lot of myself in her its a really a fun role to play
3596668 it sort of been in the works in for a while on a number of different fronts
3596669 weve been trying to think of different ways to do this
3596670 for me i think the beast was kind of an interesting role to take on because he goes from being a prince in the beginning to becoming a beast
3596671 i think preparation wise i sat down with the script and tried to make it as realistic as possible so its not the same as the cartoon i think its what people want to see when they go to a musical
3596672 my dad teaches religion at b c high but hes just very good at construction and he just happens to be friends with a private contractor and a president of a construction company

3596677 when i heard about the opportunity to be in a show during the summer and thinking about the kind of community service aspect i became involved
3596678 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head during something that is supposed to be a time of world unity
3596679 i am not giving up hope and i am going to keep pushing
3596680 our next step is to continue to negotiate with the trustees
3596681 i do not believe that the action of the board in trying to appropriate money without my consent has any basis in law
3596682 if we appropriate additional money the budget will be 400 000 out of balance if the board of aldermen passes a budget that is out of balance we will jeopardize the financial security of the city and our triple a bond rating
3596683 it was very clear to the law department and to me that this chapter was not the appropriate vehicle to reinstate funds

3596768 the addition of brian strosser as a vice president and the launch of this new division is just the first of many new initiatives we have planned our customers data protection and management needs storage security and engineering support are expanding and it is vital we are positioned to meet that demand bringing together the sales support and services that we provide under a single strong leader lays the groundwork to significantly grow this segment of our business
3596769 she has a secret plan but doesnt want anyone to know
3596770 we acknowledged that we needed a coherent long term storage strategy for the data the council holds we needed the data to be consolidated to enable centralised management and guaranteed backup and protection against disaster at the same time having a consistently high level of access we enlisted the help of glasshouse to work with us to create a five year strategy to meet our needs and requirements
3596771 after assessing the storage environment at fife council it was clear that the solution required would encompass all storage requirements including disaster recovery backup and a consistent archive policy across the whole organisation
3596772 our role was to help fife council develop an effective and appropriate storage strategy through careful identification and evaluation of the technology and services required then to create an rfp to source a vendor to implement the strategy
3596773 we were extremely impressed with the high level of consultancy we received from glasshouse for this project glasshouse has been instrumental in changing how fife council manages its storage provision helping to make the council much more efficient
3596774 with our technology independence and experienced consultants we are able to focus on providing strategic plans to ensure that a companys it infrastructure is effective and scalable glasshouse is well positioned to identify the technology and services required that will deliver a more efficient and cost effective storage service provider model

3596847 if you look at mid century europe will be at 1990 levels of population while ours will be nearing 60 percent above 1990 levels so population does matter

3596849 we looked at the market landscape and found the nirvanix sdn was the only embeddable cloud storage platform capable of extending mystorango far far beyond mere remote backup and into feature rich media sharing and management right out of the home or office
3596850 we are very pleased with the testing and beta reception of mystorango and its potential to enhance the value of user data by enabling any authorized party to access organize share and protect their digital assets including music video digital libraries photographs business records and other confidential data from anywhere
3596851 the confluence of cloud storage and device storage in the home and office is a definite trend
3596852 endpoint devices can be lost or stolen storage arrays and local backup devices are susceptible to data corruption or catastrophic events such as fire or flood makers of these devices are beginning to understand the need to protect customer data off site we think that is a trend that will become increasingly common
3596853 silicon mountain has a vision of digital management both locally and remotely and sought the best way to make that vision a reality
3596854 by implementing the nirvanix sdn into their storage offerings they are best positioned to provide consumers and smbs with a great service with great functionality we are pleased to partner with silicon mountain and continue to work closely with them to develop a rich feature set of data management tools that will allow customers to do more with their data

3596857 the window of opportunity for us to accelerate orion has closed
3596858 it looks like we have reached some kind of stalemate which is threatening the whole dialogue
3596859 tsvangirai is moving goal posts forcing us to negotiate issues which we had already agreed upon
3596860 this is an issue that we had settled and he tsvangirai is also suggesting that he must be given full authority to appoint any new government

3596872 we can help students individually we cant bail out mefa

3596875 the brain trust didnt agree so ill do it again tomorrow
3596876 i didnt want my season to end on the doctors table
3596877 too much it was a bit depressing im sure as fans feel the way i do but its not for lack of effort its a great group of guys and were going to fight until the last day
3596878 the most important is the final tomorrow i knew that it was going to start fast i was concentrating on myself and at the end i was just ecstatic and now im elated
3596879 i hope that people werent too disappointed because really i was the most disappointed
3596880 but now i am satisfied that i swam the race just like i wanted
3596881 i would have liked to medal but i got my first personal best of the meet and i think thats a good effort
3596882 i cant be upset with that and im just moving on to the next heat
3596883 i dont feel any pressure to pick a date when it happens it happens
3596884 but at some point youve got to start narrowing it down you cant get three guys ready for your opening game
3596885 i say tavita but we are not talking about a huge difference
3596886 we feel like weve got three guys we believe we can win with and i know thats a luxury in college football these days
3596887 its helped him very much in terms of running the team all the little things like the new 40 second clock for example
3596888 its game experience he knows the speed of the game and that helps him
3596889 in the back of your mind you always know that football is a volatile game and i think its great that our team will have complete confidence that we have three quarterbacks who can play
3596890 get back to playing the way we did last year
3596891 we realized we still have a lot of work to do
3596892 ive got a little broken bone in there i dont even feel like i should even be out here practicing on it or even going into preseason
3596893 but its something that no one else seems to feel like its affecting everything so im out there practicing and playing the game
3596894 a lot of guys would hold themselves out of that period the goal line period with a cast on but he stepped right up
3596895 im employee no 23 so i do what im told
3596896 hes a warrior that makes me feel like if i have any knick knack injuries everybody has something bothering them
3596897 if hes pushing through it still catching interceptions with the half hand looking like the penguin then i can play through it
3596898 i wish we had more time the reality is i dont think were very good right now as a team
3596899 if we dont have our stuff right and our guys arent right well get run out of that stadium real quick
3596900 any coach is going to say that but i think were ready
3596901 i dont think a lot of guys are ready to do a lot of things in life but when they get thrown in the fire theyve to man up or b up
3596902 this is very consistent with household income and wage growth being strong
3596903 the potential for chinas domestic consumption is huge but it will be a long term process for china to wean its economy off exports and investment
3596904 the outlook for consumption growth in china is still uncertain
3596905 now would be a good time to save your game humans
3596906 we should accord to the real owners of the coco levy fund what is due them and this we can do by accounting for where the money has gone
3596907 velvet revolvers new album will draw heavily on their messy split with scott the band wanted a big name who could easily hold his own and reckon lenny is just the man for the job
3596908 i know and love the velvet revolver guys but there is no truth to the story about me joining their band
3596909 this war has pushed georgia further away not just from europe but also complicates the nato council in december
3596910 italy maintains that we cannot create an anti russia coalition in europe and on this point we are close to russian prime minister vladimir putins position
3596911 but this makes nato expansion much less likely the last thing the united states needs now is another front thats exactly what russia is taking advantage of
3596912 saakashvili is playing his media game for the conscience of the western world the price is high but he is very convincing
3596913 its dark out im sure you can think of a place
3596914 with petrol around 1 60 a litre it costs us about 70 to fill the tank and weve been getting about 900 kilometres from that without running empty
3596915 the guys over at tmr posted fuel consumption of 16
3596916 today we have a price situation whereby it is possible to introduce biodiesel in the country the biodiesel factories that have been built will now be able to operate and make a slim profit
3596917 if the price of cpo really comes down we will recommend to the government to introduce the use of biodiesel in our country particularly in the industrial and transport sectors the biodiesel plants can also make a bigger profit
3596918 we have always encouraged replanting of about five per cent of the total hectare but we have never achieved the five per cent at most is three per cent
3596919 if the cpo price continues to come down we will definitely give incentives for planters to replant

3596923 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months
3596924 its little bit different than lockers strain in terms of the location location complicates everything but you anticipate some time off and figure about day to day
3596925 walt is improving hes been a lot more consistent player when it comes to his blocking
3596926 hes looked pretty good and is doing some things there
3596927 walt has been a very good receiver the entire time hes been here
3596928 now hes showing signs of being better at all the other responsibilities of the tight end and obviously i think thats come with his experience
3596929 hes been there a while and hes starting to know things and understand things he still has some growth to go but i like the direction hes going
3596930 what we were looking forward to with shaw was just having some blinding speed out there curtis can run
3596931 some of our younger guys certainly bring that to us
3596932 theyre not as fast but maybe just a step behind curtis but i think what were really going to do is find that one person at that position that has athleticism to do special things
3596933 we say when you punt you win its a field position game
3596934 however many times we need to punt a game thats what im here for
3596935 ok so a couple of times we punted 9 10 times a game you know what if our offense needs it and i can help my defense out then thats what im going to do
3596936 my parents are pretty heavily involved in football right now
3596937 if you based anything on last year anything can happen at any time
3596938 if youre not getting reps or whatever youve just got to keep staying mentally in it somebody could go down at any time and youre in there
3596939 the current correction in reits is comparable to that of the more dramatic corrections of the past 35 years
3596940 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3596941 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3596942 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3596943 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3596944 i would have liked to medal but i got my first personal best of the meet and i think thats a good effort
3596945 i cant be upset with that and im just moving on to the next heat

3596952 this is your final warning sir if youre intent on testifying in favor of the bridge were going to have to write you up for abuse of a foreign fossil fuel
3596953 if the politicians wont do it its going to take community based policing each of us standing up to the oil pushers in our neighborhoods
3596954 we need to put an end to the lawless abuse of the climate and the illegal foreign wars before they prove the end of us
3596955 make no mistake about it this campaign was never about sen regola this campaign is about and always will be about the issues and how they relate to you
3596956 i have always intended to focus on the issues ive never intended to focus on anything else including personal problems
3596957 my focus on this campaign has been totally on the issues at hand and how those issues relate and impact the lives of voters and our constituents

3596961 after cavalera conspiracy i wanted to write a stronger uncompromised statement with soulfly what i did on this album is what i was aiming for this is the soulfly album that ive been trying to make for a long time
3596962 its definitely soulflys most battle ready record by far the vibe reminds me of movies like gladiator and 300 it comes from a completely different place
3596963 im excited to open the record with a fast song usually soulfly albums begin mid tempo but this reminds me of beneath the remains this song also has one of the biggest hooks ive ever done i can close my eyes and picture huge festival crowds singing it when the fast part comes in its just war
3596964 its the closest thing ive done to pantera dave put some killer lyrics to the music the fast part at the end is my favorite part on the album
3596965 his screaming on that song was off the wall to work with david was a trip the songs a full assault and it feels really natural its got that uncompromising attitude
3596966 usually album titles are inspired by something else like a movie
3596967 the first sketch the artist sent me was amazing it depicted this crazy guy with six arms holding six weapons each weapon represented one of our records when i got the image the word conquer just came to me
3596968 to me its not about conquering the world my statement on the record is conquering fear if you conquer your fear you conquer life and death youre truly free when you conquer your fear so thats why this name means so much
3596969 i like to mix cultures the other soulfly albums were more eastern european flavored sepultura was more brazilian egypt has a big chunk of influence on conquer we visited the city of the dead while we were in egypt its a cemetery where families still live near their dead that was crazy creepy and wild i didnt know the cairo trip was going to affect the album as much as it did
3596970 by the nile river there was this crazy gypsy band playing killer music
3596971 i happened to have my recorder so i recorded them and made an interlude out of their performance it felt so authentic to have that outro like old sepultura id rather the record sounds live than use a sound library from the internet that outro is subtle ive been making records for so long and i finally found the perfect balance between brutality and experimentation
3596972 honestly its a thank you to black sabbath for being black sabbath its slow doom metal
3596973 fedaya makes dark really heavy dub completely different from commercial dub he did the outro for touching the void and he played a lot of weird instruments those little things definitely make this song special when you listen to it
3596974 we could use the tools of the market to make a commercial record and sell more but i wouldnt be as happy inside i made the choice and we arent going down the easy road were going down the fucked up road but thats the road that we know
3596975 any of the eight guys could be on the podium i have to calm down go relax and get focused
3596976 queensland has the best solar resources in the world and it is a tragedy that the sunshine state isnt leading the way in renewable energy
3596977 were going to earn a billion dollars of coal royalties for the state this year the coal mines will continue and we will continue for some time to rely on coal based power industries

3596979 the garnaut report has made crystal clear the urgency of action on climate change
3596980 we will be joining with hundreds of other australians in using civil disobedience to prevent the coal trains transporting their greenhouse pollution
3596981 our action is not just for us and our children but for the millions around the world already suffering because of climate change
3596982 we can not keep burning coal and return to a safe climate
3596983 if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change we must urgently drive down our carbon emissions now
3596984 this will only be achieved if renewable power such as solar and geothermal replace dirty coal fired power plants like this one
3596985 queensland has the best solar resources in the world and it is a tragedy that the sunshine state isnt leading the way in renewable energy
3596986 if prime minister kevin rudd acts now australia could become a powerhouse for renewable energy manufacturing and technological development creating thousands of new jobs and investment opportunities
3596987 the suggestion that queensland could be a renewable energy powerhouse is spot on
3596988 the region has world class renewable resources especially in solar and the only reason you dont see companies investing heavily in the state is the lack of encouragement and the right legislative and regulatory environment from government
3596989 we do not see a pattern with regard to previous incidents
3596990 its undetermined as to what happened was mechanical or human
3596991 the recycling movement has created nearly one million new jobs in america alone if we dont continue contributing to the decline of our environment the need for recycling will decline leading to a drastic reduction in recycling related jobs in america the balance between improving the environment and keeping our economy strong is delicate we cannot ignore the need for americans to continue to litter and produce excess waste guaranteeing the need for recycling in the future

3597015 the price boom of the last five years may well have passed into history but so far the effect of its demise is to slow the number of transactions rather than cause a drop in prices
3597016 if a contest goes on for an extended period of time in the case of the superpower contest over three decades it would appear safe to conclude that the contestants had been evenly matched but we will probably never know for certain why the soviet fighter chose to take a dive in the fourth round because that certainly did not look like a proper knock out it is also hard to understand why the american fighter concluded his little victory jig by kneeing himself in the teeth or why he is now draped unconscious over the ropes and getting pummeled by some junior featherweights from the stands and why is the soviet fighter now seated back in his corner laughing it is never easy to give up the title of world superpower champion espeically when it is not being challenged but this is ridiculous what sort of sporting event is this anyway bring back the schoolgirl and the kangaroo
3597017 the goal of the american higher education system is not to educate the american higher education system succeeds brilliantly at one thing producing a subservient graduate who has no choice but to join the labor force on the terms dictated by her future corporate masters along with accepting the burden of educational debt the graduate makes a number of key concessions that financial success is more important than doing what you want that having a career is mroe important than family life and perhaps most importantly that failure is not an option the newly graduated dentist cannot afford to realize that rotten teeth really freak her out and that she should perhaps do some volunteer work unrelated to dentistry the need to repay the guaranteed student loans means that she must drill those teeth whether she wants to or not while heavily medicated if necessary
3597018 of all the cafes and restaurants that assol was crammed with the only one working was the cafe in the supermarket
3597019 its almost four times the amount of money theyre looking for in medicaid cuts
3597020 we think its one of the potential revenue streams that we need to look at instead of making cuts and raising taxes
3597021 its an infusion of dollars when we need it most
3597022 the medicaid cuts proposed by governor paterson demonstrate the urgent need for state fiscal relief
3597023 states are facing increasing demands and costs for programs such as medicaid while simultaneously attempting to balance already strained budgets
3597024 we feel that weve been under supported from the federal government on that for a long time
3597025 i dont think theres any ideology or grand legislative strategy behind it
3597026 helping move hundreds of millions of dollars out of our school bureaucracies and into city classrooms
3597027 this area is already at risk of toxic pollution and structural damage from the activities of the military a coal port will lead to the further destruction of this unique area the shoalwater region should be returned to its traditional owners to be managed
3597028 as premier bligh says this development is of significance to the state but for other reasons than profit of the coal industry if we lose shoalwater bay to industry and development we risk losing a significant site of natural heritage and contribute to the extinction of dugong and green sea turtles and the endemic species of flora found there
3597029 an opportunity exists for premier bligh to protect this important area from further development and enhance its protection as a national treasure and for future generations
3597030 we are deeply disappointed that the process thus far has in effect negated previous efforts to create a standard for community engagement in city development projects
3597031 simply put we will not allow the willets point model to become a precedent for future development projects in the city before this project proceeds to a doomed fate in the city council we strongly urge the administration to come to the table and work with us to address and resolve the issues of the willets point community
3597032 everyone agrees that property taxes are a problem but governor patersons proposed tax cap gimmick is the wrong answer they tried this scheme in california illinois and massachusetts and the consequences were devastating billions in education cuts overcrowded classrooms teachers fired and patersons plan wont even cut our property taxes tell david paterson hurting schools is the wrong answer
3597033 there is widespread recognition among new yorkers that runaway increases in property taxes are deeply hurting our state we cant ignore this reality as struggling residents continue to vote with their feet leaving our state to find tax relief elsewhere
3597034 i feel that its an office that needs more professionalism and integrity
3597035 being a register of probate is a job that affects peoples lives on a daily basis it affects families
3597036 on the democratic side if somebody decides to run they have to beat buonomo who is on the ballot
3597037 i assume gov patrick would want to fill it fast
3597038 the register of probate makes sure everything runs properly from my perspective i think hes done a decent job but the chips are going to have to fall where they may
3597039 you look at a tv screen and you really dont have any depth of field

3597045 oh my its amazing i mean im really stunned by this picture
3597046 what was the first thing you saw when you opened your eyes
3597047 there was no veil over the left eye anymore i saw color
3597048 if we were to adopt these policies today the results would be chaos there would be pandemonium mass hysteria a disaster of biblical proportions as the anti christ is summoned to try for world domination
3597049 if we were to adopt your policy today without changing anything else the consequences would be disasterous
3597050 i can think of an instance in which a wall should be required
3597051 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
3597052 basically they said there were break ins on the eastern side of monroe
3597053 i wasnt expecting it it was kind of a surprise
3597054 im surprised because it has been such a nice area for so long
3597055 it makes me feel as if were threatened it could happen it could happen to anybody

3597067 apparently the contractor has no sense of urgency to complete this project in a timely manner
3597068 at this slow rate i doubt if this work will be completed this year it should not take two years to widen a two mile section of street causing a very hazardous traffic situation on busy north oak trafficway

3597071 if we want to implement the goals of the cbd and safeguard the natural basis of life for future generation it is indispensable to involve all spheres of society and in particular businesses
3597072 the parties to the cbd are fast becoming the worlds largest organization dedicated to opposing equitable social change with industry playing an increasingly larger role in commodifying the planets environmental resources
3597073 many of the parties are lining up for their slice of the cake
3597074 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules

3597110 son i sense that you feel your options in life are limited and that you have to enlist in order to pay for college but i guarantee you that there are
3597111 daughter i know youve already enlisted but there is still time you can still
3597112 son it is remarkable that you have expressed your willingness to die for your countrys causes but have you considered enlisting in a federal law that would prohibit me from discouraging you to join the army but i am willing to face being arrested if it will help you to think again about this decision
3597113 this is the missing piece of the puzzle to meet the growing needs of patients who require specialized care and to provide support for their families especially during the closing chapter of their lives

3597115 if were not where we want to be then were going to work at it
3597116 climate change is one of the great global challenges of our time
3597117 the leaders of the worlds major economies both developed and developing commit to combat climate change in accordance with common but differentiated responsibilities
3597118 this whole initiative has been a wild goose chase and hasnt brought anything constructive to the un talks
3597119 our approach continues to be to give them all kinds of incentives we hope we will be able to convince these two important players china and india to embrace this approach
3597120 will give us greater confidence and commitments as we go to next year
3597121 developed countries should make explicit commitments to continue to take the lead in emissions reduction
3597122 from the outset climate camp organisers have indicated that the actions they will take part in will be peaceful and will ensure the safety of both coal workers and participants in the actions it is an extreme overreaction of the police to deploy the riot squad water police dog squad and mounted police the real criminals in this scenario are the coal companies and the nsw government who are enabling the coal companies to continue fuelling climate change through coal exports

3597142 i think the presidents going to have to take military action do in western pakistan and musharraf can say hey they didnt tell me
3597143 but now some of them are campaigning for intervention in pakistan to fight the islamic extremism bush policy itself daily fosters
3597144 for all this we have to thank george w bush was his administration unaware of the fact that islamist militants driven from afghanistan would receive a welcome across the border
3597145 im inclined to think bush may have really thought he could get away with his invasion of afghanistan and then iraq without producing all this blowback
3597146 did bush or the neocons surrounding him and whispering in his ears expect that the entire afghan people would be grateful for the u
3597147 gli italiani chiedono sicurezza economica e non solo e berlusconi gliela sta fornendo con il suo pugno di ferro in un guanto di velluto
3597148 nei suoi primi 100 giorni di mandato silvio berlusconi potrebbe essere riuscito a fare limpossibile garantirsi il controllo di una nazione apparentemente ingovernabile a un livello senza precedenti nella recente storia italiana
3597149 sorprendente che qualcuno in italia sia riuscito ad avere tanto successo si legge nella corrispondenza dallitalia molto pi della maggior parte dei paesi europei litalia stata a lungo tormentata dalla corruzione e da un sistema che tributa un eccessivo peso politico ai partiti piccoli
3597150 diese ordnung beruhte auf prinzipien dass grenzen unverletzlich sind und kleine staaten dieselben rechte haben wie gro e jetzt aber sehen wir russland und ministerpr sident putin genau diese prinzipien untergraben wir sehen eine politik der umverteilung die aus dem 19 jahrhundert stammt nach dem motto wir sind zur ck auf der b hne wir zeigen euch wie stark wir sind und weil wir so stark sind m ssen wir mehr bekommen als andere georgien ist nur der anfang morgen ist es die ukraine dann die baltischen staaten
3597151 the protests are the manifestation of an anger that the peace process doesnt seem to have achieved anything
3597152 the peace process has not addressed the concerns of kashmiris they want to see an end to uncertainty they want a resolution of the kashmir dispute
3597153 the protests are serious and should serve as a wake up call
3597154 firing on protesters speaks of indian double standards in jammu three protesters were killed during several days of curfew but in the muslim kashmir valley six people are martyred on the very first day of a curfew
3597155 after these shooting incidents we have lost whatever love we had for indians
3597156 the rising pro freedom protests will definitely give impetus to the freedom struggle
3597157 what we are seeing is the revival of the separatist movement in kashmir which had been in a dying stage
3597158 firing on unarmed civilians will alienate people further and serve the cause of separatists
3597159 it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad

3597190 ik heb me de laatste jaren genoeg door filippo magnini laten afzeiken dit is mijn antwoord
3597191 hij wilde de afgelopen twee jaar nooit naar feestjes verjaardagen en andere partijtjes wie zich afvraagt waarom dat was heeft nu het antwoord
3597192 vooraf is hij niet genoemd als favoriet gelukkig gaat het er in de sport om dat je achteraf genoemd moet worden als winnaar
3597193 dat wereldrecord van sullivan in de baan naast me niets van meegekregen ik had het te druk met mezelf
3597194 de 100 vrij is een gevecht over drie ronden en niemand kan zo knokken als pieter
3597195 geen mens zwemt de tweede 50 meter sneller dan pieter zoals hij zijn race indeelt is hij groot geworden hij zwemt als popov en biondi vroeger old school
3597196 dit is ook een brabants record en niet te vergeten een clubrecord
3597197 hij geniet hier in peking met volle teugen hij lijkt wel een debutant
3597198 atlanta sydney athene ik zie hier in peking niemand meer die er toen ook bij was in de finale van de 100 vrij alleen ik zei de gek
3597199 hij heeft er altijd gestaan op de momenten dat niemand het voor mogelijk hield was alexander popov tijdens de ek van 1999 in istanboel ook niet onverslaanbaar en gold voor thorpe in sydney op de 200 vrij niet hetzelfde
3597200 dit was zijn beste race ooit hij krijgt nog n kans voor zijn llerbeste race
3597201 een wereldrecord in de halve finales telt niet daar win je op het einde geen medailles mee
3597202 ik wist dat ik vandaag in de halve finales hard moest zwemmen om de finale te bereiken dat heb ik gedaan
3597203 my philosophy is that profit is the natural result of doing whats right for your patients
3597204 this message is to alert dentists to what for many could be a major slow down in dentistry
3597205 the dental boom we have all participated in for the last eight years is coming to an end
3597206 first there are still a lot of myths about dental marketing on the internet that need to be dispelled
3597207 second the internet is the one place you can still generate high quality new patients quickly and at a reasonable cost
3597208 our only hope is that they will help you to weather the turbulence of the coming months
3597209 we were willing to try anything really wed both always wanted children
3597210 its overwhelming im still staring at her now thinking wow shes ours its actually happened for us
3597211 i hope that if anybody going through treatment sees us and sees evie it gives them one last little bit of hope to go for it
3597212 its been a real emotional rollercoaster theres been ups and downs but you get through it and to have evie now you forget what you went through it makes it all worthwhile
3597213 the first published study on babies born from vitrification shows no adverse effects of the technique and there are no implications to evies health as a result of the vitrification process
3597214 its been a rollercoaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident

3597237 in 06 and 07 they were marginalized by the investment banks
3597238 we figured if thats what it took to compete we were going to let them go

3597365 ik deed dat zonder nadenken ik had niet eens een stok of zo bij me ik stampte dat beest enkele keren hard maar brak daarbij mijn teen

3597384 dus wat doe je dan als je een baby van elf maanden hebt vertrekken natuurlijk ook al was het voor mijn man verschrikkelijk hij wilde zijn vrienden en familie niet achterlaten maar door in georgi te blijven helpen we hen niet dat besefte garri ook vanuit belgi kunnen we nog geld en spulletjes opsturen
3597385 we wilden dora laten zien aan garris vrienden en familie
3597386 we logeerden met vrienden in een huisje in de bergen en waren van de buitenwereld afgesneden maar dat er wat aan de hand was dat wisten we wel onderweg naar de bergen waren we tanks en soldaten gepasseerd en s nachts zagen we lichtflitsen in het donker

3597391 the protests are the manifestation of an anger that the peace process doesnt seem to have achieved anything
3597392 the peace process has not addressed the concerns of kashmiris they want to see an end to uncertainty they want a resolution of the kashmir dispute

3597422 the proposal was drafted largely by attorneys in the general counsels offices of the commerce departments national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the interior department according to a source with the national marine fisheries service the two agencies experts were not consulted until last week the official said in 2003 the administration imposed similar rules that would have allowed agencies to approve new pesticides and projects to reduce wildfire risks without asking the opinion of government scientists about whether threatened or endangered species and habitats might be affected the pesticide rule was later overturned in court the interior department along with the forest service is currently being sued over the rule governing wildfire prevention but internal reviews by the national marine fisheries service and fish and wildlife service concluded that about half the unilateral evaluations by the forest service and bureau of land management that determined wildfire prevention projects were unlikely to harm protected species were not legally or scientifically valid those had been permitted under the 2003 rule changes

3597440 cyberbullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
3597441 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
3597442 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
3597443 moreover the vehicle for the cyberbullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000

3597450 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
3597451 because of ethnic cleansing conducted in georgia by russia from 1993 to 2008
3597452 we can then look to the issue of how to resolve the longstanding frozen conflicts of south ossetia and abkhazia

3597460 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
3597461 we want the eu to acknowledge the aggression by russia
3597462 we have to discuss and revise our negotiations because russias actions constitute a clear violation of international law and the united nations charter and such actions should have consequences
3597463 central and eastern european countries might like to take the opportunity to take a swipe at the russians as one would expect
3597464 they may put these things forward but i would not necessarily say thats going to be the outcome
3597465 appears to be to damage georgia militarily and economically to such an extent that its capacity to resist politically is severely weakened
3597466 south ossetians supported by russians are committing horrible massacres in georgian villages
3597467 i said i have to do something to document this

3597535 as long as you keep performing and keep making plays youll be hard for them to replace
3597536 there are certain times in the season and certain times during games when adversity hits youve got to know how to react to that veteran players know what it takes to get the job done

3597539 to me its an opportunity to mentor some young guys
3597540 ive been in the game a long time and seen it all these guys are like sponges coming into the league theyve asked a lot of questions theyre willing to listen and theyve got a lot to learn
3597541 youve got to look after the young guys like some of the veterans once looked after me thats just the right thing to do as a football player and as a person

3597587 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive

3597601 theyre great for their intended uses but theyre not for everyone
3597602 we decided we wanted to start a family and needed more home space in 2001 they had just started building extremely affordable homes in the new port richey area now known as trinity marcus is a golf fanatic and had played golf at the fox hollow golf club and noticed that the homes were beautiful and affordable the combination of affordability newness and the ability to walk to the golf course were the prime reasons we moved to trinity
3597603 we knew this place was going to boom at first there was nothing here and then everything started to fill new stores new attractions
3597604 when youre buying the house and you dont have any kids youre not thinking about kids this house didnt have much of a yard but was right next to a conservation area with a little pond and we thought who cares we dont need a backyard we have a pool
3597605 literally they would sit on the bank in the grass and ive walked that close to them to take pictures
3597606 when hgtv contacted us i think they were just shopping the area
3597607 i think they found our real estate web site thats how they first contacted us then they asked if we had any clients who were buying and selling within the next couple of months
3597608 joe gibbons called and asked if we would be interested in being on this show i was like me miss dramatic of course im interested
3597609 needless to say we did the video immediately and i federal expressed it back to them and they called the very next day and in about three days we were booked to be on the show
3597610 they said we definitely would love to have you on our show when can we come out there
3597611 they shot our house and the three we had narrowed the search to and they shoot every room in every house so its a lot of work
3597612 i was a little hesitant only in the fact that at work i was really busy and didnt want to miss that many days which totaled five by the end of filming
3597613 in the end this was a once in a lifetime opportunity so how could we even think about passing this up plus my wife would disown me
3597614 we dont have family in florida all of our family is in the northeast and midwest
3597615 its so supportive we can all hang out together were two minutes from each other our kids play and we can have adult conversation if i have to go somewhere we can drop the kids off and they can do the same
3597616 its hard when you dont have grandma you have to pick and choose your friends wisely and then rely on them to be you family because you dont have anybody else and thats happened here
3597617 when i went to east lake woodlands it just didnt feel right
3597618 i just had to believe that wed find something in trinity im one of those people that go with my gut
3597619 trinity is an awesome growing community with everything to offer within the community shopping dining schools parks and soon a new town center and hospital
3597620 we feel extremely blessed being able to live in such a wonderful home we call it paradise and in a neighborhood that our children even when they get older and become parents will always call home
3597621 obviously i was nervous at first because we were actually acting
3597622 once i got the feel for what the producer wanted then acting became natural it was an unbelievable experience and i would do it again
3597623 the program features a behind the scenes look at the home buying and selling experience from the homeowners perspective viewers follow the search and learn what to look for and decide whether or not a home is meant for them
3597624 everybody wants to know what it was like penelope had less facial hair than a guy so it was certainly more pleasant it was better than kissing jonathan rhys meyers in match point

3597631 mendis has really bowled well in the tests and his confidence must be sky high along with muralitharan they form a very potent attack but he is not unplayable and we are working on a gameplan to counter him during the one day series
3597632 we will try and play our natural game against him and see how it goes he does not bowl at 150 kmph so there is no reason to be frightened of him when murali was new to international cricket even he bothered many top batsmen and is still bothering them but with time batsmen learn more and adjust to the situations

3597660 i think we want to put cameras where we see the majority of crimes taking place
3597661 did not expect the tremendous amount of responsiveness and action they received from our company
3597662 i would disagree with dropping the case because for the entire year mr cohen knew of those violations
3597663 is not unusual because the city is interested in violations being cured and the property being brought into compliance with applicable codes
3597664 ive always been and will continue to be committed to improving south oakland and the city of pittsburgh
3597665 i believe dropping the case is the citys way of saying they now realize that
3597666 i think judge ricciardi was wise to issue a fine that large
3597667 i have no problem with the fine being waived for any landlord that gets their building into compliance
3597668 there were things that were broken when i moved in that were still broken when i left
3597669 i dont like living in places like that and it seemed like a lot of the places around pittsburgh are like that
3597670 i hope that this investigation makes steady progress and leads to the quick return of the victims to japan
3597671 the agreement would fall apart in the case japan violates the agreement and does not act as demanded under the agreement
3597672 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humour would come from
3597673 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3597674 we feel that the use of the word retard throughout the film 15 or more times is done without any regard for the dignity of people with intellectual disabilities
3597675 its not romneys religion that we are opposed to but his lack of character
3597676 a small group of us met to discuss the forum and we were unanimous that it should have been allowed to proceed there are valid reasons for such a forum
3597677 as was emphasised to us by international islamic university constitutional law expert dr abdul aziz bari and hanifah maidin the head of pas legal bureau article 121 1a of the federal constitution when passed had not envisaged the circumstances that could arise for example the impact on people of other faiths embracing islam
3597678 we dont see the forum as non muslims encroaching into theological matters the underpinning reason was for the legal technical and procedural lacuna created by article 121 1a to be ironed out in earnestness and intellectual integrity
3597679 take the case of subashini and saravanan who were married under civil law and he later on embraced islam
3597680 if the non converting spouse does not use the law reform marriage and divorce act to dissolve the marriage what happens these are long standing issues that the authorities should have ironed out long ago instead every time a case like this raises its ugly head it is muslims and islam that get bashed
3597681 sebagai orang islam kita perlu bersikap adil memberi penjelasan kepada mereka isu timbul apabila penjelasan itu timbul daripada pihak yang tidak layak seperti sisters in islam
3597682 jadi bagaimana mereka akan dapat penjelasan yang sebenarnya tentang islam
3597683 jadi dengan kerangka undang undang yang telah termaktub dalam perkara 121 1a dalam perlembagaan persekutuan itu berkaitan bidangkuasa mahkamah syariah kenapa pihak pihak yang berkenaan perlu mengadakan perbahasan terbuka yang mempersoal bidangkuasa ini
3597684 jika tidak perbahasan terbuka itu dilihat bertujuan untuk mengkritik undang undang islam dan memaksakan udang undang sivil mendominasi undang undang islam apakah pihak penganjur forum itu boleh berfikir mereka mempunyai tujuan lain dan ia boleh dipercayai oleh umat islam

3597793 people envision the typical format of a winery to be rolling vineyards and a grand tasting room
3597794 but this is a new model thats part of a developing urban winemaking trail you see it happening especially in the san francisco bay area where there are now a number of in town wineries their distance from the vineyards in napa and sonoma is about the same as ours is from the north fork

3597796 i stumbled on an ad for a tasting room person at rivendell winery in the hudson valley

3597835 believing in god yes is innocuous but believing in a god via a religion that trains its followers to devalue reason is a recipe for destruction for everyone
3597836 in order to be certain that foo you have to possess a godlike mental capacity the ability to be 100 certain a human cant be 100 certain about anything our brains arent that reliable therefore to be a true believer in foo you have to believe you are god

3597851 mr adams posts maybe occasionally flawed but at least they arent filled with the perverse pleasure of pointing out the flaws in others

3597861 someone responded to that with a comment that what adams was doing was called trolling
3597862 in fact christians dont as much talk smack about you as much as pray for you to evenutally accept god
3597863 how about trying ever once in awile to not bash everyone elses religeon

3597909 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3597910 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3597911 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3597912 well nancy right or wrong the world gymnastics federation has implemented a minimum age restriction
3597913 just saw her performing on the olympics and i just loved the song that she used on the floor can anyone tell me what was that song
3597914 and also why should a 12 year old be better than a 16 year old
3597915 five years ago most of our buyers were americans from the east coast with some europeans thrown in now there are as many chinese buyers as there are americans
3597916 many of them dont speak a word of english but theyre here bidding on works that they want to bring back to china
3597917 in an auction earlier this year i saw carvings with estimates of 1 000 sell for 15 000
3597918 the wealthy in china were buying these figurines to give as gifts to friends and visiting dignitaries during the olympics its a very interesting development
3597919 we sell a lot of tang pottery but ive never seen anything like these camels
3597920 their size and level of detail is unique and camels from this period are usually prancing or upright
3597921 these camels suggest the person they were buried with was very important
3597922 in true hollywood style with lots of action and magic
3597923 i always believe you work hard and you play hard and i think this will inspire everyone to work hard
3597924 i will not go on vacation i will not leave the state i will not do anything until i have a budget
3597925 they have been very busy working on hundreds of different bills that have nothing to do with the budget
3597926 if the governor feels like he can go to the border governors conference and still negotiate the budget then go ahead
3597927 i think the reason the governor is frustrated is because he actually has to sit in the building and figure it out with us
3597928 the more hes out of the capital or out of the state the more his critics can say look arnold is traveling all over while california workers are being asked to take a huge pay cut
3597929 meine gro mutter 81 jahre hat ende juni ein schreiben vom lotto team k ln erhalten in dem bedauert wird dass sie nicht an diesem system teilnehmen m chte und ihr auftrag zum 01 08 08 storniert wird sie hat nie einen auftrag erteilt jedoch hat sie gestern 15 07 08 auf ihrem kontoauszug eine lastschrift zugunsten der lotto team gmbh in h he von 52 50 entdeckt sie hat nun bei ihrer hausbank die r ckbuchung per widerruf verlangt und wird bei der kripo anzeige erstatten
3597930 ich bekam vor zwei tagen einen anruf von diesem lotto team und war echt geschockt die hatten meine bankdaten und angeblich sogar meine unterschrift wodurch ich zugesagt h tte von september an lotto zu spielen dabei hab ich weder meine bankdaten angegeben noch irgendetwas unterschrieben ich hab in meinem ganzen leben noch nie lotto gespielt als ich diesen typen fragte woher er meine daten hat hat er nur rumgestammelt und gefragt ob er mich k ndigen soll aus diesem spiel dazu m sste er mir die gesch ftsbedingungen vorlesen ich hab mir dann sowohl seinen namen als auch die gesch ftsadresse geben lassen ich bin echt stinksauer sollten die es wagen von mir etwas abzubuchen setzt es ne anzeige
3597931 it paralyzed him for a little bit but hes walking around pretty good now thats good news thats the only good news we got tonight
3597932 the things that first attracted me to john are things that i think are what attract him to the american people
3597933 as i write this russia is waging war on my country
3597934 we had a major breakthrough in the lowlands with the significant discovery and announced appraisal programs by our partners although eclipsed by these developments we also had excellent results on our entire portfolio during the second quarter of this year financially the improved oil weighting and higher commodity prices translated into cash flow of 5 14 million for the quarter
3597935 we just tried 12th streets brunch for the first time today and it was a great experience
3597936 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3597937 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3597938 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3597939 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3597940 i would have liked to medal but i got my first personal best of the meet and i think thats a good effort
3597941 i cant be upset with that and im just moving on to the next heat
3597942 last night i discovered a new new york favorite in park blue
3597943 lo que quiero plantear en la pel cula no es tan s lo lo que los artistas de reguet n queremos exponer sino expresar las vivencias del pa s as que entiendo que todo el mundo debe identificarse con la pel cula porque son sucesos reales que cualquier joven pudiera enfrentar en la calle
3597944 y quiero aclarar que no es apta para ni os es una pel cula en la que estamos apelando al p blico mayor de 18 a os un joven mayor va a entender el concepto de la pel cula y si alg n ni o la ve es necesario que sus padres le especifiquen que es una pel cula que esto es actuaci n que es un papel que obviamente no es daddy yankee sino un papel
3597945 est duro le tengo un respeto grande a los actores y productores de cine que s que se sacrifican mucho para hacer una pel cula lo hice por apoyar el talento de mi tierra y apoyar el mercado del cine de puerto rico en donde est n pasando cosas muy buenas
3597946 sta es una pel cula independiente pero me siento muy agradecido con dios de que haya podido salir a un nivel bien competitivo
3597947 estoy claro que es imparable me gustar a tener una gran soluci n para eso pero estoy claro que no la hay s lo tienes que moverte con mucha tenacidad si no te comen vivo
3597948 es una propuesta completa en m sica soy un hombre de evoluci n y he incluido a los capitanes de la nueva escuela que son randy y arc ngel los respeto musicalmente hablando quise hacer un disco totalmente en espa ol y como es talento de barrio quise utilizar la m sica de la calle que aunque no tenga exposici n en la radio tiene xito en el barrio porque hay dos mercados est el mercado popular y el mercado de la calle

3597954 wow i feel like im going to pass out i should probably get a taxi home
3597955 giving a manicure here is a bit of a joke since you also get a free drink thrown in obviously the manicures arent going to be that well done
3597956 after a couple of days of bagels amp cream cheese we decided it was time for some
3597957 hey thats the seinfeld diner ill go there for lunch
3597958 i have yet to wait on a line at this grocery and the girls at the register are always so quick and pleasant
3597959 our symbol o is about much more than barack obama its a symbol of unity hope solidarity and an end to the divisiveness that has plagued this country for too long it is the peace sign of our generation a sign for those who are tired of the fear the hatred the greed and the ignorance

3597965 o futebol do esp rito santo tem potencial para se reerguer tanto que sempre foi um estado que revelou jogadores
3597966 making lasting impressions upon the students are the result of life long learning

3597969 we have until friday midnight to come to terms with all of our picks and we hope to do that with several key players
3597970 we are extremely pleased with the progress and pace of construction
3597971 they want to see the kid throw a perfect game
3597972 he got us deep into the game but he wasnt as sharp as hed been
3597973 honestly i didnt think too much about that or look around or anything like that i was just focused on pitching
3597974 our thought was that we needed to get to him early
3597975 i didnt think so and then i saw it on the video and it looked like it was heading right down into the mitt
3597976 best play ive ever made in the big leagues yes
3597977 with the way weve been playing i was not going to let that ball get past me
3597978 its going to take some time for all of our new guys to get comfortable
3597979 but im happy with what theyve done so far and i think the futures bright for all of them
3597980 for this volume we combed through the books of twelve ancient authors to find 44 significant excerpts concerning alexander the great we then arranged the excerpts chronologically and provided the text and citation for each
3597981 ive been shooting since a very young age probably two or three years old hunting and shooting with my dad
3597982 i harvested my first moose when i was 18 a couple of years ago
3597983 it wasnt a huge trophy moose but it was a trophy to me i was able to go hunting with my dad and he was there when i shot it
3597984 i grew up hunting and fishing with my dad and that did involve moose hunting back in alaska
3597985 i definitely think my hunting background and my growing up in alaska helped me progress so quickly and make this team after only shooting international trap for just two years
3597986 its been a roller coaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident
3597987 ever since i was a little boy i wanted to be in the world series that hasnt happened to me yet when i go to boston i feel like theres a legitimate chance for that to happen this year
3597988 theyre trying hard to win theres only so much you can do theyre not supermen
3597989 we set our price where we think it was fair given all considerations of the various issues
3597990 nine inch by thirteen inch and twelve inch by eighteen inch masonite boards
3597991 eight screws to fix the rods on to each board
3597992 four two and half inch long pin rods which would be used to attaching to boards along with screws for fixing it
3597993 star tips of sizes 14 16 and for the tires size 22
3597994 one nine inches by thirteen inches piece to form the bottom
3597995 one wedge formed to assemble on the nine inches by eight inches piece towards the front of the piece
3597996 ich wei wie es am n chsten tag weiter geht ob ich gut fahre oder schlecht fahre das wird mich nicht in meinen grundfesten ersch ttern und ist kein beinbruch
3597997 es ist keine schande wenn man im star 13 wird aber ich habe mir gedacht 13 ist doch ein bisschen z h und vielleicht geht da noch was
3597998 das ist wie im sterreichischen fu ball und der champions league das ist schon nicht ganz so einfach gut dass wir uns gefunden haben
3597999 dann hatten wir auch im segelbereich noch ideen die wir getestet haben die sachen sind alle eingeschlagen wir haben eine gute basis geschaffen um einen guten wettkampf zu segeln ich habe das gef hl das boot f hrt gut das stimmt mich positiv und ich habe mich selten in meiner segelkarriere get uscht wenn ich so ein gef hl hatte haben wir immer einen guten wettkampf gehabt wir k nnen eine absolute topleistung bringen
3598000 ich kann auch gut mit einer niederlage umgehen wenn ich mein bestes gebracht habe und die anderen waren besser das geh rt im sportlerleben dazu ich w nsche mir dass ich meine leistung bringen kann und auch der christian und dass wir eine gute teamleistung bringen und dann ist einiges drinnen
3598001 ich will am ende des wettkampfes sagen es hat alles gepasst
3598002 for a long time my five children and i have not eaten anything except dry bread with tea with out sugar because we dont have enough income to buy food for us the only person that supports the whole family is my 14 year old son that sells vegetables on his cart every day he is disturbed by the municipality police and he is moved from one place to another place and whatever he got he has to give half of his income to be able to sell from the cart so the income his income is very less and we are fighting with this bad situation to be alive
3598003 god bless ail who really helped me a lot there are no words mention for what they did for me
3598004 why is it that every time i think i know the answers someone goes and changes the questions
3598005 peter please im an x man i dont shoot people im just trying to make a point
3598006 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3598007 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3598008 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3598009 i think everybody knows that we have to hopefully win all three
3598010 at this point of the year we need more than to gain one game in this series
3598011 will that be a direct correlation to helping the industry and the economy i dont know
3598012 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3598013 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3598014 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3598015 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3598016 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3598017 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3598018 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3598019 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3598020 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3598021 conhece perfeitamente o programa faz parte dele e talvez esteja exagerando um pouco
3598022 the unprecedented performance of the ati radeon hd 4870 x2 is a perfect match for the alienware area 51 area 51 alx and aurora desktops
3598023 alienware users are going to love having this much power at their fingertips
3598024 something is going to be built on this site theres a lot of pressure on the site
3598025 we have had a string of owners like this who have let it go downhill
3598026 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3598027 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3598028 what is at stake here is nothing less than the integrity of the petition gathering process
3598029 referendum leaders have a moral and legal obligation to ensure that those who work for them are properly trained fully transparent and truthful in all their representations to signers
3598030 we dont know that thats true we have nothing thats been produced to use in evidence so far
3598031 they told everybody if they signed the petition they could keep their jobs and they give everybody a dollar
3598032 i think they take advantage of the people here i really do
3598033 theyre being asked to sign something without even being able to read it
3598034 its a crime as far as i look at it
3598035 if something was said incorrectly let the circulators name be obtained and we will take swift action to investigate and remove that employee if necessary
3598036 we want to insure that ohioans are informed that their financial choices could be taken away and in the process 6 000 good paying jobs with benefits will also be taken away
3598037 accurate census counts and population estimates are vitally important because they ensure cities get their fair share of state and federal funding
3598038 mayor mallory will provide the leadership that we need to ensure that cities partner with the census bureau to achieve the most accurate count possible
3598039 the warwick denver hotel family feels honored to have such a distinguished individual working as part of our team sydney brings a great deal of knowledge and expertise as well as a positive encouraging personality to our management team at the hotel
3598040 thank you god for restoring my faith in politics and politicians
3598041 i listened to my constituents ive been getting five to ten calls every day plus e mail
3598042 theres nothing worse than trying to make that kind of a decision for 100 000 people
3598043 its foolish for a city the size of west jordan the fourth largest city in the state to plan one year at a time were never going to catch up
3598044 the thing is like many games you need to ignore the grognards because they love the game so much they kill it and nail it down under a nice piece of glass where it can stay pristine and untouched
3598045 canon is whats been established until a better idea comes along
3598046 in america anybody may become president and i suppose its just one of the risks you take

3598053 angesichts des schleichenden substanzverzehrs im deutschen fernstra ennetz bitter n tig
3598054 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3598055 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3598056 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3598057 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3598058 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3598059 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3598060 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3598061 random acts of fuckery david banner voice of the people edition
3598062 if we get to a four degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase
3598063 i hope that this investigation makes steady progress and leads to the quick return of the victims to japan
3598064 the agreement would fall apart in the case japan violates the agreement and does not act as demanded under the agreement

3598069 the israeli siege has turned gaza into a big prison
3598070 the collective punishment of the population of gaza which has been instituted for months now has failed
3598071 if youve got any heart drop them off they are like gold medals to us
3598072 you cant sell them they are a personal thing youre not going to get no money
3598073 i opened the door and he pushed me from behind
3598074 i said why are you doing this what do you want
3598075 its been a hard 18 months this is the last thing my mum needs

3598078 the new series is in the very early stages of development and will encompass storylines in both sydney and melbourne a nine network spokeswoman said

3598080 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
3598081 whatever mistakes tblisi has made they cannot justify russias actions
3598082 moscow has invaded a neighbor an illegal act of aggression that violates the u n charter and fundamental principles of cooperation and security in europe
3598083 beginning a well planned war as the olympics were opening violates the ancient tradition of a truce to conflict during the games
3598084 reserva para resolver n o adianta entrar em campo para atrapalhar
3598085 estou entrando para isso resolver e vai ser assim at quando eu conseguir ser titular foi uma pena sofrer o gol de empate no final da partida mas o evando pegou bem na bola
3598086 conquistamos um belo resultado foi um bom teste para os meninos que estrearam logo em um jogo eletrizante
3598087 conquistamos um belo resultado foi um bom teste para os meninos que estrearam pelo s o paulo logo em um jogo eletrizante com as duas equipes buscando a vit ria
3598088 o 0 a 0 est de bom tamanho para a gente passar de fase no morumbi
3598089 s precisamos lembrar de ter aten o com os ataques do atl tico para n o tomar gols em casa mas foi um grande resultado
3598090 em termos de resultado o empate foi bom mas a equipe deixou a desejar tecnicamente n o podemos nos empolgar tanto
3598091 fomos bem defensivamente mas faltou qualidade do meio para frente vamos com calma com esses jogadores que precisam de um pouquinho mais de tempo
3598092 if these kinds of operations continue against us in swat and in the tribal areas we will continue this

3598096 alcancei tr s grandes objetivos ouro recorde mundial e baixar dos 1min55
3598097 i think people are overreacting a great deal about this but what can i do
3598098 i sold most of my stuff on the way up and thats my style
3598099 people that understand and know my strategy very well would not be surprised to hear that because my strategy is always to put the most money in my best idea in terms of risk reward today
3598100 they are having a field day i hope the short sellers enjoy themselves because this is very short term thinking
3598101 it is an old very wise thing that in commodity markets you shouldnt be short its dangerous
3598102 clearly our production will vary from month to month but we are targeting to ship 2 000 metric tons in 2008
3598103 so far management has been unable to provide evidence that high production volume in the 1 000 tonnes range can be achieved concomitant with high purity and low cost
3598104 weve been under such scrutiny i was afraid it might have gotten into the wrong hands
3598105 we took a short term hit for the long term health of the business
3598106 id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3598107 im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3598108 shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling
3598109 i think it is more urban im writing every day right here at the piano in this living room this is my best work ever
3598110 god has a way of taking something bad and turning it into something good
3598111 she was expected to win the gold medal so it is very disappointing
3598112 there is no way that those horses got out of that pen without human hands picking up that gate
3598113 i thought there was car accident i heard hoofs on pavement
3598114 the vet came out and pulled a big chunk of bone out of the back of her leg
3598115 i cant tell someone that just registering and voting is going to change their life
3598116 the system itself is broken due to the creation of safe districts for incumbent legislators we have the least competitive legislative races in the nation with most seats being uncontested and the sad reality is that 98 percent of the candidates who spend the most money are the ones who win
3598117 we need to build a base of support a movement for social justice that politicians will have to respect
3598118 we are registering people to vote not to support a particular candidate but to become part of the movement that will have the power to actualize our values
3598119 what always horrifies me is that no matter what side of the political spectrum youre on there is a relatively small number of people who actually elect our public servants
3598120 der er en tekst den er blevet accepteret i moskva og den er blevet accepteret her i georgien jeg har tilsagn fra alle hovedpersonerne

3598123 this is a potentially very difficult at best condition it places us in
3598124 the governor thinks its a really bizarre way to make policy to say german tourists are more important than states schoolchildren
3598125 this is a consequence of a failed energy policy in this country
3598126 i am sitting here scratching my head what in the world were they thinking in that board meeting
3598127 there were times when i was doing jack when i actually felt retarded like really retarded
3598128 every day i see athletes make great achievements i see them on the field and in society contributing for this to happen its a slap in our faces
3598129 its demeaning and degrading to a group of people who dont deserve it
3598130 its taking a group of people and putting them in a negative connotation
3598131 its a hurtful word and its a painful word for parents and relatives
3598132 if stiller thinks its cool then a bunch of high school kids will think thats cool
3598133 this is pretty remarkable to see a three fold increase in one year
3598134 if youre going to take advantage of senior citizens were going to lock you up
3598135 if it sounds too good to be true it is
3598136 im actually leaning toward running im getting a lot of encouragement it definitely is something i think about
3598137 you have to be able to raise a considerable amount of money
3598138 at one point one of them came around the counter placed the owner or operator in a headlock pulled a gun and demanded money
3598139 the owner had access to a gun of his own retrieved the gun fired two shots at the suspect
3598140 both suspects then fled from the store got in a tan sedan
3598141 i dont feel comfortable talking about this because it is a complicated issue for the brand
3598142 i dont speak about it to get paid for it
3598143 i speak about it because i love it i understand theyre a family restaurant but i think it cant hurt them to have a little spice
3598144 we cant forbid people from buying it im sure dom perignon or krug would be delighted to have their business
3598145 the question is do you have to love someone who loves you
3598146 the worst thing to do is turn off someone who is that passionate about you
3598147 a brand doesnt have to actively embrace someone like kendra but they should certainly be willing to accept the fact that shes willing to tell the world how much she loves them
3598148 generally speaking brands benefit from unprompted advocacy but every once in awhile there will be surprises its very difficult to manage
3598149 our position is that our team members as private citizens have freedom to participate

3598156 for u s customs and border protection purposes you can bring out gas and diesel in the factory installed tanks
3598157 and you can use an auxiliary tank but it must be connected with a hose to service that truck and permanently affixed to that truck
3598158 you can bring in more than that but you have to have state and federal permits nobodys doing that around here and i suspect it can be pretty expensive
3598159 and if more than that is brought in it has to be placarded because its considered a hazardous material
3598160 if a person purchases gasoline or fuel while in mexico on other business the purchase is considered incidental to their trip
3598161 if they want to import more diesel fuel for commercial use they will have to make a formal entry at a designated commercial crossing
3598162 hazardous materials may only be imported at a commercial bridge officially designated for processing hazardous materials entries the locations are equipped with appropriate facilities to contain potential hazardous materials spills
3598163 the same thing happened when years ago the price of sugar in the united states just went sky high and again later with coffee

3598166 if youre not compliant we just send you back to mexico
3598167 but once youre warned if you try it again youre subject to vehicle seizure and a flat 5 000 fine
3598168 the fine and the loss of that vehicle kind of makes it not worth it
3598169 of all the criteria about this the most important aspect is that it the carried fuel has to be for that vehicle

3598350 how great a need our world has for a new outpouring of the holy spirit

3598352 many young people today lack hope they are perplexed by the questions that present themselves ever more urgently in a confusing world and they are often uncertain which way to turn for answers they see poverty and injustice and they long to find solutions they are challenged by the arguments of those who deny the existence of god and they wonder how to respond they see great damage done to the natural environment through human greed and they struggle to find ways to live in greater harmony with nature and with one another
3598353 my prayer is that the hearts of the young people who gather in sydney for the celebration of world youth day will truly find rest in the lord and that they will be filled with joy and fervour for spreading the good news among their friends their families and all whom they meet
3598354 to be tied for the most olympic gold for a long time with those names in olympic history it is a pretty amazing accomplishment it is definitely an honour
3598355 ive been doing this for a long time almost seven years with the rocket and four years with the montreal expos and four years with the montreal canadiens and after a while its time for a change
3598356 ive got my university degree in teaching and ive been wanting to do this for a long time ive been toying around with it for the last three years as a matter of fact
3598357 i wasnt expecting that now gary had mentioned to me the past couple of years hed like to move on and do something else
3598358 i had no indication that it would be at this time of the year when training camp is getting underway and everything but he had an offer to move on it was something he wanted to do
3598359 its a big change but instead of having 2 500 to 3 000 people to worry about ill just have 25
3598360 ive never missed a home game with the rocket in all my years
3598361 yeah but i dont have any reason to feel down
3598362 im very proud of my performance so im smiling im having fun and im taking advantage of awesome opportunities that are presenting themselves
3598363 in sydney i did well but i didnt advance to the finals or anything
3598364 the only advice i can give to people is to soak up the inspiration its a pretty cool opportunity to see a bunch of great athletes compete at their best
3598365 when we dont get what we hoped we would get or even come close to it it just takes time to get over that
3598366 make your corrections write down what you will do differently in the future and then go out and enjoy the experience
3598367 enjoy it go see other events go support other canadians thats what im going to do
3598368 im going to explore a bit in china for a couple of days and then im going to be back to support canadian athletes and go to other events and cheer them on
3598369 and when it ends sooner than they had hoped it would end thats really tough
3598370 i would want them to be able to have someone to talk to they do need to talk about it they need to find somebody to hang out with and go to some other events
3598371 you have a free pass to the best show in the entire world

3598483 were extremely happy with where were at right now weve been flirting between second and third in the points and after our run last week at watkins glen were sitting in second weve got our eyes on the prize of getting to the top spot and thats what we want to do we want to run for the championship and contend for it i think we can do that weve got to start plugging away and get 15 20 points a race to have a shot at clint bowyer in the final 10 races were going to have to dig hard i think weve been running well enough on the mile and a half tracks to certainly gain some ground there we need to execute on those tracks and improve our short track program to make it happen
3598484 we got on a roll after darlington it really started there at charlotte and we were on a roll up until the race at orp we kind of struggled there we had a good stretch of 10 or so races where we were consistently getting top fives and top 10s thats what you need to be a contender for the championship just keep clicking off those top five and top 10 finishes we need to get back in that rhythm and finish the year out that way and maybe with a little help from clint we can get the championship
3598485 i was reading something the other day about alan kulwicki when he won his championship in 1992 he wrecked out at dover with six races to go and he was about 280 points behind and came back to win the championship so being only 128 behind clint is not the end of the world we need to race to win and if we can win some races we can close that gap really quickly
3598486 michigan is a track where you never know exactly what youre going to get with it it seems like whenever you work on handling then you need power and need to take drag out of your car then you work on drag and you need handling you work on both of those and get both right and it ends up being a gas mileage race youre never sure exactly how that race is going to play out which makes it challenging its a drivers race track because you can move around on it its nice and wide in the nationwide car its a really big drafting track with the tapered spacer package weve got well really draft well there youll probably see speeds pick up in the race maybe even over qualifying
3598487 michigan is important to me i remember being really young and watching my dad win an arca race there are thinking about how cool that was now im starting to get to the point where im starting to get some recognition from my friends and family for what i do and itd be really cool to get a win in front of them
3598488 you can ultimately run wherever you want to run but the guys that are making the best times and are using their cars to the fullest have that feel where your car is going to be fast or not you know not everyone is going to have the perfect race car but if you can move around if you can go searching for a little bit of grip somewhere on the race track thats where you find speed i think anybody can go out in qualifying and turn a fast lap running right on the bottom and going fast but once the race starts and the groove widens your car may still like to be on the bottom it may like to run the middle or right by the wall so you have to learn and you have to have that feeling well the last time i was here my car was free so im going to run where i did last time and we just build on each race and eventually you get to have a pretty good wealth of knowledge there in your brain and you know whats going on
3598489 i wouldve said well i know we can do it i know weve got the team to do it i know well have the speed to do it its just a matter if we make the right calls and dont make any mistakes and so we have you know ive made a few mistakes this year a couple of calls on pit road and we could be in 10th or 11th right now but im sure everybody can always go back and change what they have done in the past but yeah we knew from the get go that if we made the right decisions and didnt hurt ourselves that we would have the speed and have the team to be there and thats why were here today and thats what weve got to stay focused on trying not to make mistakes trying to make good wise decisions on pit road and ultimately well have a good day and get a little closer to that chase
3598490 i dont know exactly what it is but ill tell you what i feel awful lucky to be a part of that because michigan has just right off the very first time i saw the race track i was on it in the nascar craftsman truck series adapted to the track very well loved the race track the way it raced i raced twice there in the craftsman trucks undefeated the two times i went there and raced then came back and got two more wins in the sprint cup series so that race track has been one of my favorites right out of the get go and roush fenway has been very good there for a long time jeff burton and mark martin had a lot of success there and carl and matt its just been a great track for us its been a great track for me personally and i probably have got the benefit of our organization being good there as well
3598491 i dont know i think jack could probably answer that question a lot better than myself but i see ford still very involved in our organization and the sport theyre very passionate about nascar and a lot of the race fans are the guys that support the ford product they support our teams just the same as i think they always have in the past we know that all automotive times are tough all the car industry is not doing the same with the fuel prices and all the things but theyre still just as passionate about it they know that the nascar fan is their customer and they help us technically to do what we need to do as much as they can
3598492 ford in particular has got some research data that indicates that if the broader population had a 30 percent chance of being interested in a ford product going to a ford dealership the
3598493 yes it is because a lot of exercise is heart rate whether youre running on a treadmill or doing a stair stepper or elliptical a lot of focus is on heart rate our heart rate is 150 or higher for five hours inside that car when you sweat out four five or six pounds of water weight certainly that is a lot of workout that a guy goes through on saturdays and sundays and i can tell the difference honestly this year ive only run about 12 nationwide races versus normally i run every weekend i can certainly tell the difference ive been at the gym a little bit more than i have in the past last night i work out in the evenings and ive been one or two nights a week keeping fit especially for the chase coming up i want to be the best i can be and be prepared to give a run at the title
3598494 seeing the fara logo on jimmies helmet would give some visibility to finding a cure for a fatal disease that affects children while giving hope and enjoyment to those kids that are afflicted by fa
3598495 to be honest with you im shocked that we havent won here weve had very good cars and have been in contention a couple of different times it always seems like theres a crazy strategy at the end that keeps us from winning its either a two tire deal weve taken no tires when weve had a great race car and been leading and lost to guys that have had tires weve also lost to fuel mileage before so its just a weird finish to this race in some cases the best car wins here but in other cases its something strategy wise that plays out and it just hasnt worked for us here
3598496 i dont think about it that much to be honest with you i just give it everything i can every lap and if its for a win great i think texas was a good example of that last year of racing with matt kenseth i really wasnt thinking about what was on the line i just knew that we could win and i was going to do what i could to win over the years and that may change ive had a good understanding of whats pushing too hard and whats not trying hard enough and finding that balance to race for wins and win a lot of races but not make too many mistakes and i hope that never changes if that does change and i make bad decisions then ill probably think a little bit more but right now i just try to keep things as simple as possible i try to lead a lap to get the bonus and try to lead the most laps if i can and try to finish as good as i can without sticking it in the fence and without not finishing the event
3598497 i still cant believe were sixth in points right now
3598498 at the end of the day results speak louder than words we need to post good
3598499 this dupont team is capable of winning the championship this year thanks to the chase structure
3598500 a lot can happen in 10 races and we need to make sure
3598501 we have the tools necessary to do it and a strong showing this weekend can put us on the right track
3598502 ive always enjoyed racing here and i hope its fun again on sunday
3598503 we were decent in june but we lost track position during one exchange of pit stops and
3598504 staying in the lead group is a good way to stay out of traffic
3598505 for my wife melissa taylor and our two other boys we were totally blown away by the experience we had at give kids the world
3598506 the kids didnt want to leave to go to disney world they wanted to stay right there in the village at give kids the world
3598507 the greatest thing about the whole experience was that for one week it allowed taylor and the rest of us to live as if nothing was wrong we all forgot about the trials and tribulations that come with fighting leukemia thats what makes give kids the world so invaluable and thanks to the impact it had on our entire family and thousands of others we plan on partnering with them for years to come
3598508 the car will give me some good camouflage during the race because with a purple blue yellow and red race car that has a bunny rabbit on the hood no one will know that its me getting ready to pass them it was actually designed by emily marsala a cancer survivor who during her treatment visited give kids the world down in florida she and her family will be at the race as our guests as her design is on our race car to commemorate old spices support of give kids the world earlier this year joe gibbs racing old spice and the tony stewart foundation donated 100 000 to give kids the world its my last race with the team and i want to go out on top for me and for emily and her parents
3598509 when you can win five out of eight races with an organization that in itself is impressive just to be part of a record breaking year for the organization is something that im really proud of ive never won a nationwide race at michigan we shouldve won the first two that i ran there the first year with dale jr in his car 2003 we dominated it led 86 laps and got caught out by weather at the end and didnt even finish in the top 10 because of rain ever since then every time we go to michigan i feel like ive got something to prove i feel like i have a win that i let slip through my fingers that i want to capitalize on
3598510 obviously were proud of him and of what hes done proud of his effort and work ethic at the shop youre proud to be a part of his season and his record breaking season it makes you proud just to be a part of it and know that you were a part of making that happen with him its neat how things make full circles a lot of times

3598553 its not the camera that takes the photo its the photographer
3598554 i never knew what to expect after i got my first win the touring car but it seems like the entire paddock guys like peter cunningham pierre kleinubing and the rest of the guys made a point to congratulate me and the rest of the team it means a lot i think they understand how hard weve been working to make this happen
3598555 ive been here before ive had races i could have won before and have known it was something our team was ready for but so often something silly would happen and the win would slip away i wouldnt let myself celebrate until i passed the start finish line
3598556 i knew we could win all weekend long i dont mean to sound matter of fact but this result is what i knew i was capable of and what i knew our car and team was capable of all year long im really happy to have won but im not surprised if anything it reaffirms that we have the right ingredients and can win more races
3598557 the biggest thing i have to say is that this wasnt my win today this was our win ive been working with some of these guys on the team for almost a decade our crew chief jason marks and chief mechanic david simpkins are a part of the foundation bimmerworld has been built on and the rest of the team regardless of how long theyve been here have all paid into our success with long hours and incredible determination marks and his crew have helped me to step up the entire bimmerworld racing organization and they deserve a result like this every weekend
3598558 i was able to get on the power super early leading onto the front straight the torque of our bmw engine coming up the hill closed the gap a few times
3598559 i was catching everybody under brakes every braking zone i was able to brake 50 75 feet deeper than the mazdas and acuras performance friction has been major partner of ours for some time and without them i dont know if i could have finished as well as i did anytime you can keep accelerating while the car youre chasing is starting to brake youve got a big advantage and thats just what pfc gives us
3598560 seeing james standing on the top step of the podium is something i thought wouldve happened a long time ago but it wasnt for a lack of skill or effort when i first started driving in world challenge i thought james would be the first one of us to get a win today he proved me right
3598561 am i jealous heck yeah i am but im proud of my teammate james getting the win is almost the same as me getting the win we both have worked so hard to get here and now one of us has kicked the monkey off our back james drove the best race of his life he put himself where he needed to be to win and never thought differently awesome job
3598562 long before i was a member of this team i was a competitor seeing james pull it off is simply proof that good guys who try hard do indeed win pd peter cunningham and randy pobst were some of the first guys to come over to congratulate james c l a y clay clay clay
3598563 there were some real battles out there but my dice with kuno wittmer was the best i bump drafted him passed charles espenlaub who is tough to pass and then used the momentum to get by kuno in turn five there were things like that all throughout the race the quality of driving was the best ive seen this year it was also pleasure not to get crashed out from behind again after five instances of other races ruined by overzealous driving
3598564 considering i was nauseous in the car from food poisoning during qualifying and then got blocked along with pd by jim daniels on our hot lap i was reasonably happy with my finish
3598565 its a relief weve known we were capable of it and now that clays won its just shown what weve been trying to do all along this is what were going after every weekend its ironic james said it was one of the easiest races hes driven hes worked a lot harder to finish lower in the grand scheme of things this was one of our smoothest weekends so far now we need to keep doing it
3598566 everybody asked us if we were out partying it up in wisconsin sunday night but actually we loaded up the trailer and went back to catch up on some much needed sleep its certainly a big relief to win again but the train doesnt stop moving we have a few more races to try and get another one well party once the seasons over
3598567 having wayne as our engineer has really transformed the e90s handling its so driveable our e90s get better at every race
3598568 as i mentioned before the hard work and expertise of our crew is what allows the drivers to succeed and waynes an important part of that process
3598569 everything he has touched has made the cars easier to drive and faster on the track for this to be his first team to work with in speed world challenge and his first ever win engineering a touring car i would say hes doing a great job
3598570 maple grove is a beautiful facility and the only bad thing is that the shut down area is a little bumpy but other than that the track is usually fast and they have good air which creates great racing conditions
3598571 the points really dont matter right now because its all going to change when the countdown to 1 begins following the u s nationals were just going to try and keep marching on and winning rounds and try to put this schumacher electric suzuki in the winners circle

3598601 in the year and a half since i read the millioniare real estate agent book i have worked on one of the central goals that the book speaks about defining my big why has been a major challenge in my short time being coached by darin i am amazed at how quickly he was able to assist me to define my true big why thank you
3598602 the solutions coaching program that darin has introduced to our office has invigorated my business i am creating systems to automate my business strategies to increase my production and my skill level so that know what to say and when from implementing all this in the last month it has led to about 4 000 000 in business 36 new leads and more coming i am addicted to the sense of purpose that darins solutons coaching program gives you
3598603 in addition to having that financing clout they have expressed interest in establishing an international presence
3598604 why disney would come back to the table and buy those parks is questionable
3598605 im not aware of them buying other attractions thats just not something they do their parks are heavily branded
3598606 if disney came in theyd want to disneyfy the park and make it completely different than it is today anythings feasible but why
3598607 even though one may not be from a strategic position interested in buying these parks there are many companies that could be interested in buying them at a good price

3598624 this has a two fold purpose first it started 81 years ago primarily as a celebration of the feast for the assumption of the virgin mary the parishioners began to gather at a picnic in seekonk and then it broadened into what it is now
3598625 second its the major fundraiser for the parish and the monies will be used for our greek school our sunday school youth organizations and also our dance troupes the good news is that our prices are the same except for a couple of meat dishes and those have only gone up a dollar i will say its worth the price because we provide an authentic atmosphere as well
3598626 the goal of the parish is to replicate greek adornments for such a festival
3598627 if youve ever seen the movie mamma mia youll understand in it which was filmed in the isle of skiathos the bride rode a donkey up the mountainside

3598633 zondag om middernacht zijn we vertrokken vanuit tbilisi de hoofdstad van georgi red met een busje van de nederlandse ambassade
3598634 we waren niet verplicht om te vertrekken maar we hadden weinig keus
3598635 dus wat doe je dan als je een baby van elf maanden hebt vertrekken natuurlijk ook al was het voor mijn man verschrikkelijk hij wilde zijn vrienden en familie niet achterlaten maar door in georgi te blijven helpen we hen niet dat besefte garri ook vanuit belgi kunnen we nog geld en spulletjes opsturen
3598636 we wilden dora laten zien aan garris vrienden en familie
3598637 we logeerden met vrienden in een huisje in de bergen en waren van de buitenwereld afgesneden maar dat er wat aan de hand was dat wisten we wel onderweg naar de bergen waren we tanks en soldaten gepasseerd en s nachts zagen we lichtflitsen in het donker

3598654 its inelastic demand as far as many of these stocks are concerned

3598659 op dat moment voerden verschillende politiediensten discreet een onderzoek stel dat het effectief om maddie ging dan hadden haar ontvoerders of de mensen bij wie het kind verbleef tijd genoeg gehad om haar weer te laten verdwijnen
3598660 al vijf jaar gaan wij en een bevriend echtpaar uit breda elke zaterdag ontbijten in de ikea daar
3598661 het is voor ons een dagje uit wij genieten daarvan wat moet een bejaarde meer hebben
3598662 we kennen de mensen daar al goed en er wordt wat afgelachen
3598663 ik kreeg botweg te horen dat ikea me aanklaagde voor meerdere diefstallen van voedsel hij beweerde dat een getuige had gemeld dat ik kaas hesp en hardgekookte eieren in mijn broekzak had gestoken de beschuldiging was te gek voor woorden ik kom nooit in de voedingsafdeling van ikea het zijn altijd onze echtgenotes die het ontbijt gaan halen
3598664 ik mocht mijn man niet zien en kreeg te horen dat hij mee naar het politiekantoor moest ik vroeg of ze hem terugbrachten dat zal wel dat we zon heimelijke smikkelaar terugbrengen we zijn geen taxibedrijf kreeg ik te horen
3598665 ik werd behandeld als een crimineel zo bleef een agente tijdens mijn toiletbezoek gewoon in de deuropening staan
3598666 de bewakingscamera had niets geregistreerd en de officier van justitie kwam me persoonlijk melden dat de zaak was geseponeerd
3598667 toen een directielid mijn verhaal hoorde zat hij met zijn hoofd in zijn handen hij wist van niets de veiligheidsagent had gehandeld buiten zijn medeweten toch kon er geen excuus af en bleef het toegangsverbod gehandhaafd
3598668 wij hebben niet te lijden onder het succes van de datingsites we hebben dan ook een ander publiek
3598669 ik zie dus goed hoe het fenomeen ge volueerd is
3598670 twintig jaar geleden waren de meeste mensen in de club tegen de 30 nu zijn de meeste leden tussen 45 en 50 jaar oud om de een of andere reden blijven de jongeren weg en dat is jammer
3598671 wij doen veel buitenactiviteiten en de natuur is nu eenmaal de beste plaats om iemand op een natuurlijke manier te leren kennen
3598672 15 jaar geleden werd je als single als hopeloos beschouwd
3598673 nu is de singlemarkt veel groter geworden en panikeren de mensen niet meer zo vlug
3598674 er is stijgende vraag naar zulke dansavonden zelfs bij iets jongere mensen elke keer komen er zon 200 tot 300 singles op af
3598675 de nieuwe tests wijzen uit dat een zwaarder of een groter model van een wagen vaak een stuk zuiniger is dan het voorgaande en dus oudere model van diezelfde auto
3598676 de vervuilingsgraad van de nieuwe modellen ligt gemiddeld 100 procent lager wat betekent dat ze twee keer zo schoon zijn de vaak gehoorde kritiek dat wagens meer gaan uitstoten omdat ze groter krachtiger en zwaarder worden klopt dus niet

3598685 more students are reaching at least a minimum level of readiness for college credit courses
3598686 were keeping a lot of kids from having to take remedial level courses
3598687 we have a more heterogeneous population of test takers so were including those kids who werent considering college or arent considering college
3598688 this is a recognition that our system will need to grow at a faster rate than even a generous and committed legislature can fund to produce the degrees arizona needs
3598689 do we have a model that increasingly restricts admission because of costs or do we have a higher rate of productivity that will bring down the cost of each degree
3598690 if we can do that without sacrificing quality we need to do it perhaps we can combine some departments and reduce administrative costs and still not lessen the quality of the product to the students
3598691 we graduate kids at ua at a rate of 5 7 years
3598692 if we can take that down by three or four or five tenths it doesnt cost us more money but well be graduating more in fewer years and your cost per pupil goes down

3598700 hij is daar aangevallen door een ram van de kudde
3598701 de buurvrouw is op zijn hulpgeroep afgekomen omdat zij zelf niets kon doen heeft ze mij erbij gehaald die ram ging telkens op zijn achterste poten staan en stootte met zijn kop mijn vader aan hij probeerde recht te staan maar dat lukte niet
3598702 ik deed dat zonder nadenken ik had niet eens een stok of zo bij me ik stampte dat beest enkele keren hard maar brak daarbij mijn teen
3598703 toen ik ter plekke kwam leefde mijn vader zeker nog maar die ram bleef tekeergaan alsof hij een ander mannetje bleef aanvallen in de natuur doen ze dat ook tot n erbij neervalt het zijn in ieder geval beelden die ik nooit meer vergeet ik heb nooit eerder gehoord dat een ram een mens aanviel een stier wel ja

3598706 were seeing an increase in consumer awareness of a variety of mobile advertising campaigns from text message to interactive games to mobile internet banner advertisements
3598707 with mobile phone usage growing its logical for more companies to seek mobile marketing as a way to reach their segmented targets in this direct and highly interactive medium
3598708 these findings indicate the degree to which the mobile phone is used as a marketing channel with enhanced handsets and flat rate data tariffs increasingly common it is only a matter of time before mobile internet advertising starts to rival the penetration of sms or text message marketing
3598709 g d shall guard you from all evil he shall guard your soul g d shall guard your going out and your coming in from this time forth and for evermore

3598713 in the night when my child used to be in her room one of the inmates used to forcibly enter her room and sleep with her she used to behave indecently with my daughter isnt this enough evidence
3598714 they used to make her do hard work clean all the rooms floors they tortured her otherwise why should a 22 year old girl end her life

3598716 until we are absolutely certain that everything is 100 per cent correct we cannot operate the aircraft
3598717 what we picked up is a step in the maintenance check which does not look like it has been completed and thats why weve got to go back and verify that
3598718 if the basis of the round doha negotiations initiated seven years ago has to see a change in its very objectives it would be a tough going for global trade integration
3598719 it cannot be expected to accept the flaws the price developing countries are being asked to pay for developed countries to cut subsidies
3598720 my simple message here in delhi and next week in washington is that members should look carefully at what is on the table and not on results listen to all wto members and efforts should be to conclude the talks
3598721 the good news is there may be still a possibility to move this forward and conclude negotiations within the time frame that is end 2008
3598722 the u s will be able to spend much more on subsidies
3598723 one of the reasons for decline in production is the trade distorting subsidies and high tariffs in the rich countries
3598724 if the eu says we are going to reduce tariffs for airplanes what does it mean for india and africa
3598725 i want to import cotton from africa but if there is 40 per cent subsidy in the u s my industry is not going to buy it from africa
3598726 we are concerned that there is a great deal of external inspiration and support we are also concerned and are looking at a mastermind within the country
3598727 clearly there is some kind of organisation we have to find out if that organisation is localised or there is an external group or module operating
3598728 but it leaves a big vacuum and we are deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghanistan border but clearly our side of the border too
3598729 like nature abhors a vacuum we abhor the political vacuum that exists in pakistan it greatly worries us
3598730 and if at all he has to go he will be allowed to go in grace and some sort of a compromise would be reached obviously that is not happening mr nawaz sharif leader of the pakistan muslim league nawaz is very angry
3598731 quite obviously pakistan wishes to be the only country in afghanistan so it can have afghanistan as its client state
3598732 therefore we expect that something would be done rather than mere words
3598733 i think the message went home pakistan prime minister gilani got the message
3598734 isi is behind it according to whatever information we have
3598735 the indian automotive engineering services outsourcing industry is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 32 cagr by 2012 13 the industry has generated revenues to the tune of 500 600 million last year and there is 2 2 billion potential outsourcing opportunity in the next two years
3598736 vendors would offer me leftover produce i couldnt stand to see it go to waste so i would take it home and can it then i would give them a couple of jars and keep some for myself
3598737 canning is not my favorite thing to do but tomatoes are my favorite thing to have
3598738 most recipes instruct to remove it but either way they are going to be a little slimy
3598739 i keep a lot of what i can but i also trade with others and give some as gifts
3598740 i try to use as much local stuff as possible cloves and cinnamon are the only things not local in this
3598741 it didnt set but i found that i could mix it with plain yogurt and it was delicious
3598742 there are some things that are more difficult than others but if you follow directions you can pretty much do it
3598743 we think in a high renewables future there is scope for more large scale hydro
3598744 somewhere there is a reflection of a paternal thinking and there is an absence of equality on the other hand quran professes equality this is an attempt to initiate change and break away from tradition we are trying to implement the change on ourselves
3598745 whenever a woman marries a man then experience tells us that her rights are often supressed so this is our attempt to bring parity in rights
3598746 be it any religion all responsibilities of solemnising weddings have been entrusted only to men and not women

3598749 its a wonderfully eclectic objet dart speckled with an observable indifference for maureen dowd
3598750 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
3598751 trying to get them to understand everything because they still have a hard time just grasping it all
3598752 at this point any conflict i might have is more than eased by the knowledge that barack obama if elected could be the salvation of a country in free flight failure
3598753 faces at the bottom of the well the permanence of racism
3598754 if he sounded as i might wish him to sound he could not be elected
3598755 and he may not be elected even as his intellect and savvy puts him worlds ahead of his republican counterpart and that is all i wish to say on the matter
3598756 im not arguing that its wrong to vote for obama though i do say its wrong headed to vote for him with any lofty expectations
3598757 i feel this sometimes has something to do with something i care about and as things go in u s politics its not the worst thing to happen
3598758 how race survived u s history from settlement and slavery to the obama phenomenon
3598759 obama does not represent the triumph of an advancing anti racist movement but rather the necessity at the highly refracted level of electoral politics of abandoning old agendas largely by not mentioning them
3598760 its an odd paradox that this will shrink even further any kind of public space to talk about race
3598761 theyre voting for the end of affirmative action and they dont even know it
3598762 theyre voting for the end of race and they dont even know it
3598763 everybody is so enticed and intrigued all at once just by the mere fact that hes black as if thats enough
3598764 from that to seeing barack obama and the enthusiasm hes generated its almost full circle to me that america could grow to the point where it could see someone like barack obama in a different light
3598765 his candidacy hinged on putting a happy face on racism and here he reveals to his credit knowledge and compassion about racism and its tentacles into the present he was running away from history and this has forced him to talk about the past which blows away his transcendental cover
3598766 you remarked that reverend jeremiah wright expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country
3598767 we believe that wright is exactly right that racism is not only endemic but is at the core of american society as reflected in a large and well established body of social scientific research
3598768 it was the best speech on race ever given by a major presidential candidate
3598769 i think it really is going to change the way responsible people talk about racism
3598770 their basic idea that racism is at the heart of how americans feel simply has been shown not to be true in the way that they said it
3598771 are they still going to whine endlessly about racism in america
3598772 there is going to be a furious effort to use evidence to show that racism is still this deep scar in the american experience
3598773 theres a big chunk of white america that wishes blacks well and doesnt feel contempt or dislike for them people talk about a backlash but it never enters their head that their might be a frontlash
3598774 i think it will be hugely positive if obama wins because there will be this possibility of a more genuine conversation between scholars of different orientations
3598775 i think it will mess up the congestion in a way that will be very healthy i cant wait for that part of it
3598776 to give up that thrilled sense of possibility that thrilled sense that something really big might be changing in this area which is so long overdue
3598777 they took all the jewelry they took the chains they took the bracelets they took the rings
3598778 thank god theyre alive they did threaten them but thats it they didnt do anything to them
3598779 it looks like the assailants wore masks they were well clothed and they had gloves on so identification may be a trouble now
3598780 when she went to check the noise she was actually grabbed by two men outside the window she tried to fight with them but they took her down to the floor at gunpoint then they duct taped her hands and feet and placed her three year old daughter on the floor as they ransacked the house
3598781 if guinness want to keep the irish harp on the pint of stout
3598782 clearly muh which is managing a budgetary shortfall of 4 5m cannot provide the resources required
3598783 i very much regret as the minister for health that a state of the art facility that cost so much public money lies idle i would appeal to the staff to go into that facility and make that facility available to patients
3598784 ultimately and its hard to say with a straight face but star wars is a very small little personal story
3598785 its really about a guy turning bad and then being redeemed by his son so you really cant deal with a lot of extraneous stuff
3598786 i knew that there were clones against droids and i knew that the clones turned against jedi and that they were the precursor of the stormtroopers but thats about all i knew
3598787 since this is saturday morning television i said lets go back and find the retro reality when i was growing up which was thunderbirds
3598788 i said lets do it as kind of like marionettes

3598816 so much of the debates within christendom goes on about what happens in the meeting
3598817 we are talking about a life and love model of church where a meeting is only a part it is a part but not the entirety
3598818 if this the things we do on a sunday morning is all that we will do in the future heaven then god help us i dont want to do that forever
3598819 as we live our lives together open our homes live our marriages serve love together this is a foretaste of what the future looks like to the world around us
3598820 to the extent that our church is defined by the formal meeting we have on sunday morning to that extent we are failing to be the church that christ died for
3598821 there is little the world is willing to do to blunt russian power and thats because of oil
3598822 europe cant resist russia because many countries on the continent are totally dependent on russian oil and natural gas putin knows he has the continent over a barrel
3598823 we still do not have a cohesive plan to get away from foreign oil and both parties are at fault the next president must lead us into a sane energy situation
3598824 the democrats have no specific alternative plan some republicans love the oil companies and say we can drill our way to independence ridiculous
3598825 if we dont get home grown fuel soon we will fight world war iii our children will die because of foreign oil buying foreign oil has greatly weakened america so lets finally deal with it
3598826 the worlds a dangerous place and the countries that control the oil wield a lot of power if the united states cant wean itself off of foreign oil we will have to fight to supply our energy needs

3598828 he said to me that he was disappointed because although the team lost in cyprus it was as if it was only me that made ireland lose
3598829 i already said to him that when you do the work you have to accept the criticism i have to accept that many many times people will be critical of me im sure that in 10 years time he will say why
3598830 we have been in contact with ireland and he has let us know that hes not ready to make himself available for this squad
3598831 he has maybe had problems with family or psychologically but its a question of when he wants to come back and that hes convinced about his decision
3598832 we have to respect the other players as well thats very important but how old is he 21 22 theres a long time
3598833 i know very well lee carsley hes experienced i know what hes doing on the pitch in games the team we had in portugal had time to learn to bond as a team

3598843 the new album greetings from jackass flats is also all original music we recorded the new cd at sound of music here in richmond we love recording our first trip into the studio was tough because we were face to face with what we really sounded like and we struggled to get what we wanted now once we get the tunes written and arranged we cant wait to flesh out our ideas in the studio on the new disc we added some strings to a couple of songs and put down some textured vocals hell were already thinking about crazy production ideas for the next record

3598927 this new laptop is a real beast with a configuration that tops quite a few desktop workstations
3598928 lenovo is doing a great job of paying attention to what unique customer segments really need and desire this system is aimed squarely at multimedia professionals and lenovo has designed a system that gives them pretty much everything on their wish list from a high end quad core processor to 8 gb memory high end discrete video cards and dual hard drives with a blu ray burner to boot
3598929 the built in digitizer and color calibrator will appeal to the professionals but the rest of the system i think will prove tempting to a wider audience
3598930 this system will certainly get the attention of the prosumer crowd which are consumers who buy professional gear they may pick up the system to handle their own multimedia creation needs or even use it primarily as a pc gaming platform its the biggest and baddest laptop on the market and is sure to pick up significant sales on that basis alone

3598936 this staggering acquisition will enable lacma to present multiple narratives of nineteenth and twentieth century photography to its actual and virtual visitors and to enhance the appreciation of photography as marjorie and leonard always hoped the collection would wallis annenberg who shares the same vision has been incredibly thoughtful about what it takes to create a world class accessible photography department at lacma
3598937 photography claims an ever larger presence within the history of art twenty first century encyclopedic museums like lacma must have a substantial and growing commitment to photography and media wallis annenbergs gift makes this possible
3598938 i have a passion for photography and a deep belief in lacma they will undoubtedly inspire others to love this art form as much as i do im thrilled to see a collection of this magnitude find a home in a local institution that is increasingly an international force in the museum world
3598939 my parents would be pleased to know that the collection they so passionately fostered will remain together in los angeles a city rapidly developing into a photography collecting hub

3598963 consumers have been pessimistic for several months primarily because of the strains on their budgets from higher gas and food prices
3598964 these survey results indicate that consumers will likely stick to the basics this fall and parents may be saying no more often as they head to the register
3598965 but the jury is still out on how much intention will translate into action
3598966 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized

3598975 the key is to try is to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california
3598976 anybody who tells you they know when the housing market will bottom is delusional but anybody who denies there are some positives out there that could make the housing market bottom fairly soon is equally delusional
3598977 the key is to try is to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california
3598978 california is the linchpin and so if the region flattens that changes everything
3598979 the data came in much better than we were expecting and much better than the market was expecting
3598980 i think a lot of the increase has to do with foreclosure sales which are selling at a quicker pace and have a faster turnaround time
3598981 housing market data is certainly showing early signs of stabilization on the activity side and home price side
3598982 we are not at the end of tunnel yet but more indicators are starting to look as if we are at least getting closer to it

3598985 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3598986 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3598987 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3598988 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3598989 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3598990 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3598991 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3598992 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3598993 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3598994 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3598995 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3598996 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3598997 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3598998 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3598999 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3599000 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3599001 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3599002 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3599003 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3599004 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3599005 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3599006 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3599007 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3599008 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3599009 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3599010 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3599011 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes

3599022 for power constrained data centers and weve talked to a few clients who are worried about breaking things because theyre pushing the limits of their power so hard there is definitely some value in it
3599023 but for just a server farm where youre talking about tens or hundreds of nodes theres not as much value as there would be with a desktop virtual infrastructure where you might be talking about thousands of nodes that could be shut down overnight when theyre not being used

3599035 debemos aprovechar al m ximo nuestra condici n de local y el apoyo de nuestra gente para ganar el domingo contra almagro
3599036 tenemos mucha confianza por eso les pedimos a los hinchas que tengan paciencia y nos apoyen
3599037 lo importante es mantener la calma el domingo ni nosotros ni san mart n jugamos bien por lo que creo que el empate hubiera sido lo m s justo para ambos aunque ellos supieron aprovechar una pelota parada y marcaron la diferencia
3599038 a medida que pasen los d as iremos encontrando el equipo en san juan jugamos con varios chicos que reci n se incorporaban al plantel y lo hicimos bien la defensa era totalmente nueva y funcion bastante bien por ah donde nos quebramos fue en la zona media pues a los volantes les cost un poco generar juego para los delanteros eso es propio de la falta de conocimiento

3599043 necesitamos una secundaria que se haga cargo de la obligatoriedad esto significa que acepte al alumnado sin selectividad y que sea capaz de trabajar con la diversidad
3599044 deben ser escuelas con un clima propicio para ense ar y aprender esto no tiene que ver con una visi n rom ntica de la escuela sino con la posibilidad de constituir grupos convencidos de la tarea que desarrolla la instituci n
3599045 no estaba pensada para la masividad pero en los ltimos a os vamos avanzando hacia una cobertura mayor esto no solamente pone en crisis el mandato tradicional sino que convoca a una constituci n diferente de la escuela para poder hacerse cargo de la heterogeneidad que implica lo masivo
3599046 as como hace 100 a os fue la escuela primaria la que acept el mandato de la obligatoriedad y con la cual se relacionaron fuertemente el progreso y la promoci n social de la argentina hoy sabemos que eso no es suficiente y que la escuela secundaria es la que est llamada a esa transformaci n social

3599063 we developed a chip targeted at performance and then we took two of those chips and put them on one card people have tried to build bigger chips but the problem has been heat and cost its difficult for them to put two on one board because of space and power limitations
3599064 its good to see amd ati back in the high performance game
3599065 the new card looks like it will be able to deliver the goods to high end gamers a lucrative and desirable market moreover amds single card but dual gpu 4870 x2 can if early reviews are on target out perform dual card configurations from nvidia

3599077 aqu no hay malos ni buenos no hay h roes ni villanos no hay fiestas ni bailes que invitan a los chicos a divertirse arriba del escenario sin embargo la historia mantiene expectante tanto a los chicos como a los adultos porque ana alvarado la autora de la pieza propone un teatro en el que la funci n del espectador debe ser la de observar mirar y contemplar todo ese po tico mundo narrado en la obra
3599078 en este caso el centro de la actividad del ni o est ubicado en la estimulaci n de su capacidad imaginativa y en la exaltaci n de sus ideas es decir que el chico es invitado a reflexionar sobre lo que sucede y sus consecuencias buscamos provocar que surjan sus sentimientos y emociones

3599086 only a regime in the final straits of desperation would pay any heed to an illiterate farm girl who claimed that the voice of god was instructing her to take charge of her countrys army and lead it to victory

3599088 complaints would be appropriate if this movie wasnt as side splitting as it consistently is or if it didnt have the guts and discipline to take its premise to the wall and crash right through it
3599089 makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3599090 but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3599091 in our culture retard and retarded carry a lot of baggage from the days when people were institutionalized in large state facilities
3599092 today children with all types of disabilities are included in all types of schools people are employed in all types of jobs they work they vote they pay taxes they dont deserve to be treated in such a dehumanizing way
3599093 adults with retardation self advocated they clearly told us that the use of the word retarded was very hurtful words like retard idiot and moron create negative stereotypes that lead to discrimination and often times abuse just as certain words do for african americans or people of the jewish faith
3599094 and its not a mental disability its an intellectual disability because it involves abstract thinking and comprehension
3599095 theres probably nothing more fundamental to civil rights than the ability to name oneself you wouldnt call someone a negro today and we use asian instead of oriental
3599096 even if the movie is spectacular it imbeds that speech in society you cant legislate against it but you can advocate about the damage that gets done
3599097 thats not even a question it went by the wayside years ago because its so offensive
3599098 thats entertainment theres a lot thats offensive in the movies you vote with your dollars plenty of people will see it because its offensive thats the world we live in

3599103 i believe that we need to create a special committee in the u s senate to exercise oversight over contracting abuses related to reconstruction and the wars in iraq and afghanistan

3599115 thats just its wrong its a place where families come to eat and them taking a bath in the sink thats just not work ethic

3599117 thats just disgusting i wouldnt want to eat here after i heard something like that thats just not appropriate for employment

3599148 offenses have gotten smart and they are putting more skill position players out there and making you cover them all
3599149 it has completely changed the way we have to recruit

3599333 the scale and specificity of russia s attacks indicates detailed planning
3599334 essentially russia copied the serbia and kosovo scenario one to one crippling of infrastructure destroying military capacity undermining the lawful regime and claiming humanitarian intervention
3599335 it is the european union that can and should be the strong power that induces the russian federation to end its military activity on the territory of the republic of georgia
3599336 war has broken out in europe a european nation has fallen victim to the aggression of its neighbor and the european union as the bearer of european values cannot remain a helpless bystander
3599337 we both understand that the european union faces a very serious and fundamental choice because the russian attacks against georgia unavoidably confront us with the task of reviewing several aspects of current cooperation between the european union and russia
3599338 russia s military strikes in georgia toll a knell for many of europe s hopes such the possibility of sharing common fundamental values with russia
3599339 we have plans that help us implement increased security measures as threats go up we have plans that help us respond to incidents as they go todays exercise really just helps us actually work out some of the kinks and get some of the boats on the water and some of the processes in place
3599340 we have crisis management plans all of these agencies have their own crisis management plans the important thing is now to sort of unify them thats why were in the unified command and make sure that we cover all aspects of the scenario based on our individual plans
3599341 anything could happen in this incident they brandished a gun if theyre really or not we dont know they very well could hurt somebody
3599342 one of them was a larger guy and one of them was kind of a slender guy hopefully somebody knows these people and maybe theyve bragged to somebody or told somebody
3599343 we said in the referendum that we didnt want that and now hes put it in the decrees
3599344 you cant talk to a psycho like a normal human being
3599345 they created a very dangerous situation with the barricades they put up
3599346 it was especially bad at night because they had lights on top of the barricades that sent out all of these confusing signals there were five accidents at this same location before our client was killed there
3599347 they all occurred while cars were turning left and they all happened at night
3599348 you can do construction right and you can do it wrong and the construction company needs to be aware of the potential for accidents to anticipate them and to prevent them by the way they design the intersection during the construction interval
3599349 i know youre thinking he cant vote his opinion doesnt matter the selection affects all americans
3599350 im a republican because i know that the way to a better economy is lower taxes so the government isnt wasting money on useless projects

3599352 i am a very big john mccain supporter and i think he will be the best leader for this country
3599353 he goes well ive written this speech and i said that sounds wonderful and he figured out how to put it on youtube and he did
3599354 why dont you take some time to lie down you dont want to overdo it
3599355 he can be a danger to the community he may have a problem with an individual but hell move anybody that gets in his way out of his way and we dont want that violent encounter to happen
3599356 they did bring in four more portables to help with the space issue
3599357 i think kind of a good thing because theres more of a diversity here and itll be fun to meet more people
3599358 was i really putting my hope in some movie you might say

3599391 we have some debt that will be paid out of that
3599392 roe ran a grass roots campaign that challenged the status quo and put people before politics there is no doubt that he will be the next representative for tennessees 1st district

3599441 im thirsty can you point me to the soda pop aisle
3599442 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3599443 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3599444 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3599445 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3599446 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3599447 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3599448 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
3599449 follow me unless you have something more interesting going on
3599450 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
3599451 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
3599452 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
3599453 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3599454 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
3599455 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
3599456 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death
3599457 this country is an experiment and for it to have endured for this long it requires the involvement of citizens citizens making choices

3599461 when you get on an aeroplane do you go and see if the pilots smiling
3599462 hello this is john prescott please go out and vote
3599463 i said gordon brown is the right man for the job at the end of the day they believed in those times that that ship could never sink the captain still had a responsibility but the thing that actually sank it was the iceberg the challenge is how do you navigate around it

3599465 he has a voting record to the left of vermont sen bernie sanders and sanders is a socialist
3599466 for me the issue is israel with obama you get louis farrakhan and rev jeremiah wright coming in the back door to the white house
3599467 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors
3599468 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
3599469 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
3599470 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
3599471 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its committment to georgias territorial integrity that committment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their committment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense committment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
3599472 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
3599473 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3599474 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3599475 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3599476 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3599477 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3599478 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3599479 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
3599480 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls

3599507 fuller never met him bryant but re creating him has dragged her into a world of greed and power and destruction and beauty more instructive on the unsettled state of the democratic party and its current leftward drift we are witnessing a tectonic shift from the centrism that president clinton embraced and imposed on his restive followers to a more open throated liberalism now referred to as progressivism that is angry and spoiling for a fight
3599508 one thousand years after the formidable war machines of the user cultures devoured entire civilizations and rewrote planetary geography earth is in the grip of a perpetual dark age scientific endeavor is strongly discouraged while remnant technology is locked away hidden by a church determined to prevent a new armageddon this is the world to which benzamir michael mahmood must return a descendant of the tribes who fled the planet during those ages old wars he comes in pursuit of enemies from the far reaches of space the technology he brings is wondrous beyond the imaginings of those he will meet but can its potency match that of the churchs most closely guarded treasure for centuries it has lain dormant but it is about to be unearthed and the powers that will be unleashed may be beyond anyones capacity to control even a man as extraordinary as benzamir

3599530 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3599531 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3599532 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3599533 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3599534 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter

3599537 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3599538 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3599539 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star

3599542 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3599543 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3599544 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3599545 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3599546 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3599547 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3599548 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3599549 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3599550 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them

3599557 if we find an easy agreement maybe we can finish our discussions but it may take another meeting after that to get together
3599558 we are relying on the understanding of other partners in this effort were asking people to look closely and quickly in the nsg to move expeditiously and we hope that will happen and then well go to the us congress
3599559 were trying to listen to other governments and well have a more complete discussion later this month with the other nuclear suppliers
3599560 now that india has told us theyre ready to move forward were determined to move as far as we can as quickly as we can
3599561 we also talked a lot about india we talked about the india civil nuclear initiative that the united states has taken and how were working with other governments now first at the iaea in vienna where we were able to achieve consensus to move forward on the safeguards agreement
3599562 and now were working and talking to other countries in the nsg
3599563 and so as we approach a group meeting in the nsg weve tried to make sure that we listened to key countries that we talked to key countries and japan is certainly one of them
3599564 a lot of very different discussions both on the non proliferation aspects of the agreement and the cooperation with india where i think it is important to bring in india alongside the international non proliferation effort
3599565 about the bigger picture of our relationships with india and how those are improving and changing and how this agreement fits in that context as well
3599566 we think those are important things to be discussed but we also think that those issues and questions that can be raised do indeed have good answers solid answers because in the end this agreement contributes to non proliferation
3599567 it contributes to clean energy for indias economic development and it contributes to indias relationship with the rest of the world
3599568 dont damage public property this is our own property and we should not make any attempt to damage it

3599570 the situation was slipping out of hand and the police had to open fire in which at least two people mohammad maqbool and abdul aziz were killed a few others were injured
3599571 as much as we have given the eastern people their right to own land we will soon ensure that northern people would be free to do likewise
3599572 the meeting will finalise a notification on this and the prime minister will later announce it during his address to the nation on independence day aug 15

3599584 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3599585 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3599586 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3599587 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3599588 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3599589 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3599590 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3599591 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3599592 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3599593 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens

3599597 the unreal is the paris britney obama glam rock nonsense the latest example of which is
3599598 the more team mccain does this as much as it obviously gets their ya yas out the more they demean their candidate
3599599 this country faces immense issues and it is not a time for insipid parodies and you know what the american people understand it and they want more from the men who are asking for their vote to be president of the united states so the mccain frat boys can act out as much as they want
3599600 the unreal is thinking that obama has peaked in the high 40s in virtually all the polls but not understanding that it is mccain who may have peaked in the low 40s where he has been stuck in virtually all the polls
3599601 what is real is race the industrial states and commander in chief
3599602 this election brings us into new territory the country has never gone through this before
3599603 you ask americans where georgia is and they think it is somewhere near atlanta
3599604 so the handwringers are wailing that we are only slightly up in august but guess what we are up in august and we will still peak in late october
3599605 hey you got sms in australia we want to text you on the vp the moment barack makes his decision as we told our troops
3599606 thanks for giving me an excuse to sip the belvedere love taos and santa fe chill baby
3599607 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3599608 to elsie i think that we do not have a real good choice with either candidate but i fail to see how you think obama will help with our moral decline as he apparently is a strong supporter of abortion and gay rights
3599609 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3599610 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3599611 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3599612 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3599613 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3599614 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3599615 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3599616 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3599617 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3599618 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3599619 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3599620 a couple of lawyers have already been taken in the police are on television and the interim administrations information spokesman is warning people
3599621 obviously what they are doing is targeting the people who are strongly opposed to the charter
3599622 it is happening it is not some imaginary story it is occurring there is no question about that
3599623 the secretary general appeals for restraint protection of all civilians as well as access for the provision of speedy humanitarian assistance to the affected population
3599624 seven villages have been cleared and well clear eight more today
3599625 the red cross has finally been able to get in were preparing to feed 85 000 people for the next five days
3599626 we are the only ones there other than the government
3599627 some evacuation centres are cramped and they may be fearing that if the centres are bombed they will all be hit
3599628 there were multiple complex gunshot wound sic on the left face surrounding the left eye base of nose upper cheek and forehead with laceration and blackening of the skin
3599629 burning and blackening is a feature of very close range shots probably from less than a foot away if you see burning and soot type burning it indicates that the barrel of the gun was very close to the skins surface
3599630 satellite shaped gunshot wound on the back of the head centrally located
3599631 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3599632 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3599633 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3599634 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3599635 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3599636 i have spent 12 years working at this school and this is by far the best condition it has ever been in
3599637 other school managers are also very impressed and many are looking to have renovations done to their schools now as well
3599638 the classrooms used to be overcrowded but now there are more more children are going to be able to gain a proper education thanks to both expansion of classrooms and addition of new ones
3599639 work began in april during operation marne piledriver and was officially completed today
3599640 the contractor both met and exceeded the scope of work for the project
3599641 having a better school gives the students a sense of pride in their education
3599642 the students see that we are doing something good for them and they will hopefully embrace positive things
3599643 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3599644 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3599645 if that is the case and we have humanitarian access australia as always will be in there through the appropriate international agencies including the red cross to provide practical humanitarian help
3599646 australians expect our government always to be out there with a helping hand when people are in need and there are something like a hundred thousand displaced persons im advised in this particular war zone in georgia
3599647 we australia do stand to render any assistance if that will help in terms of ceasefire and also in terms of humanitarian assistance because we do have regrettably very many displaced people
3599648 we will give serious consideration to anything we can do on the humanitarian front
3599649 there are indications that georgia asked a range of nation states including australia to consider military assistance
3599650 australia indicated at officials levels that we werent interested in providing military assistance
3599651 she is meeting with the apy leaders to progress the 25 million housing deal
3599652 assess the options for establishing more effective governance on the apy lands
3599653 we pattern last years tax returns and have a look at where the pattern of claims are starting to shift in a way that looks out of kilter
3599654 we are seeing the claims around self education for nurses on the rise also what they are claiming as self education
3599655 home office expenses computers laptops pdas these kind of things werent on the radar 10 years ago
3599656 where we do write to people the average reduction in the claim in the next year is 15 per cent so we are not bad at getting the targeting right ms granger said
3599657 we are closing the loop if you like between wealthy individuals and the entities they control
3599658 we are looking to approach that in a far more sophisticated and holistic manner
3599659 looking to fiscal 2009 conditions remain challenging but we expect earnings growth for the sixth consecutive year
3599660 the outcome was very pleasing in the light of financial market turmoil that resulted in slowing initial public offerings and merger and acquisition activity and substantial falls in northern hemisphere interest rates
3599661 the group has however witnessed increased activity in the capital reorganisation arena with a number of large rights issues and dividend reinvestment plans undertaken or announced
3599662 in light of limited seating capacity the places in the public viewing room will be allocated on a first come first served basis
3599663 it may have been that the previous government who set this process in train decided it was going to be easier to be overruled by the wto to demonstrate that its case couldnt stand rather than take the decision itself
3599664 but this is a case where on the surface it looks like we have tried to use the system to obstruct entry of new zealand apples
3599665 the panel should refrain from considering the substance of new zealands claims in this dispute
3599666 when russia moved in on georgia john mccain stood up immediately and told them to get out
3599667 so he is really the man for the job at this critical time in world history
3599668 i respect senator obamas views and i believe that its important that we act in a bipartisan fashion now
3599669 not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent
3599670 i will take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3599671 its time to hear the roar of a strong american economy again and stop john mccain from shipping our jobs overseas
3599672 i believe they are the heartland of america and the judeo christian values they hold are the strength of america
3599673 and they are the reason that the people of georgia are looking to america
3599674 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3599675 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3599676 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3599677 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3599678 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3599679 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3599680 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3599681 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3599682 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3599683 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3599684 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3599685 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3599686 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3599687 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3599688 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3599689 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3599690 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3599691 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3599692 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3599693 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3599694 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3599695 just so you all know we did set a record
3599696 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3599697 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3599698 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3599699 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3599700 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3599701 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3599702 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3599703 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
3599704 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
3599705 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
3599706 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
3599707 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
3599708 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
3599709 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
3599710 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
3599711 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
3599712 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
3599713 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
3599714 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
3599715 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
3599716 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
3599717 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak
3599718 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3599719 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3599720 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3599721 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3599722 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3599723 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3599724 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3599725 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3599726 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3599727 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3599728 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3599729 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3599730 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3599731 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3599732 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3599733 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3599734 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3599735 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3599736 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3599737 it looks like its going slow but theres a lot of torque generated which can make the gears go faster
3599738 on the low end 30 mph wind could generate about 500 watts
3599739 when he was growing up i was cleaning up his room and i remember finding this thing that looked like a bomb
3599740 i dont know how he learned but he knows how
3599741 he knows how to build everything hes always on the computer reading about how things work
3599742 he first got interested in physics and then when we went to louisiana he got interested in meteorology
3599743 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3599744 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
3599745 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3599746 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
3599747 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
3599748 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3599749 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3599750 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3599751 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3599752 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3599753 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3599754 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3599755 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3599756 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3599757 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3599758 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3599759 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3599760 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3599761 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3599762 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3599763 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3599764 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3599765 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3599766 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3599767 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3599768 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3599769 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
3599770 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
3599771 im not surprised to see bolt doing so well for the sheer fact that i worked with him while in training i pushed him very hard and he did the same for me which resulted in me running a season opener of 10 07s he is very competitive in that aspect
3599772 he can be very optimistic about winning three gold medals in beijing i am a bit unsure about the relay but they have two of the fastest men in the world on the same team that could be a recipe for success or disaster well have to wait and see
3599773 if bolt holds his head then yes he can break the world record again and i believe he can run it in 9 60 odd he has already run 9 72 looking easy so 9 60 odd is well within his grasp
3599774 in the 200m he can get close to the record he can run 19 40s i believe it all depends on if he stays relaxed a lot of things can happen at an olympics and people can start losing their minds he has shown throughout the season that he can keep is head but grand prixs and championships are two different things
3599775 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
3599776 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
3599777 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
3599778 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
3599779 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
3599780 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
3599781 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
3599782 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
3599783 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
3599784 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
3599785 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
3599786 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
3599787 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
3599788 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
3599789 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that
3599790 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3599791 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3599792 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3599793 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3599794 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3599795 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3599796 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3599797 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3599798 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3599799 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3599800 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3599801 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3599802 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3599803 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3599804 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3599805 creo que tengo que volver a afeitarme para tener la oportunidad de hacer una carrera perfecta a ana

3599809 creo que el p blico chino estar orgulloso de m porque he tra do a un gran equipo
3599810 the reign of charlemagne was greatly aided by a general improvement in the weather during the eight and ninth centuries
3599811 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
