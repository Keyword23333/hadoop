8700011 you pick up on the energy of your surroundings its much more like my old job i can really loosen up
8700012 its original its suspenseful the writers chris mcquarrie and nathan alexander are just great and i cant say enough good things about the director bryan singer i first met him at the mission impossible premiere and weve been hoping to work together ever since
8700013 i have to be very sincere the person that makes me feel very happy also because she chose vintage was julia roberts in erin brockovich when she got the academy award

8700022 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8700023 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing

8700025 i say that slightly tongue in cheek but its true
8700026 i just think he doesnt have the temperament to be president

8700031 revealed 8 million victims in the worlds biggest cyber heist
8700032 basically the herald elicited a statement from us on one issue and used the statement to report on another
8700033 the general rule is that one should not disclose the breach until its scope has been determined

8700039 i understand there are a few other people using facebook pages under my name which i find more flattering than creepy but this is me
8700040 i dont know how i can prove that but feel free to test me
8700041 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page
8700042 actually it was started by my researcher ian reichbach because my grandmother has more internet savvy than i do and shes been dead for 33 years
8700043 its not entirely clear whether he wants to create a movie about the creators of facebook boring or the actual users of the service more boring but neither sound like a good idea
8700044 well unless you want to watch developers do their thing for an hour and a half
8700045 i know of no evidence that comets can break into 100 or 1000 pieces
8700046 festival was apparently a nearly flawless success and there is the general agreement that movies will be a permanent fixture at the plaza once again
8700047 i dont know who coined that but its one of the funniest things ive ever heard
8700048 but im just saying how much more foresighted would it have been for him to have made a suprise appearance at the new york delgation or one of his top people or he could have even sent sen biden
8700049 these are the kinds of political strategies that can diffuse a situation like that
8700050 i dont know if i ever thought id really see it

8700058 this prohibition applies to torture and to any other measures of brutality whether applied by civilian or military agents
8700059 no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
8700060 all persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity
8700061 we will make of these detainees parasites in their societies and we will not release them until they become like mummies empty and full of holes from inside like swiss cheese
8700062 i was shackled in iron cuffs that entered my flesh and a bag was put on my head as a certain music roared in my ears and almost deafened me they used to beat me up and kick me and my body was full of wounds and bruises after that i was sent to a doctor who asked me if i was tortured and i said yes but he didnt reply or say something then i was taken back and tortured again
8700063 the use of certain interrogation methods by the israel security agency isa involving the use of moderate physical pressure was illegal as it violated constitutional protection of the individuals right of dignity while recognizing the right of israel to protect its citizens from violence it reiterates that no exceptional circumstances may be invoked as justification of torture
8700064 the use of torture in israeli interrogations and works for its complete prohibition
8700065 how common is the phenomenon of beating shackled palestinian prisoners
8700066 unfortunately i want to admit something that we are not fully aware of these cases are not all that exceptional in their quantity to my great regret many of them are not the subject of any complaint and are cloaked in various kinds of conspiracies of silence
8700067 moral legal and practical gravity to examine how those responsible address it to clarify its absolute prohibition under israeli and international law and to demand
8700068 by providing the relevant bodies with useful information and tools
8700069 only metal devices are to be used and the tightening of the shackles should be undertaken to prevent injury to the detainee particularly to blood vessels
8700070 i was put in a small room and they beat my legs they put me on the floor then i felt one of the soldiers take something from the floor and beat me on my head and shoulders then they took me out into a concrete yard and tied my handcuffs to a concrete pole and made me sit on the ground and they beat me every hour or half hour they would beat me on the face
8700071 assault identification of explosives scouting weapons and ammunition searches or rescue and release
8700072 neutralize and attack hostile elements seizes a subject and wont let go
8700073 race colour sex language religion political or other opinion national ethnic or social origin property disability birth or other status
8700074 grave consequences of this action can be anticipated in advance
8700075 how can it be that these events keep repeating themselves and no one is bothered and this is the morality of the idf these are the most basic values to which soldiers should be educated from the start it isnt about palestinians its about normative behavior the most basic things how a soldier in the idf can commit such abusive acts it comes down to some kind of disregard for the lives of palestinians
8700076 criminal phenomenon subject to penalties under an entire system of offenses in israeli criminal law
8700077 given this reality it is hardly surprising that an examination of the actual behavior of the military as distinct from its declarations also reveals denial evasion and obfuscation
8700078 when you deny thousands of people a day free movement it is impossible to do it in a nice way
8700079 tangible objectives for securing a drastic reduction in as short a period of time as possible toward the ultimate goal of completely eradicating this phenomenon
8700080 coalition of israeli palestinian and international ngos united against the practice of torture and ill treatment in israel and the occupied palestinian territories opt
8700081 torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
8700082 to various stakeholders in israel and the opt including the eu tel aviv delegation ecd european commission technical assistance office for the west bank and gaza ectao eu ambassadors and or other relevant eu contact persons in eu missions and ngos particularly active in this field
8700083 the eu and its member states contribute to the prevention and eradication of torture
8700084 combat ing impunity to hold perpetrators liable establish ing reporting procedures and provid ing reparation and rehabilitation for victims
8700085 if there is something all humanity can agree on at least theoretically it is that preserving individual dignity in difficult situations requires that we all conform to some elementary common standards of conduct
8700086 there shall be no violation of the life body or dignity of any person all persons are entitled to protection
8700087 there shall be no deprivation or restriction of the liberty of a person by imprisonment arrest extradition or otherwise
8700088 israeli law has abolished the death penalty for murder and corporal punishment
8700089 fundamental human rights founded upon recognition of the value of the human being the sanctity of human life and the principle that all persons are free
8700090 to protect human life dignity and assure that all government authorities are bound to respect these rights under this basic law
8700091 officially proclaimed a state of public emergency from 19 may 1948 four days after its founding until the present day
8700092 due to the ongoing state of war or violent conflict between israel and its neighbours and the attendant attacks on the lives and property of its citizens
8700093 from torture and other forms of ill treatment or punishment may not be violated under any circumstances and states of emergency
8700094 in the context of the arrest and interrogation of persons suspected of being security threats
8700095 israels sensitivity in dealing with human rights issues and the problem of torture and ill treatment makes any dialogue on these matter particularly slow and complex
8700096 may become overly reluctant to raise such issues systematically consistently and firmly notwithstanding their legal and political duty to put human rights in the centre of their foreign and security policy
8700097 apparently not the subject of torture and ill treatment given the political realities in israel and the opt progress in preventing and eradicating torture and ill treatment must be regarded as a mid and long term goal
8700098 there is never a good moment to raise human rights questions and always a reason for not doing something
8700099 strongly and consistently promot ing full compliance with basic and absolute legal obligations to protect individuals most fundamental rights
8700100 financial assistance to civil society actors in israel and the opt

8700160 obama is drawing inspiration from three past convention speeches those of bill clinton in 1992 ronald reagan in 1980 and john f kennedy in 1960
8700161 succeed here and obamas speech will be remembered as one of the most powerful moments in modern politics a perfect launch into the final stage of the general election fail and obama risks fueling republicans criticism that he is an aloof celebrity fond of speaking to big crowds but incapable of forming genuine connections
8700162 they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary
8700163 i was reminded of all of this after a great studio visit last night werein there was actual discussion of serious ideas these things exist in austin and probablly happen more than we know how we make them more plentiful and accessible is just one of the questions that need to be asked
8700164 that if a mans faith is sincere it is the most important thing about him and that it is impossible to understand who he is and how he will lead without first understanding the religious vision that informs his life
8700165 it came about as a choice and not an epiphany the questions i had did not magically disappear but kneeling beneath that cross on the south side of chicago i felt gods spirit beckoning me i submitted myself to his will and dedicated myself to discovering his truth
8700166 christianity is but one religious tree rooted in the common ethical soil of all human experience
8700167 with the speechs tone of moderation its welcome of faith into the public square and yet its insistence that people of faith conduct themselves in public debate according to democratic values it became what obama had intended a call to reform a redefinition of religions role in american political life soon his words were debated on cable news programs heard by tens of thousands on youtube and argued fiercely on web sites from every political perspective

8700186 in choosing not to support any of the candidates in assembly district 64 citizens union decided that while speaker silver had been a champion on such important reform issues like campaign finance and same day voter registration he needed to embrace and advance a broader agenda of reform issues that included a nonpartisan redistricting commission greater transparency in and public scrutiny of the decisions that are made by the assembly and strengthening state legislative ethics rules in the areas of financial disclosure and conflicts of interest citizens union feels that he has well represented his district in spite of having the additional responsibility of being the assembly speaker and has been helpful to the needs of new york city in key ways like education funding one of his challengers was a compelling candidate paul newell who had a good grasp of the issues but had not been able to demonstrate that he had broad community support for his election
8700187 steeped in 80s era references rick springfield cassettes duran duran posters and anais anais perfume anyone the flashback elements of lilys life are breezy reliably tacky fun but unexpected moments of tenderness give the story heart
8700188 dunns deft sense of pacing and her old fashioned niceness make
8700189 in addition to being an impressive treasure trove of cultural references both high and frequently low jancee dunn is also a tenderhearted novelist dont you forget about me is wistful graceful and seriously funny powells com
8700190 i loved this book from start to finish jancee dunn is a wonderful storyteller
8700191 hilarious you wont be able to keep from reading the whole thing
8700192 the ultimate beach read for the person who likes their pop culture served with a side of smarts
8700193 i want that but i dont want that because i dont need it actually i cant handle it im going to change
8700194 as the station is configured today theres nowhere to put all the international partner modules until we deliver and activate harmony thats the piece that makes the rest possible
8700195 this is an enormous piece of hardware i believe on the order of 35 000 pounds 15 880 kg so very precise robotic flying is involved for the crew inside and a lot of coordination between the spacewalkers and them
8700196 our flight as all the flights that are happening right now is really important for the build up of the international space station
8700197 the team feels like were in a very good place to go fly on thursday
8700198 were all thinking that thursdays the day regardless of what the weather guy might tell ya
8700199 its been compressed but weve also taken account that the crew thats currently onboard there is just performing out of their socks
8700200 theyre doing incredible work at a rate that the dreamers wouldnt have come up with let alone the planners
8700201 were kind of hoping that that will rub off on the shuttle crew
8700202 the gouge goes pretty much through the entire thickness of the tile
8700203 i dont have any idea whether a repair will be required
8700204 my understanding is this tile damage is not an issue of the safety of the crew its more of an issue of the ability to reuse the orbiter and damaging the orbiter we still have analysis ongoing we still might choose to repair it
8700205 i hope they know they are here with us in our hearts
8700206 the grapple fixture is basically a big pin that the robot arm can grab onto and then pull the columbus module out of the payload bay
8700207 it could be launched with it on there the only problem is its a little bit too big to fit into the payload bay with the grapple fixture on
8700208 at that point i think therell be lots of celebrations in europe
8700209 this will be the first time europe will have a permanent base in space
8700210 we hope that this first participation will help in reinforcing our technical expertise and our experience of operations to be able to go further and participate with the future of space exploration
8700211 were disappointed that were not flying wed love to fly but we want to fly safe and its not believed to be safe at the moment
8700212 our hope is that we can go do some trouble shooting and nail down what part of the system the failure might be in
8700213 its not that big of an impact to us overall
8700214 theres enough margin that can accommodate this move into january
8700215 i would like to fly as soon as practical but more than that i would like to fix this problem
8700216 we need to get to the bottom of this once and for all
8700217 later join mei and i at 1u around 3pm ok

8700219 even a modest sized telescope there will outperform anything you can put on the ground
8700220 as a scientist i have a keen interest in exploring the entire solar system and indeed the far inner regions inside of venus and even mercury
8700221 neossat may indeed contribute to our knowledge of extremely interior asteroids and in that light i look forward to what it may find
8700222 to see 2 metre high shatter cones on the side of the road took my breath away
8700223 who knows how many hundreds of thousands of people had driven by there without recognising them
8700224 yet ns will be the first ones to bitch about some corporate business practices that supposedly affect consumers
8700225 the kinetic energy of the impact is just off the scale by anything humans can relate to
8700226 its a very dynamic situation rocks act more like fluids than rocks
8700227 its almost like mixing in some compost into a garden the further you work it into the soil the better you make it for the organisms
8700228 within the basin youd have had a magma ocean it would have been easily several tens of kilometres deep
8700229 outside the basin you would have had a tremendous amount of ejecta raining back down on the surface
8700230 it also means that atmospheric pressure on northern surfaces is higher than in the south encouraging winds there to scour the surface more than in the opposite hemisphere as a result it seems likely that more dust has been blown from north to south than the other way
8700231 the foraminifera were deliberately using extraterrestrial diamonds in their shells
8700232 he also took up a collection and sent it to jerusalem to provide for a sin offering for if he were not expecting that those who had fallen asleep would arise again it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray for the dead therefore he made atonement for the dead that they might be delivered from their sin
8700233 ostensibly historical but actually quite imaginative are the books of tobit judith susanna and bel and the dragon which may be called moralistic novels
8700234 normally at conventions youd have people regaling you with what happened the night before
8700235 this time not a single person has given me a story i guess when you lose two elections in a row people learn from that
8700236 theres a sense that the parties are completely detached from the populist excitement that undergirds obamas appeal
8700237 the one thing that democrats have learned is that if anyone can lose an election its the democrats
8700238 in the last eight years weve become a lot more respectful of the republican political machine
8700239 theres still a lot of apprehension and maybe nervousness about what actually may happen on election day
8700240 a sense of fulfillment in the air that at the same time doesnt allow anyone to take anything for granted
8700241 as you enjoy all the events that denver and the convention have to offer please monitor yourself
8700242 and remember that drinks may go to your head faster than youre used to in new york
8700243 we now have evidence that the composition is similar to our kuiper belt
8700244 the more percussive her pianism becomes the more she opens up a song and reimagines it in what might be called a romantic carnival groove
8700245 i talked to the team about us setting up for the 31st launch
8700246 they told us that they were ready for us to go fly
8700247 for a backup emergency system that has a low probability of use you will take a lower reliability of that component
8700248 it has the reliability that we think it needs for a backup system
8700249 i think its a small price to pay for all the improvement that were getting on this tank
8700250 its a much much better tank than we were flying pre columbia it just took a little extra time
8700251 i can hardly believe this time has come its been an amazing adventure
8700252 the station really is something straight out of science fiction when you take a look around its just really impressive that weve pulled this off
8700253 theres actually enough space so that you can lose people you can go from stem to stern trying to find somebody and not find them thats how big this place is
8700254 this mission is a crucial step to kibo total assembly
8700255 clearly having a working toilet is a priority for us

8700257 its my firm belief that its a mistake to hold firm beliefs
8700258 making a video of earth from so far away helps the search for other life bearing planets in the universe by giving insights into how a distant earth like alien world would appear to us
8700259 to image earth in a similar fashion an alien civilisation would need technology far beyond what earthlings can even dream of building
8700260 the video will help us connect a varying point of planetary light with underlying oceans continents and clouds and finding oceans on extrasolar planets means identifying potentially habitable worlds
8700261 a sun glint can be seen in the movie caused by light reflected from earths oceans and similar glints to be observed from extrasolar planets could indicate alien oceans
8700262 the national federation of the blind is pleased to have reached a settlement with target that is good for all blind consumers and we recognize that target has already taken action to make certain that its web site is accessible to everyone
8700263 we look forward to working with target in the coming months to help make additional improvements that will enhance the experience of blind visitors to target com it is our sincere hope that other businesses providing goods and services over the internet will follow targets example
8700264 we are pleased to have reached an agreement with the nfb regarding the accessibility of target com for individuals who use assistive technologies and will work with the nfb on further refinements to our web site
8700265 what can we do with our castle our church our collection
8700266 showed there would be no danger at all to the underlying structure
8700267 i am cautiously optimistic that repair will not be needed
8700268 there was no issue with leakage but this is a precautionary measure we do
8700269 the hole does not constitute a risk to the crew it is not expected to cause any damage to the vehicle structure
8700270 you have something you know you can live with why would you take the risk of the spacewalk to change that
8700271 everything has to go exactly right for us to make the 24th
8700272 if the problem is where we think it is this will solve that
8700273 the preponderance of evidence in my mind says that we have an acceptable risk to go fly
8700274 from the kennedy perspective were ready to go and looking forward to next week
8700275 europe in the past has been a strong player in manned spaceflight and that is without question
8700276 but this now has all of a sudden changed columbus will stay our property our flight control center will control columbus we have the right to do experiments around the clock when we have a new idea we can bring it up and research it in our own lab
8700277 if we had kept the same assembly sequence we could be launching in 2008 or 2009 and that was not going to work for us because our taxpayers were becoming increasingly nervous
8700278 this will be a tremendous step we are becoming a more important partner for the international spaceflight community
8700279 we never had a permanent base in space before and i see that like a first step for europe in the real spaceflight activities compared to what we had in the past
8700280 lift off of space shuttle atlantis as columbus sets sail on a voyage of science to the space station
8700281 we finally will have our own real estate on orbit
8700282 the teams on earth are still looking at the information gathered on sunday and are expected to decide by tomorrow if more tests are needed
8700283 if a repair is needed it will probably take place on one of the two remaining spacewalks still planned and if we do need to do a repair we have all the tools needed to do that
8700284 we had another crew cabin leak check and it went fine i think that problems behind us
8700285 between having to work that problem and the weather hasnt been good to us at all its tightened up the schedule
8700286 the weather has been kind to us so weve been fortunate to not get behind
8700287 overall weather is looking really good for this time of year in florida
8700288 we could not do this flight if we had a person as a crew member that was just dedicated to education
8700289 barbara is a fully functional member of this crew and we need her to do space shuttle stuff
8700290 this is not a catastrophic loss of orbiter case at all
8700291 this is a case where you want to do the prudent thing for the vehicle
8700292 the leak has been isolated its a pressure relief valve behind the toilet in the crew cabin
8700293 in the past we didnt even know we had damage and we flew back home
8700294 to imply that my crew or i would ever consider launching on our mission in anything but the best possible condition is utterly ridiculous
8700295 were confident its going to work but it will be a good double check to make sure everythings in the proper configuration
8700296 the 2010 date was really an arbitrary date that was really picked more by omb the us office of management and budget than nasa
8700297 the risk of flying the shuttle does not increase overnight obviously theres risk and nasa is doing its best to mitigate it the risk is worth the goals we set out
8700298 flying the space shuttle past 2010 would carry significant risks particularly to our efforts to build and purchase new transportation systems that are less complex less expensive to operate and better suited to serving both the space station and exploration missions to the moon mars and beyond
8700299 sometimes your students are the only ones crazy enough to believe in you
8700300 superbly articulated on a par with autobiography of a face or girl interrupted
8700301 there is an art in nonfiction but the art isnt the creative license one might take as a fiction writer rather it comes from digging deeply researching exhaustively writing in a way that makes it seem as if it is fiction but is founded in the most reliable of reportage and research
8700302 still the engineering and safety teams believe theres absolutely no risk at all during re entry
8700303 its been a great mission but all good things come to an end
8700304 we faced some adversity together but the problems were overcome and the mission was a success
8700305 everybody on ground worked very hard all day all night with us together because we are one big crew everybody now we would like to say good bye shuttle have a good safe landing
8700306 we still have not found a smoking gun about what caused it
8700307 im sad to say good bye but that means progress in being made and its time for the international space station to grow a little more
8700308 the mindset is were going to land you safely someplace today
8700309 it was disclosed to us as soon as the event occurred about a week and a half ago
8700310 the damage is very obvious easy to detect its not a mystery to us
8700311 if we dont get it repaired in time well fly without it
8700312 its like driving a new car off the showroom floor
8700313 were going to be fighting the same challenges at ksc kennedy space center and at edwards the winds are going to pick up
8700314 still the engineering and safety teams believe theres absolutely no risk at all during re entry
8700315 its nice to have this record at the moment but were really hoping to get some schools on board to break that record in future working with amateurs
8700316 people have suspected that these asteroids with very high rotation speeds exist
8700317 this now pushes us into a new area and hopefully well find something even faster in the future
8700318 this discovery is a great incentive for schools were trying to encourage them to do real science
8700319 i think they can jump on this bandwagon now that the amateurs have opened it up
8700320 yall dont say scuse me when you bumpin into someone the fuck is wrong with yall
8700321 i respect my elders but you a old ass bitch
8700322 im the old bitch look at yo crusty ass thinkin you all that bumpin into someone without sayin e scuse me you the old bitch bitch
8700323 both of you shut the fuck up youre very tough we all know its been established but i just finished working all day im tired and youre being children so shut the fuck up
8700324 you sonned em they get loud you get louder you sonned em king
8700325 he would be a stellar governor hopefully not at my expense because were pretty good friends
8700326 i dont think andrew wants to do that i think he likes what he is doing now
8700327 does andrew want to do something in the future absolutely

8700332 the olympics can inspire people more people will give up smoking less people will become obese

8700345 well hell find what hes looking for then wont he my men are more than capable of taking care of number 6

8700349 i was pinned in between the door and the drivers seat it was slick outside because she was spinning the tires i jumped out of the way the door caught me on my right arm

8700356 she very much is in very critical condition were just hoping and praying she can continue to progress from her injuries
8700357 in small business as in life there are two certainties one is taxes the other is the absolute guarantee that sooner or later a critical hardware or software system will fail leaving your business to muddle through on manual systems
8700358 even if we start drilling today we wont see results for five to seven years
8700359 what the hell was wrong with us to think that we had a right to tell gay people they couldnt get married how could we have been so stupid
8700360 you should pick my daughter because shes made out with a girl before
8700361 as a former journalist and member of the subcommittee on internet and intellectual property h j res 79 should be of importance to the congressman on many levels
8700362 cross ownership would not only diminish independent voices but that of women and people of color who own a very small percentage of stations and newspapers media consolidation affects not only who we see in the media and how they are represented but also who is behind the scenes producing what we see read and hear
8700363 having worked with the media for 28 years as an air force public affairs officer i am very concerned that the quality of journalism has degraded to the point that it is not only misinforming american citizens it has virtually ceased serving as a vital fourth estate
8700364 what if that day of action is followed up by thousands of phone calls and hundreds of thousands of letters what if together we made so much noise that no politician this election year would dare defend another handout to big media

8700384 if our days in the garden of the earth are in reality so uncertain so brief if there is indeed so little time for any of us to play under the blackthorn if indeed as was made clear to me then death cannot be gainsend then surely the secret of so sorry and insecure an existence must lie in detachment for he who would lose his sic heart to a life so beset with tragedy had best have a care for his sic wits
8700385 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal

8700387 do you know petrol will be increased 70 cent after tonight
8700388 lets assume we get soaked to the skin twice a day and also during each night and docs require doubled up socks
8700389 hes got a great sense of humor and he uses it to disarm any volatile issue
8700390 i so admired what he did this morning i believe what he tries to do is use that humor and also use honesty to get across his flaws and joke about it
8700391 we believe a phenomenal opportunity exists for us to become a leader in the local job space utilizing cutting edge technology to connect employers with job seekers our ceo and founder derek chisholm has created a scalable technology platform similar to our local directories that should allow us to enter new markets with relative ease we believe www tampabayjoblistings com will be very well received by floridas largest job market the tampa bay area
8700392 after tampa were targeting launching local job sites in all of floridas major markets by the end of the year and nationally in 2009
8700393 were really trying to be a great start experience for your mobile session
8700394 everything generally speaking is moving toward greater openness and customization
8700395 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8700396 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8700397 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8700398 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8700399 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8700400 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8700401 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8700402 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8700403 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8700406 planned on bringing him back to the hotel when we responded to their found pet ad
8700407 they dont belong on our property they dont belong in our doorways
8700408 employees are afraid to show up to work because they have homeless sleeping in the doorways its just becoming an obnoxious problem
8700409 its not getting rid of the problem its just sort of pushing it over somewhere else
8700410 maybe they should spend their money more effectively and sponsor a homeless shelter on the eastside
8700411 they dont want to have to deal with the city issues or sleeping with other people or waiting in lines for food
8700412 if youre interested in getting kids more fit and active then vote for sports4kids project
8700413 theres no vulnerabilities no protocol errors there are no software problems the problem arises from the level of interconnectivity thats needed to maintain this mess to keep it all working
8700414 they simply dont because it takes work and to do sufficient filtering to prevent these kinds of attacks on a global scale is cost prohibitive
8700415 its a huge issue its at least as big an issue as the dns issue if not bigger
8700416 i went around screaming my head about this about ten or twelve years ago we described this to intelligence agencies and to the national security council in detail
8700417 maar meneer ik zie dat u ook een creditcard hebt u gebruikt die met een royaalpakket terwijl een betaalpakket veel goedkoper is
8700418 u betaalt nu 32 50 per jaar voor uw pakket en met het betaalpakket gaat u slechts 31 95 betalen maar daar staan dus al die voordelen tegenover ik kan dat meteen voor u in orde maken
8700419 maar ik heb dit jaar al 32 50 betaald en als ik nu op uw aanbieding inga moet ik dus nog eens 31 95 erbij betalen in plaats van voordeel ga ik dus dit jaar voor 31 95 de boot in met uw geweldige aanbieding dank u de koekoek
8700420 they were so good at what they did it was difficult watching surveillance video to even tell what they were doing
8700421 they could be walking down an aisle looking at items with one hand and stealing with the other hand
8700422 lighter fluid and clorox used to clean packages glue guns and irons used to repackage items and shrink wrap machines used to package items for shipment
8700423 they didnt have any knowledge that those items were stolen
8700424 this adds up to serious dollars and unfortunately the consumer pays the price
8700425 we dont want to make an unfriendly shopping environment for our customers
8700426 but when youre losing more than youre selling you have to do something
8700427 youre starting to see a very big and coordinated effort between retail and law enforcement really waging war on organized retail crime
8700428 we are profoundly shocked and saddened by the tragic loss of our colleague pierre
8700429 pierre was a talented young scholar who joined the vanderbilt faculty in 2006 in his relatively brief time at vanderbilt he earned the respect of his colleagues and students and his absence will be profoundly felt he was a kind and gentle person and a devoted colleague mentor and friend
8700430 i used to think that if none of your family or friends knew you were dead it was like not really being dead people can invent the best and the worst for you
8700431 people are into style into how they and their clothes look why not be into the pc they carry
8700432 who like to attract attention and show off in their facebook photos
8700433 im not sure scent is on the top of many oem to do lists but asus has innovated a few things that others have looked into before
8700434 our goal is to eventually reach 80 of the native mips performance
8700435 right now we are at 40 so we have a long way to go
8700436 why would they set a target they dont think they can achieve that would only embarrass them
8700437 what china wants to do is develop its own technologies so that its manufacturers arent dependent on paying licenses and other fees to other countries
8700438 if you chose to continue windows xp sp3 and ie8 beta 2 will become permanent

8700441 veoh has simply established a system whereby software automatically processes user submitted content and recasts it in a format that is readily accessible to its users
8700442 veoh does not itself actively participate or supervise the uploading of the files nor does it preview or select the files before the upload is completed instead files are uploaded through an automated process which is initiated entirely at the volition of veohs users
8700443 this ruling suggests that youtube is also protected by the dmca safe harbors just as many had stated from the beginning
8700444 the key issues raised by lo and also raised by viacom is that these sites lose their dmca safe harbors because they take action on the content often transcoding the content from one format into flash however the judge in the veoh case trashed that argument pretty easily
8700445 youtube has said 13 hours of video content is uploaded every minute on youtube
8700446 if its impossible for veoh to monitor all content youtube is going to have an order of magnitude larger problem if you take reasonable precautions against copyrighted materials on your service you may be ok
8700447 i dont know why you ever would lie to me
8700448 why do things work out much better than i can possibly dream or imagine
8700449 aslan told us to do this those were his words he never said what would happen if we did these things
8700450 tell me about this real world what is a sun describe it to me how quaint it is all your imagination it never existed
8700451 you can tell us all you want that the real world doesnt exist and that it is all our imagination but if so our imagination beats your real world a thousand fold and whether our world narnia is real or not i am leaving

8700469 the eucharist and the presence of the body and blood of christ is in my mind an overwhelming experience for me i find that communion for me is empowering its almost a feeling of a kind of high
8700470 i find it mind boggling that with nearly 70 percent of americans describing themselves as christians and witnessing the success of the passion of the christ and the chronicles of narnia that hollywood still doesnt do the kinds of faith based and family value entertainment that people are desperate to see

8700522 i had to be consistent and try to get a high percentage of my first serves in
8700523 i didnt return so well and i had a lot of ups and downs and big frustrations
8700524 but it is the first match it is always the trickiest one but hopefully the next one will be better
8700525 after it happened i was thinking more of it than i was the pain so it is not really a big deal
8700526 but in a certain moment i felt big pain so i had to get it taped
8700527 i felt good thats the best ive felt in four five months
8700528 i was really disappointed the way he had served the point before he served right at me for sure

8700531 i was advised that as the chief secretary and the director general of police would file detailed counter affidavits i should adopt their counter affidavits however out of respect for this court i have now decided to submit a separate counter affidavit while adopting the facts stated in the affidavits of chief secretary and the dgp
8700532 i made it clear at that time that the fast was not against the supreme court order and the fast undertaken by political parties should not in any way affect the general public or hinder their routine life
8700533 malign me and the present government with false and exaggerated statements to make out a case of contempt of this court the facts narrated will establish that i have not only not violated the order passed by this court but i have ordered its implementation
8700534 i regret the delay in submitting this counter affidavit the delay is neither wilful nor wanton nor due to any disrespect to the orders of this court
8700535 there is no contempt in the speech made by me nor was it violative of the order passed by this court on september 30 2007 whatever i have said on that occasion was a legitimate exercise of the freedom of speech
8700536 there was absolutely no likelihood of any harm or injury to the administration of justice and it was only a fair criticism and expression of the factual situation

8700538 when you talk of steam people think you are going backwards
8700539 but anywhere where you are wasting a lot of heat we can go in capture the heat and turn it into energy savings steam has tremendous power if it can drive a steam locomotive why cant it drive an automotive engine

8700546 im very unhappy with the film i never had a chance to do one scene the way it was written or the way i wanted it to be the script wasnt respected bad producers bad partners it was a terrible experience
8700547 its pure violence and stupidity all the action scenes had a goal they were supposed to be driven by either a metaphysical point of view or experience for the characters
8700548 instead parts of the movie are like a bad episode of 24
8700549 having worked with actors for many years i find it hard to believe that anyone would have to be dragged kicking and screaming into showbusiness
8700550 the operation is over with the killing of all three militants
8700551 we have information that there may be more militants so we are taking all the precautions fencing along the international border has been cut so we suspect that the number of militants who had crossed may be much more
8700552 the pact can unlock the potential our economies are growing very strongly and i look forward to greater investment flows between our two entities
8700553 five years ago india itself had not moved so much on further liberalisation when you talk of palm oil a sensitive product for malaysia and indonesia our indias applied rates today on crude oil is zero at that time five years ago our applied rate was 50 per cent or 60 per cent similarly on goods our tariff rates four years ago were 20 25 per cent today our peak tariff rates are an average of 9 7 per cent so time also really helped in this process of negotiation
8700554 this is a very manageable number and as we constantly review the agreement we will try to bring these tariff lines to a smaller number this is five per cent in trade value now

8700566 children it is the last hour and just as you heard that antichrist is coming even now many antichrists have arisen from this we know that it is the last hour they went out from us but they were not really of us for if they had been of us they would have remained with us but they went out in order that it might be shown that they all are not of us
8700567 who is the liar but the one who denies that jesus is the christ this is the antichrist the one who denies the father and the son whoever denies the son does not have the father the one who confesses the son has the father also
8700568 by this you know the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is from god and every spirit that does not confess jesus is not from god and this is the spirit of the antichrist of which you have heard that it is coming and now it is already in the world
8700569 for many deceivers have gone out into the world those who do not acknowledge jesus christ as coming in the flesh this is the deceiver and the antichrist

8700591 the boards most important responsibility is to protect software freedom and to decide the fsfs goals and tactics that means that they are ultimately responsible for the gnu general public license the lgpl agpl and gnu free documentation license for fsf copyright assigned software and manuals and for much of the infrastructure of running the gnu project as a result board members must first and foremost be committed to the cause of software freedom

8700593 richard can be very hands on in relation to a specific target that he needs to be speaking about
8700594 we have a growing membership and we have a view of what we want the membership to be our membership program provides the bulk of our funding but we also want a deeper engagement with out members in the sense that we want them to be activists and we want to be able to provide them with the resources necessary for them to be more effective in this role
8700595 not just out reach out to our members and tell them what were doing but because we get a lot of good ideas from them
8700596 i tend to have close relationships with the campaigns team the licensing expert and the new membership coordinator and have at least weekly conversations with those staff members on particular issues and projects
8700597 we have to work carefully with support from the community and from a very small financial base
8700598 we also have to make sure that we remain coherent with what were doing weve got some chief things wed like to accomplish in the next couple of years but were taking small steps toward them

8700613 has expressed limited support for the rights accorded couples in same sex civil unions
8700614 sen john mccain opposes gay marriage but also is against a constitutional amendment against it he has expressed limited support for the rights accorded couples in same sex civil unions
8700615 apart from opposing a constitutional amendment to ban abortion mccain is against most abortion rights and says he would favor overturning the supreme court decision affirming those rights
8700616 h e has expressed limited support for the rights accorded couples in same sex civil unions
8700617 i believe that states like mine and other states should amend our state constitutions and i will stick to that position until such time if ever a higher court says that my state or another state has to recognize the other stat another status of marriage
8700618 im committed to maintaining the unique status of marriage between man and woman i think it can best be accomplished and in keeping with my federalist philosophy that states should do as much as possible to have that done at the state level but if it is overturned by a superior court i will then obviously support the other path
8700619 a part from opposing a constitutional amendment to ban abortion mccain is against most abortion rights and says he would favor overturning the supreme court decision affirming those rights
8700620 youre for a constitutional amendment banning abortion with some exceptions for life and rape and incest
8700621 so is president bush yet that hasnt advanced in the six years hes been in office what are you going to do to advance a constitutional amendment that president bush hasnt done
8700622 i dont think a constitutional amendment is probably going to take place but i do believe that its very likely or possible that a supreme court should could overturn roe v wade which would then return these decisions to the states which i support im a federalist just as i believe that the issue of gay marriage should be decided by the states so do i believe that we would be better off by having roe v wade returned to the states
8700623 we have to protect the beauty of florida but we also need to have people have the opportunity to drive here and be able to afford to do that too
8700624 we hear that theres new technology we hear there are new processes we hear everything is a lot safer and rather than kind of rush to judgment based on past fears we want to take a close look
8700625 these are people who have been opposed to offshore drilling because they realize how important a clean environment is to our economy
8700626 but at the same time it doesnt help the tourism industry or the state economy to have gasoline prices in excess of 3 50 or 4 per gallon
8700627 weve always made the link that without our products tourism cant exist and operate in a proactive positive way in the state of florida and now i think they understand that in a much more obvious way than ever before
8700628 we are adamantly opposed to it now and in the future
8700629 i just dont see that theres a reward theres no balance between risk and rewards tourism is the no 1 driver of our economy not oil and we just cant take that risk

8700633 we instantly understood how to make a game perfectly balanced for people to have different but completely enjoyable experiences any way they play it
8700634 as long as you start programming the game with the balance board game in mind nintendo was in the loop the whole time with our development
8700635 the day we saw it we were all pretty much rubbing our hands together waiting for someone to give us one so we could see what we could do with it
8700636 within about 2 3 days we already had it hooked up and could stand on it and steer
8700637 it wasnt tuned but right away boom were standing on it and carving around like a skateboard
8700638 the biggest tuning task has been going in a straight line

8700641 the challenge is processing that input in a way that you can figure out what the player is actually trying to do for example one of the characters in audiosurf is able to jump on the track so it seemed like the most natural input from the player was for them to jump themselves

8700656 its located right above the club shop overlooking the 18th green which means you cant live closer to a golf course than this
8700657 and for added appeal it has a pub literally on the doorstep thanks to the local clubhouse as well as plenty of free parking
8700658 but even if you werent a golfer the views are about as spectacular as you could find in edinburgh
8700659 although the interior is in need of a complete renovation there is so much potential here with the right kind of investment you could create a perfect three bedroom home with a golf course for your back garden

8700972 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8700973 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8700974 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8700975 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8701042 obama went thru 20 debates that were more slugfest than tea party
8701043 joe biden is one of the guys that make mccain look like an amateur when it comes to foreign policy and national security
8701044 yes you lost the debate because you couldnt give a good excuse at to why mccain refused to debate obama not once but twice
8701045 one way to encourage young people to volunteer show them the way lead by example
8701046 forcing them to do it may not work too well if there is some trade off for the community service it would probably be more attractive to some
8701047 also forced charity is not charity at all we are a charitable nation but let us do it on our own accord dont tell us what to do
8701048 i wonder how obamas teenage voters will like it when he forces them to perform 50 hours of community service posted by jack
8701049 at least with mccain it would send out a message that having attended an elite ivy school is not a prerequisite to becoming president
8701050 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances
8701051 conclusion obama is smarter more intelligent and has better judgment this is a fact
8701052 maybe his world and his identity dont revolve around him being black
8701053 colin powell is a great man but he is none descript as a black man
8701054 obama is smarter than mccain and this is a fact while obama was topping his class in havard mccain finished among the bottom six in his military class of 900 students
8701055 obama will smoke mccain in any face to face debate any time anywhere and on any topic
8701056 i know that my life is some what easier because of my white skin thats just the way it is but i just dont see how hes basking in his skin color
8701057 maybe if he led by example and proved to the people that it doesnt matter what your skin color is if you are qualified and prepared for the job instead he has played the race card and basked in his color
8701058 interesting fact britney spears set designers built the barakopolis i wonder if barakulus is going to enter invesco flying on wires wearing all leather with a wreath around his head
8701059 his skin color is an issue for a lot of people whether they admit it or not
8701060 roosevelt for example did it with a couple of index cards if that mlk and a zillion other preachers teachers politicians dont use teleprompters
8701061 people who know what youre talking about and or have faith in inspiration dont need somebody elses script to tell them what to say
8701062 oh and every candidate gets a post debate bounce in polls itll be back to even after mccain speaks next week
8701063 who in politics foolish enough to give big speeches without notes
8701064 people say they are color blind until they are faced with a black man being president
8701065 who in politics foolish enough to give big speeches without notes
8701066 thats not change we can believe in hehehehehehe creepy grin
8701067 after last nights big tv show the daily polls are still even why obama cannot close the deal
8701068 heck anyone can hire a good speechwriter and learn how to deliver it smoothly

8701073 is it cool for me to twitter that im about to boff my girlfriend the knee jerk response would be to castigate you for incivility both to your lady friend and your twitter clan such risque tweets will likely skeeve out your girl and followers or make the latter envious neither action should be encouraged but then again twitter is a democracy if users dont like your tweets they can vote with their pcs and drop your feeds so on the off chance your girlfriend is ok with having your coital calender go public and you dont mind losing a few twitter pals feel free to try this out mr know it all is mr less is more in this case and finds your exhibitionism sort of desperate and lame but perhaps your twitter crew is a more swinging bunch

8701164 i had these people who believed in me so much
8701165 every time id come to a point where id begin to indulge in what i should not be indulging in cynicism or skepticism or doubt
8701166 my very cynical friends said it was the only way i could get anyone to sleep with me
8701167 the only goy head of the lchaim society at oxford
8701168 one is after all emboldened by the spectacle of human history in general and american negro history in particular for it testifies to nothing less than the perpetual achievement of the impossible
8701169 the work of our ancestors is not done we must now pay the price and make the sacrifices they made so that our children may dream again
8701170 prove our ancestors right and make the most daring dreamers feel that they have underestimated our potential
8701171 hon st ller samma fr ga om och om igen
8701172 this is a really powerful tool for people to be creative a lot of the stuff that used to be found only in an r amp d laboratory can now sit on your desktop
8701173 that means if you have the knowledge and imagination you dont have tons of capital to make a product
8701174 we could design a 3d printer that would cost less than 500 but you wouldnt have 500 000 consumers who would buy it
8701175 so without a bigger market taking the price down by three quarters or nine tenths doesnt do anything but kill your company
8701176 3d printing is hung up on this high price point
8701177 so i figured lets try to shortcut it take it in its basic form thrust it out to the publics hackers and researchers and realize its true potential
8701178 tokyo is a shining star in the world of cuisine
8701179 we found the citys restaurants to be excellent featuring the best ingredients culinary talents and a tradition passed on from generation to generation and refined by todays chefs
8701180 there are a lot of great cities in the world
8701181 tokyo is an exciting place to eat but paris is an exciting place to eat so is rome
8701182 i dont think it is helpful to make that kind of statement
8701183 tokyo has the best japanese food in the world but it is nowhere near as diverse as other cities
8701184 tokyo ii mise umai mise tokyo good restaurant delicious restaurant
8701185 i think we can call it the culinary capital of the world
8701186 if you try any cuisine its hard to go wrong in tokyo
8701187 you can find many places that are not publicized at all but are still good especially when you are traveling rural europe
8701188 we really didnt know what to expect from the edmonton fringe
8701189 we didnt know if we were going to have tomatoes thrown in our faces or a warm reception or what but its been incredible weve sold out every show
8701190 we modelled a lot of the relationship between abbie and phyl on our own struggles
8701191 when we first met we were both brokenhearted and we were swearing up and down never another relationship
8701192 i have to say its very sexy to go on stage with your husband over and over again and go into the journey of falling in love with one another
8701193 we wanted to tell a cautionary tale so we let our imaginations fly
8701194 we thought if canada does have the second largest supply of oil in the world how long would it take for the americans to get nervous about security theyve already demonstrated that they can invade numerous countries in the world well why not canada
8701195 one of the questions we want to ask is how far will we go before we come to our senses
8701196 the only reason they didnt detonate nuclear bombs underground in alberta in the 50s is that they found oil in alaska that was easier to access
8701197 a lot of them are from newfoundland and i found their sense of humour and their openheartedness really inspiring
8701198 but russell and i talked a lot about the golden handcuffs which is a big issue up there when we asked them the big questions like are you concerned about the environment theyd joke it off or try to avoid the topic and theyve all signed confidentiality agreements these are truck drivers there is a kind of denial that phyl encapsulates
8701199 but what really struck me is that the americans handed him over to the syrians what isnt syria supposed to be evil if theyre evil then why are you working with them cooperating with them everything seems to be about pragmatism actions are generated by specific interests economic political and strategic
8701200 were sort of the good twin but were as messed up as the americans although in less hostile ways
8701201 partly the chorus is just a simple vehicle for exposition
8701202 but the thing about the chorus is that they are able to be commentators they operate at a critical distance so they can convey the information ironically sometimes or with a sense of scientific detachment
8701203 we want to do work thats meaningful to us and were concerned about the future of our planet
8701204 we decided to do the fringe festivals because its difficult to get your own work up otherwise
8701205 es war ein arbeitsreicher tag da wir am auto viele verschiedene einstellungen ausprobiert haben um die balance zu verbessern
8701206 sobald wir mit dem basis set up zufrieden waren haben wir an den bremsen gearbeitet da sie auf diesem kurs sehr beansprucht werden wir haben einige interessante dinge herausgefunden und viel dar ber gelernt wie sich das auto mit wenig abtrieb verh lt die streckenbedingungen waren nicht zu schlecht und recht konstant das ist beim testen immer hilfreich
8701207 das hat uns sehr gefreut da die ingenieure das geplante programm so ohne unterbrechungen durchziehen konnten wir hatten heute eine recht lange aufgabenliste mit aerodynamik anpassungen bremstests und set up arbeiten die ergebnisse sind sehr ermutigend und haben uns f r morgen einen guten weg vorgegeben
8701208 eine leichtere m glichkeit gibts ja gar nicht sie gehen zur bank bergeben der bank ber 300 000 behauptete einzugserm chtigungen und die bank zieht ein ohne dies zu pr fen
8701209 tampons from the dollar store sound scarier than the bear
8701210 yes ive been getting phone calls for him for months
8701211 wir hatten im vergangenen jahr in spa ein gro artiges rennen ich wurde sechster das war eines meiner besten saisonergebnisse
8701212 das wichtigste f r das team ist im moment dass wir herausgefunden haben wo wir den fw30 verbessern k nnen und vor den letzten rennen die n tigen nderungen machen die arbeit die alle zu hause in der fabrik leisten sollte uns in spa weiterhelfen
8701213 wir werden keinen gro en sprung machen aber wir bewegen uns definitiv in die richtige richtung ich freue mich wirklich schon auf den belgien grand prix weil spa eine wunderbare strecke ist es wird schwer werden dort punkte zu holen aber man kann nie vorhersagen was in spa passieren wird deshalb m ssen wir einfach abwarten
8701214 wir werden keinen gro en sprung machen aber wir bewegen uns definitiv in die richtige richtung
8701215 oberste priorit t hat deshalb die strecke kennenzulernen und herauszufinden wie sich das auto auf ihr verh lt
8701216 daher wei ich was f r eine gro artige strecke es ist
8701217 es ist wahrscheinlich eine der tollsten strecken im kalender deshalb freue ich mit schon darauf mit dem fw30 die erste runde dort zu drehen
8701218 eine seiner ganz besonderen eigenheiten sind die fantastischen kurven die durch das wellige gel nde ganz nat rlich geformt wurden f r die fahrer ist es eine echte herausforderung auf dieser l ngsten strecke des kalenders die perfekte runde hinzubekommen
8701219 spa ist eine recht fl ssige strecke auf der die kurven sanft ineinander bergehen
8701220 da es sich um mittelschnelle und schnelle kurven handelt ist eine gute stabilit t des autos gefragt und zeit die man durch fehler am anfang der runde verliert kann man schwer im rundenverlauf wieder wettmachen wichtig ist auch dass das auto so robust ist dass man ber randsteine fahren kann nur so kommt man schnell durch die bus stup schikane
8701221 die berge in der umgebung erzeugen ein eigenes mikro klima und es kann auf einem teil der strecke regenschauer geben w hrend es auf den anderen abschnitten trocken bleibt
8701222 dadurch wird die reifenwahl zu einer zus tzlichen herausforderung die strategen w hlen f r belgien im normalfall eine ein oder zweistoppstrategie und bridgestone bringt die mittlere und die harte reifenmischung mit
8701223 our trip will let you see first hand how these investments have changed spains economy making its businesses more competitive and its people richer while opening up new travel possibilities for spaniards and tourists alike
8701224 we will hear from local leaders about how the systems are developing and what theyve done for spains economic growth and social development
8701225 das waren zwei n tzliche tage in vorbereitung auf monza und spa
8701226 das team und die renault jungs haben einen guten job gemacht am ersten tag konnten wir mehr daten sammeln als heute aber insgesamt war es ein guter test jetzt freue ich mich auf belgien
8701227 actually its not a vodka at all it is the first acai based spirit ive had it and its delicious the best part about it is one of the ingredients prickly pear actually prevents hangovers i know that sounds strange but an alcohol high in antioxidants acai that cures hangovers prickly pear that tastes better than vodka and mixes just the same is a very winning combination

8701230 far more people around the world live in severe poverty than previously thought with the global underclass now numbering an estimated 1 4 billion up from around 1 billion according to a landmark world bank report released yesterday the report does not suggest that the world has suddenly gotten poorer in fact it shows remarkable reductions in poverty levels since the 1980s rather the report represents a revised snapshot of global development using more recent household surveys demographic figures price data and purchasing power analyses the washington post factiva the new figure was estimated after researchers at the bank raised the threshold for extreme poverty from earnings of 1 a day to a new level of 1 25 a day on the back of increased living costs
8701231 the new figures are likely to put fresh pressure on big donor countries to move more aggressively to combat global poverty and on countries to introduce more effective policies to help lift the poorest
8701232 the bank said its latest estimates show the number of poor had fallen from 52 percent of the developing worlds population in 1981 to 26 percent in 2005
8701233 the report the world banks most ambitious attempt ever to update its poverty estimates suggests that while huge economic progress has been made around the world many nations including emerging juggernauts such as china are not as rich as many had thought
8701234 i will express my hate joy anger love consternation by furrowing my brows and looking disturbed

8701236 anstatt einer leichten rechtskurve machen wir nun einen scharfen turn nach rechts durch diese nderung des winkels m ssen die autos jetzt mehr verz gern und sogar ziemlich hart bremsen so gibt es dort nun eine zus tzliche berholm glichkeit
8701237 stra enkurs auf dem du nicht viel raum f r fehler hast wenn du auch nur ein bisschen zu schnell in einer kurve bist dann ist dein spielraum sehr gering durch die mauern hast du den eindruck dass du in einer sehr engen umgebung bist das ist schon etwa besonderes
8701238 we are beginning our descent into denver airport the temperature at 9 00 a m is 50 degrees with rain and winds out of the west the rain is expected to continue throughout the day
8701239 i dont what youre talking about im getting a hotel room with a hot tub tonight

8701242 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations
8701243 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8701244 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights

8701251 i never took hurricane dean seriously the last time and it blew my house down
8701252 i strive for the huddle to be very relaxed and everyone focused on me
8701253 it has been that way if things go wrong if you have a dropped ball or a fumble and we recover you want guys to come back to the huddle and say hey you know what guys my fault ill get the next one
8701254 when you get that it reassures confidence in everyone else im not here yelling at everyone my job is to provide confidence i tell guys im coming right back to them and i need them
8701255 if you can get the feeling of youre up 21 youre going to play a lot better when you start thinking about stuff and worrying about stuff that messes your game up and slows you down a little bit it comes from experience but you have to be able to be in that situation where this is no problem were just going to roll down the field and get where we have to get
8701256 hes the president of the group he gets us in the positions we need to be in hes real loose and i like that about donovan hes not so uptight in the huddle that affects everybody when the person leading is relaxed and confident then everyone else is going to feel that and try to display that same attribute that he has
8701257 on issues relating to the vice presidency thats obviously sen mccains decision
8701258 the mccain campaign will be making those announcements friday presumably
8701259 we just keep it moving as much as we can
8701260 you can still pay attention while youre doing something else other than just sitting there and dreaming about motorcycles or something
8701261 every now and then you kind of get heavy eyed a little bit
8701262 and its getting closer to the game maybe thats why thursday is so long
8701263 then someones going to key on it so i have to change things up show people different things and mess around with stuff i think that is the difference between a guy with experience and a guy without experience
8701264 i pretty much know where im going to be so i can mess with a guy
8701265 i can take a chance on a guy and get in his face if a guys winded i know i can get up and grab a hold of him because hes not going to be able to run around me youve got to be able to key off all that stuff even to the point where youre reading safeties and know if a guy is going to slam across your face youre taking chances but theyre all calculated
8701266 im always getting coached and then its about accepting the coaching and trying to put it into my game to make it better
8701267 thats a game where we did quite a bit of different stuff because we felt we had to
8701268 and we still made some mistakes in that game you have to watch how much you put in because youre vulnerable to mistakes but for the most part we felt we did a pretty good job
8701269 we felt good because youre going up against a good team
8701270 theres something to saying hey break their undefeated season its a challenge and we can do this
8701271 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
8701272 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
8701273 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting

8701276 ich f hlte mich im auto wohl drehte viele runden und fand einige teile die uns beim rennen hier nach vorne bringen m ssten wir hatten einiges zu arbeiten um ein gutes setup zu finden das ber die kerbs und in den langsamen kurven funktioniert ohne gleichzeitig beim bremsen und auf den geraden zeit zu verlieren und wir versuchten ein gutes setup f r den massentr gheitsd mpfer zu finden
8701277 wir machten einige gute schritte vorw rts die uns auch beim n chstw chigen belgien grand prix helfen k nnten daher bin ich gl cklich und ich f hle mich auf die n chsten rennen gut vorbereitet
8701278 das heutige programm kn pfte nahtlos an das gestrige an adrian evaluierte setups und fl geleinstellungen f r den italien grand prix au erdem probierten wir eine entwicklungskomponente f r die hinterradaufh ngung aus bremsen und setups f r die kerbs die in der roggia schikane besonders anspruchsvoll sind es war eine gute vorbereitung auf das rennen hier
8701279 wir geben uns viel m he um f r diese strecke das richtige setup zu finden
8701280 au erdem legen wir unser augenmerk auch auf die zuverl ssigkeit und auf das fahrverhalten ber die kerbs in monza den damit hatten wir im vorjahr schwierigkeiten ich denke wir arbeiten gut auch wenn wir das nat rlich erst nach dem grand prix von italien best tigt wissen k nnen
8701281 wir sind nicht mit wenig benzin gefahren und haben alles erreicht was wir uns vorgenommen hatten wir mussten einen motor wechseln aber das war aus gr nden der homologierung von vornherein geplant
8701282 ich hoffe wir k nnen in monza die form fortf hren die uns auf platz vier in der konstrukteurs wm gebracht hat wir haben uns heute vor allem auf die f r diese strecke wichtigen dinge konzentriert also auf das aerodynamische setup das gef hl f r die bremsen und das berfahren der kerbs ich bin recht zufrieden mit unseren fortschritten
8701283 its like sitting on your back porch and driving your house
8701284 their projected rates of expansion are so fast that we dont have a hope in hell of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
8701285 we are blessed by the fact that our friend and neighbor is also our number one supplier of foreign oil
8701286 the amount of energy that you have to use to get that oil out of the ground is such that it actually creates a much greater impact on climate change as well as using much more energy than even traditional petroleum
8701287 if american mayors want to send their money to unstable undemocratic countries in the middle east instead of to canada that will be their call if they want to pay a premium for iranian saudi iraqi oil that will be their call
8701288 do you think americans are going to be paying a buck or a buck fifty more because somebody said that our carbon footprint is higher than oil from kazakhstan
8701289 you have to consider the environmental impact in a broader context
8701290 there is significant economic benefit from the development of oil sands the oil sands represent a very secure reliable long term source of supply to the united states people in the u s will have to judge whether that supply stacks up to other alternatives
8701291 they say no no were going to do research and really clean up our act well you cant give these guys permission to go ahead on the promise that something is going to happen in the future
8701292 for 40 years a couple of oil companies worked on the tar sands extraction process not its environmental impacts it was albertas massive expansion of tar sands leasing over the last few years ignoring serious unanswered environmental and public health concerns that created this mushrooming crisis
8701293 it would be the equivalent of several hundred exxon valdez oil spills
8701294 im just one of a chorus of people that are concerned
8701295 while we dont disagree that the resources should be exploited for human consumption we are saying it should be done in a way thats manageable responsible sustainable there are gross negligent environment and health issues being observed

8701316 there are files from all kinds of sources that we want to store and manage files are created by our digital cameras e mail cell phones portable media players camcorders pdas and laptops increasingly computer users are using different folders drives and even different computers such as a laptop and a desktop to store manage retrieve and view files yet managing hundreds or thousands of files is still largely a manual operation in some cases it is necessary to regularly get copies of files from another location to add to primary location in other cases there is a need to keep two storage locations exactly in sync some users manage files manually dragging and dropping from one place to another and keeping track of whether the locations are synchronized in their heads other users may use two or more applications to provide this functionality now there is an easier way synctoy a free powertoy for microsoft windows is an easy to use highly customizable program that helps users to do the heavy lifting involved with the copying moving and synchronization of different directories most common operations can be performed with just a few clicks of the mouse and additional customization is available without additional complexity synctoy can manage multiple sets of folders at the same time it can combine files from two folders in one case and mimic renames and deletes in another case unlike other applications synctoy actually keeps track of renames to files and will make sure those changes get carried over to the synchronized folder

8701391 alla faccia della tanto decantata difesa dellitalianit ci consegna una compagnia di bandiera che di fatto diventa di bandierina con un inaccettabile ridimensionamento della capacit di espansione internazionale
8701392 my position is rather a curious one inside i am really bursting with boyish merriment but i acted the paralytic professor so well that now i cant leave off so that when i am among friends and have no need at all to disguise myself i still cant help speaking slow and wrinkling my forehead just as if it were my forehead i can be quite happy you understand but only in a paralytic sort of way the most buoyant exclamations leap up in my heart but they come out of my mouth quite different you should hear me say buck up old cock it would bring tears to your eyes
8701393 but i cannot help thinking that apart from all that you are really a bit worried
8701394 it is a pleasure to work with you yes i have rather a heavy cloud in my head there is a great problem to face
8701395 it would have done just as well if you could work a typewriter
8701396 and remember whom we have to see tomorrow you and i are going to morrow to attempt something which is very much more dangerous than trying to steal the crown jewels out of the tower we are trying to steal a secret from a very sharp very strong and very wicked man i believe there is no man except the president of course who is so seriously startling and formidable as that little grinning fellow in goggles he has not perhaps the white hot enthusiasm unto death the mad martyrdom for anarchy which marks the secretary but then that very fanaticism in the secretary has a human pathos and is almost a redeeming trait but the little doctor has a brutal sanity that is more shocking than the secretarys disease dont you notice his detestable virility and vitality he bounces like an india rubber ball depend on it sunday was not asleep i wonder if he ever sleeps when he locked up all the plans of this outrage in the round black head of dr bull
8701397 that this unique monster will be soothed if i play the piano to him
8701398 i mentioned the piano because it gives one quick and independent fingers syme if we are to go through this interview and come out sane or alive we must have some code of signals between us that this brute will not see i have made a rough alphabetical cypher corresponding to the five fingers like this see
8701399 b a d bad a word we may frequently require
8701400 words that we are likely to want fine shades of meaning my favourite word is coeval whats yours
8701401 we must have lush word applied to grass dont you know
8701402 that we are going to talk to dr bull about grass
8701403 there are several ways in which the subject could be approached
8701404 i dreamt of that alphabet of yours did it take you long to make it up
8701405 i say did it take you long to invent all this im considered good at these things and it was a good hours grind did you learn it all on the spot
8701406 i will only talk like this we must get used to it
8701407 you have no doubt made all the arrangements for the paris affair
8701408 we have information which renders intolerable anything in the nature of a moments delay
8701409 please do not think me excessively abrupt but i advise you to alter those plans or if it is too late for that to follow your agent with all the support you can get for him comrade syme and i have had an experience which it would take more time to recount than we can afford if we are to act on it i will however relate the occurrence in detail even at the risk of losing time if you really feel that it is essential to the understanding of the problem we have to discuss
8701410 the incident that has occurred to us and has led us to ask for information about the marquis is one which you may think it better to have narrated but as it came in the way of comrade syme rather than me
8701411 you must go on this devil has sucked me dry
8701412 i had the good fortune to fall into conversation with a detective who took me thanks to my hat for a respectable person
8701413 syme immediately brought this information to me and we came here together to see what use you would be inclined to make of it
8701414 you scarcely realise how poetic my intuition is it has that sudden quality we sometimes feel in the coming of spring
8701415 that it resembles that sudden smell of the sea which may be found in the heart of lush woods
8701416 it is positive as is the passionate red hair of a beautiful woman
8701417 would you do me a small favour would you be so kind as to take off your spectacles
8701418 i knew my intuition was as infallible as the pope it was the spectacles that did it it was all the spectacles given those beastly black eyes and all the rest of him his health and his jolly looks made him a live devil among dead ones
8701419 look at him look at his face look at his collar look at his blessed boots you dont suppose do you that that things an anarchist
8701420 ill take the risk of that myself dr bull i am a police officer theres my card
8701421 for we can all start for france together yes im in the force right enough
8701422 if this is all right there were more damned detectives than there were damned dynamiters at the damned council
8701423 we were not four against three we were not so lucky we were four against one
8701424 ive been half dead with the jumps being quite alone i nearly flung my arms round gogol and embraced him which would have been imprudent i hope you wont despise me for having been in a blue funk
8701425 contributed to my blue funk but the worst devil was you and your infernal goggles
8701426 such a simple idea not my own i havent got the brains you see i wanted to go into the detective service especially the anti dynamite business but for that purpose they wanted someone to dress up as a dynamiter and they all swore by blazes that i could never look like a dynamiter they said my very walk was respectable and that seen from behind i looked like the british constitution they said i looked too healthy and too optimistic and too reliable and benevolent they called me all sorts of names at scotland yard they said that if i had been a criminal i might have made my fortune by looking so like an honest man but as i had the misfortune to be an honest man there was not even the remotest chance of my assisting them by ever looking like a criminal but as last i was brought before some old josser who was high up in the force and who seemed to have no end of a head on his shoulders and there the others all talked hopelessly one asked whether a bushy beard would hide my nice smile another said that if they blacked my face i might look like a negro anarchist but this old chap chipped in with a most extraordinary remark a pair of smoked spectacles will do it he said positively look at him now he looks like an angelic office boy put him on a pair of smoked spectacles and children will scream at the sight of him and so it was by george when once my eyes were covered all the rest smile and big shoulders and short hair made me look a perfect little devil as i say it was simple enough when it was done like miracles but that wasnt the really miraculous part of it there was one really staggering thing about the business and my head still turns at it
8701427 this big pot in the police who sized me up so that he knew how the goggles would go with my hair and socks by god he never saw me at all
8701428 but we talked in a pitch dark room like a coalcellar there you would never have guessed that
8701429 to go to france for my lunch but i am delighted to have someone to lunch with me you see i had to send that beast the marquis over with his bomb because the president had his eye on me though god knows how ill tell you the story some day it was perfectly choking whenever i tried to slip out of it i saw the president somewhere smiling out of the bow window of a club or taking off his hat to me from the top of an omnibus i tell you you can say what you like that fellow sold himself to the devil he can be in six places at once
8701430 was it long ago shall we be in time to catch him
8701431 ive timed it all hell still be at calais when we arrive
8701432 theoretically i ought to drown myself first i promised a poor fellow who was a real modern pessimist on my word of honour not to tell the police im no hand at casuistry but i cant break my word to a modern pessimist its like breaking ones word to a child
8701433 i tried to tell the police and i couldnt because of some silly oath i took you see when i was an actor i was a sort of all round beast perjury or treason is the only crime i havent committed if i did that i shouldnt know the difference between right and wrong
8701434 and ive made up my mind i gave my promise to the secretary you know him man who smiles upside down my friends that man is the most utterly unhappy man that was ever human it may be his digestion or his conscience or his nerves or his philosophy of the universe but hes damned hes in hell well i cant turn on a man like that and hunt him down its like whipping a leper i may be mad but thats how i feel and theres jolly well the end of it
8701435 i knew you would decide like that when first you
8701436 it seems that we have all the same kind of morality or immorality so we had better face the fact that comes of it
8701437 youre quite right and we must hurry up for i can see the grey nose standing out from france
8701438 is this that we three are alone on this planet
8701439 my idea is this we must do something to keep the marquis in calais till tomorrow midday i have turned over twenty schemes in my head we cannot denounce him as a dynamiter that is agreed we cannot get him detained on some trivial charge for we should have to appear he knows us and he would smell a rat we cannot pretend to keep him on anarchist business he might swallow much in that way but not the notion of stopping in calais while the czar went safely through paris we might try to kidnap him and lock him up ourselves but he is a well known man here he has a whole bodyguard of friends he is very strong and brave and the event is doubtful the only thing i can see to do is actually to take advantage of the very things that are in the marquiss favour i am going to profit by the fact that he is a highly respected nobleman i am going to profit by the fact that he has many friends and moves in the best society
8701440 but there is a tradition that one of them rode behind bruce at bannockburn since 1350 the tree is quite clear
8701441 are argent a chevron gules charged with three cross crosslets of the field the motto varies
8701442 the house of st eustache also is very ancient the marquis cannot deny that he is a gentleman he cannot deny that i am a gentleman and in order to put the matter of my social position quite beyond a doubt i propose at the earliest opportunity to knock his hat off but here we are in the harbour
8701443 vote in 2008 sticker and a kid that i assumed was his son with a clipboard heres how the conversation went
8701444 hi i was just about to knock on your door
8701445 were canvasing the neighborhood talking to registered voters are you a registered voter
8701446 well were going around talking to everyone about proposition 8 voting yes on prop 8
8701447 were trying to get people to vote yes on prop 8 its about protecting the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman
8701448 oh do you already have a stand on prop 8
8701449 why yes i do this whole household is voting no on proposition 8 we all stand that marriage is between two people who love each other not a matter of gender
8701450 and you see that car in the driveway the one with unitarian church equality and rainbow stickers yeah all of our cars pretty much look like that
8701451 whos a good puppy barking at the close minded people whos a good girl
8701452 were trying to get people to vote yes on prop 8 its about protecting the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman
8701453 well let you know when we need you if we need you
8701454 strident partnership breeds mistrust of government turning politician and politics into dirty words
8701455 in a mixed environment where users are running 2 0 2 0 1 and 2 0 2 the power control problems of 2 0 and 2 0 1 will affect the 2 0 2 users
8701456 this is the most important election ever in my lifetime for the legal profession
8701457 unless we get a democratic administration elected in november the doors of the courthouses of this country will continue to close victims will be further deprived of whatever limited rights they have now and it will be a very difficult place for trial lawyers particularly on both the plaintiffs and defense side of the docket to practice their profession

8701597 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8701598 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way

8701716 a real sense and apprehension of the divine excellency of things revealed in the word of god
8701717 he that is spiritually enlightened truly apprehends and sees it or has a sense of it he does not merely rationally believe that god is glorious but he has a sense of the gloriousness of god in his heart
8701718 believe the doctrines of gods word to be divine because they see a divine and transcendent and most evidently distinguishing glory in them
8701719 and why may there not be that stamp of divinity or divine glory on the word of god that may be distinguishing and as rationally convincing as e g christs transfiguration provided it be but seen
8701720 it is rational to suppose that this knowledge should be given immediately by god
8701721 perceiving of spiritual beauty and excellency no more belongs to reason than it belongs to the sense of feeling to perceive colours or to the power of seeing to perceive the sweetness of food

8701723 the pathology of a martyr complex is often a heavy handed attempt to escape the vulnerability of speaking the turth without the means of convincing others that it is true it signifies impatience with the freedom of others not to believe it betrays an insecurity that cannot bear its own knowledge without compulsion for everyone else in a word it expresses doubt such doubt may explain why martyrdom is sometimes misconstrued and applied to the deaths of fighters for the new testament martyrs do not die because they fight for what is right but precisely because they refuse to fight for what is true a fighter fundamentally dubts whether his truth is true and anxiously grasps at it preferring secure knowledge to uncertain promise made certain only through faith fighters do not stand by the truth of their convictions
8701724 but do you think that most the delegates on the floor really understand that president kerry is not going to pursue a policy in iraq that is essentially different from the one that george bush is pursuing
8701725 i think that they recognize that we cannot afford to simply cut and run in iraq and that we are in a difficult situation right now and i think that what they are hoping for is somebody who is going to bring a thoughtfulness and a base of experience to decision making in the white house which john kerry possesses and i think that george bush does not
8701726 well ted you have been there and i have not
8701727 i do not know whether or not we can accomplish that in six months if we can then i think john kerry will bring our troops home
8701728 my assumption would be that if we could actually stabilize iraq in such a way that you do not have warfare between the sunnis the shiias and the kurds some semblance of law and order in that country then i think that there is no doubt that the kerry administration is going to be interested in bringing back the reservists and the national guardsmen who are currently there but

8701868 take the most recent available greenhouse gas inventory estimates of uk carbon dioxide emissions from all domestic flights and departing international flights indicatively account for the non co2 climate change effects of air travel applying a multiplier value of 1 91 to reflect the degree of uncertainty around this value a sensitivity range of 1 to 4 will also be presented then multiply this by the appropriate monetary value based on the governments shadow price of carbon again using a sensitivity range to reflect the uncertainty and compare this range of values with the air passenger duty aviation duty and aviation gasoline duty receipts for the year concerned
8701869 this study focuses on aggregate taxes and the aggregate cost of emissions whether across the country or in a local authority area and different activities are taxed to different extents there might be a case that there is room to do more to correct for the externalities associated with emissions from agriculture for example which is currently actively subsidised if someone is to take that line though they have to also accept that green taxes such as fuel duty are currently set too high and should be reduced
8701870 despite recent advances in modelling there is considerable uncertainty about the scc associated with any particular stabilisation goal and there is no guarantee that this value will be sufficient to incentivise the necessary abatement to attain that goal

8701878 so far i havent been able to tell whether or not my beautiful cat nani is afraid of the saudi religious police apparatuses
8701879 nani has come to be seen as an abomination against which religious police officials must wage an unrelenting war
8701880 i will try to explain all this to nani even if it means printing out some pictures of religious police officials from the internet and posting them in the living room and the kitchen where she likes to lounge
8701881 i am well aware of nanis predicament and am seriously contemplating how to smuggle her out of my aunts house and into my own without hurting her feelings
8701882 if i try to smuggle her under the car seat she will be angry with me and her mood will be ruined and for the rest of the day she will refuse food and will try to punish me by shunning my company
8701883 i would certainly expect the brave religious police to adopt a more honorable policy
8701884 i hereby call on religious police officials to retract their statements since nani and her friends are virtuous and will never overstep moral boundaries accordingly i ask this respected government apparatus to retract its media announcements and demand that those who issued the fatwa prohibiting the sale of cats and dogs abrogate it
8701885 conservatives argue quite rightly that on the whole kids are better off in intact families when they are raised by two parents all the evidence says that conservatives are right about that liberals resisted this for a while i think they resist it less now but then the question becomes okay youre for the family what do you do about it if we have a whole bunch of young men whove grown up in broken families in violent neighborhoods and end up in prison how is that going to help strengthen the family there is a moral basis for a healthy family but theres also an economic basis for the healthy family the job of progressives is not to argue with conservatives about whether family is important or not they should agree with them on that they should argue with them about whether conservative policies strengthen or undermine the family

8701953 why seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process it is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side and the job is done
8701954 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president

8701998 du wei t genau dass ich ihn immer noch lieb hab was soll ich denn machen so tun als ob er mir egal w re
8701999 du hast einmal zu mir gesagt wenn ich glaube du machst einen bl dsinn soll ich dir das zu verstehen geben du w rdest mir auch nicht b se sein weil du schon einmal einen riesen bl dsinn gemacht hast wo dich eine freundin sehenden auges in dein ungl ck hat hineinrennen lassen
8702000 das ist jetzt nicht der richtige augenblick mich daran zu erinnern
8702001 aber das hat er doch so lange nicht mehr mit uns gemacht warum heute
8702002 wie oft soll ich dir noch sagen dass du klar und deutlich etwas fordern oder ablehnen kannst
8702003 du hast auch nicht gewusst dass er heute morgen noch da sein wird
8702004 was f r ein kluger kopf du bist nein ich hab auch nicht damit gerechnet dass er jetzt noch hier sein wird
8702005 sei nicht so stur simon wir gehen jetzt in die k che und ich mach fr hst ck f r uns drei
8702006 hast du schon gesehen dass es geschneit hat heute nacht
8702007 das hei t dass ich heute nicht ins b ro fahren kann
8702008 wir m ssen auch noch z hneputzen es hei t es ist nicht gesund zu fr hst cken ohne vorher die z hne geputzt zu haben
8702009 weil sich ber nacht ein bakterienbelag auf z hnen und zahnfleisch bildet der nicht mit dem essen in magen und darm gelangen soll
8702010 k nntest du das bitte lassen ich versuche in simons gegenwart nicht zu rauchen
8702011 keine schlechte idee es soll ja nicht gesund sein auf n chternen magen zu rauchen
8702012 dann werd ich jetzt wohl auch erst einmal meine z hne putzen gehen so wie du mir das vorgemacht hast simon
8702013 putzt du dir denn nicht die z hne vor dem fr hst ck
8702014 nein nicht immer aber ich hab mir schon gedacht dass das gescheit ist
8702015 du hast mich doch gestern gefragt wie du dir die neunerreihe leichter merken kannst hast du rechnen heute
8702016 und religion haben wir auch aber das gef llt mir nicht so
8702017 weil es so langweilig und so anstrengend ist dauernd erz hlt uns der alte pfarrer von seinem strengen gott der uns bestrafen wird weil wir alle s nder sind einmal hab ich zu ihm gesagt er soll mit uns nicht ber s nden reden weil wir noch unschuldig sind
8702018 das hat mir die klara gesagt aber der pfar rer hat mich streng angesehen und gemeint ich soll in mich gehen und heraus finden welche fehler ich hab ich habe sicher eine ganze menge s nden
8702019 das war sehr mutig von dir h tte ich dir gar nicht zugetraut
8702020 ich hab das nicht so gemeint du wirkst so brav auf mich und daher wundere ich mich wenn du so keck sein kannst
8702021 er steht immer alleine da mit seinen klugen fragen und ansichten weil sich nie mand ihm anschlie en will ich hoffe das f hrt bei ihm nicht auch dazu dass er schlie lich nicht mehr fragen will
8702022 warum geht er berhaupt in den religionsunterricht du kannst ihn doch raus nehmen
8702023 ich hab dem simon schon gesagt dass er nicht gehen muss wenn er nicht will fr her haben sie eine ganz nette religionslehrerin gehabt die ist dann leider weggegangen weil sie ein kind bekommen hat
8702024 sagen sie ihm er soll nicht immer so frech sein das geh rt sich nicht
8702025 wissen sie was er unl ngst gesagt hat als ich erkl rte dass es das himmelreich nur f r uns menschen gibt
8702026 wenn die tiere da nicht hin d rfen dann will er da auch nicht hin das kann kein sch ner ort sein wenn es dort keine tiere gibt
8702027 es w re mir lieber sie n hmen ihn aus dem religionsunterricht

8702060 applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a seasonally adjusted 425 000 down 10 000 from the previous week the labor department reported that was a slightly better figure than the 427 000 analysts expected the four week moving average also improved to 440 250 down from 446 250 the previous week
8702061 the biggest factor in the gdps second quarter rebound was robust sales of u s exports the weaker value of the u s dollar has bolstered those sales which accounted for half of the gain in gdp
8702062 the number of people continuing to receive unemployment also rose to 3 4 million up 64 000 from the previous week and the highest level in almost five years
8702063 the lines are too short at hospital emergency rooms my children dont hear enough foreign languages in the classroom or during recess our school taxes arent high enough to pay for building new classrooms for our guests our jails are not completely full
8702064 we can close this deficiency by passing co hb 1325 the alien importation act of 2008
8702065 do you recall the defend colorado now immigration petition in 2006
8702066 all those mean colorado citizens wanted to take welfare state benefits away from our foreign cousins visiting us here from our extended world family
8702067 now a second branch of state government our responsive legislature is also heeding the public will
8702068 you say americans dont want this seasonal work at any wage
8702069 no wonder since the cato institute estimated about eight years ago that the cash value of colorados total welfare benefits was the equivalent of 10
8702070 why work when government will pay you not to work
8702071 here we can show our international compassion and at the same time prop up the welfare state entitlements that created the wage rate distortion such a deal
8702072 obviously we cant use prison labor to pick crops as other states do
8702073 the convicts might object or get calluses on their hands
8702074 once we implement this brilliant program for agriculture can manufacturing construction and other labor sectors be far behind
8702075 look how successful this program has been in germany and other parts of europe which now are overflowing with turkish greek and other immigrants angrily creating their own subcultures
8702076 we have plenty of examples of the results of our immigration tolerance both legal and illegal
8702077 nice foreign national who came to colorado illegally to serve you
8702078 hb 1325 is an ingenious solution to the illegal alien problem
8702079 it makes them legal because government gives them a piece of paper
8702080 of course over the next five years these 15 000 aliens will all go home when requested
8702081 just because we already have more than 10 20 million examples to the contrary doesnt mean our failed immigration policy wont work this time
8702082 democrats should support this bill even though it is a precedent to further undermine organized labor after all when the next amnesty comes these people are expected to register and vote democrat
8702083 republicans should support this bill to maintain their image of exploiting the little guy on behalf of big business
8702084 from the halls of congress we learn that the social service costs for just the illegal aliens is upwards of 436 billion annually
8702085 these figures are relevant to this bill because we will be importing our guests from the segment of third world foreign societies that provides the same people who now invade illegally
8702086 the america i knew growing up did not have these problems

8702275 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power its a philosophy the american people never actually had a chance to see in action fully until 2001 when the republicans finally gained control of both the white house and the congress then we saw what would happen to america if the policies they had talked about for decades actually were implemented and look what happened they took us from record surpluses to an exploding debt from over 22 million new jobs to just 5 million from increasing family incomes to nearly 7 500 dollars a year to a decline of more than 2 000 dollars a year from almost 8 million americans lifted out of poverty to more than 5 and a half million driven into poverty and millions more losing their health insurance now in spite of all this evidence their candidate is actually promising more of the same think about it more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans that will swell the deficit increase inequality and weaken the economy more bandaids for health care that will enrich insurance companies impoverish familes and increase the number of uninsured more going it alone in the world instead of building a shared responsibility and shared opportunities necessary to advance our security and restore our influence they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more now lets send them a message that will echo from the rockies all across america a simple message thanks but no thanks

8702442 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying even as late as yesterday we had secured a new investment package but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying the collapse of zoom is a result of matter beyond our control
8702443 there are a number of ground support agencies and services as well as the airport authority that are owed some funds from zoom so the aircraft is on the ground in calgary pending resolution with zoom and the leaseholder as well as the creditors

8702460 last time team officials called me up and said were going out to oakland for a week pack up a weeks worth of clothes
8702461 so i pack up some clothes and get out to oakland and look on tv and every thing i own is under water
8702462 weve all had time to put together a clear plan as to how it affects the organization the team the families of the team
8702463 i dont want to go into detail as to what we do because what we do is really predicated on when its supposed to arrive
8702464 we will be focused and ready to play the buccaneers
8702465 were planning on that game being at the superdome but the powers that be will have a clear plan in place if that should change any or if our preparation should have to be somewhere else it wont be a distraction we wont allow it to be
8702466 that first game that right there ill never forget that
8702467 even though we didnt make it to the super bowl that year that was my super bowl i never seen anything like that and i was just happy to see people out in the streets just happy to see the saints play that day thats probably one thing ill always remember about new orleans is that day
8702468 there are some areas where it looks like it happened yesterday
8702469 those are houses people used to live in and theyre not living there any more so where are they
8702470 i felt like we were all kind of in this thing together
8702471 im trying to rebuild my career coming off the injury and changing teams kind of a fresh start for me a fresh start for the organization and a fresh start for the city
8702472 the more you talk to people and the more you drive around i think you just feel like life is back
8702473 when the storm happened your mindset had to be were going to make things better than they were before were going to try to turn this into a positive somehow some way i see that happening in a lot of areas so just to kind of be there and just feel like youre kind of a part of the rebuilding process is rewarding

8702487 we continue to believe that association could reflect real contamination early on
8702488 it is information that is more restricted in time and does not have confirmatory laboratory findings behind it
8702489 after i used it for three days all of my acne dried up and went away
8702490 it is very effective some people dont believe in it but people who do really get a good result
8702491 after that my friends who work at garment factories in phnom penh advised me to apply the lubricant from number one plus condoms on my face every night
8702492 and just within three to four nights the acne on my face gradually and then totally disappeared
8702493 the toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
8702494 is so unreal that when the commissioners visited they all asked me monique where are we thats canada im a citizen and i had difficulty explaining
8702495 economic growth is raising incomes in many countries but increasing national wealth alone does not necessarily increase national health without equitable distribution of benefits national growth can even exacerbate inequities
8702496 the health care system is itself a social determinant of health influenced by and influencing the effect of other social determinants
8702497 are already developing policies across governments to tackle inequities these examples show that change is possible through political will

8702530 these kinds of data help us to quantify the differences between countries and to highlight where additional efforts are needed some of these countries have rarely had any population survey data to help their program planning efforts
8702531 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change
8702532 they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change and they need positive reinforcement for changing many of these principles can be applied in designing education programs to encourage and support behaviour change

8702536 harper began the tour in tuktoyaktuk with an announcement on arctic sovereignty essentially arguing canada should extend its jurisdictional reach into the arctic ocean doubling it from 100 nautical miles to 200 nautical miles
8702537 whether it is the thawing of the northwest passage or the suspected resource riches under the arctic seabed more and more countries are taking an interest in the waterways of the canadian arctic
8702538 we will be sending a clear message to the world that our environmental standards and sovereignty are not up for debate if you are in canadas arctic you will be playing by canadas rules
8702539 some countries may object to what were doing on principle on the grounds that they may not recognize our sovereignty i expect that we will get co operation for the most part on reporting because i think it ultimately is in everybodys interest to ensure that there is some kind of authority in the area some kind of environmental and commercial authority
8702540 i think everybody understands that canada has no particular power play here this is in the interests of order and also in the interests of environmental protection
8702541 oh and congratulations for announcing more spending when youve already plunged us into a deficit thanks to your complete incompetence

8702545 all obstructions to the execution of the laws all combinations and associations under whatever plausible character with the real design to direct control counteract or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities are destructive of this fundamental principle and of fatal tendency
8702546 however combinations or associations of the above description may now and then answer popular ends they are likely in the course of time and things to become potent engines by which cunning ambitious and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion

8702566 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights
8702567 youtube has gone above and beyond the law to protect content owners while empowering people to communicate and share their experiences online
8702568 the record presented demonstrates that far from encouraging copyright infringement veoh has a strong dmca policy takes active steps to limit incidents of infringement on its website and works diligently to keep unauthorized works off its website
8702569 in sum veoh has met its burden in establishing its entitlement to safe harbor for the alleged infringements here
8702570 we cannot say whether maryland courts would go as far as courts in some states in categorizing the activities that must be offered without charge but whatever the outer limits of marylands free public schools guarantee we are safe in saying that anything directly related to a schools curriculum must be available to all without charge
8702571 we absolutly are in conformance with state law we are adamant that we are providing a free public education
8702572 there are a lot more questions about the variety of the fees and that is a fair question
8702573 our data seems to point toward the inherent decision that is made when the tumor is formed whether it is highly malignant or not moreover since the characteristic might be dependent on the normal cell status one might imagine that they might be different between individuals
8702574 this does suggest that cells can sit for a long time then be activated
8702575 but these cells were injected into the circulation normal breast cells are not supposed to be in the circulation
8702576 cells that did not have any oncogenes in them and do not transform spontaneously as per all published studies we could see little colonies of these cells when we inspected the lungs
8702577 at no point never did we see a solid vision that would resemble metastatic colonies but it appears that every time we looked at the animal the colonies appeared to be larger

8702588 this is great news for stroke survivors because results clearly demonstrate that long term stroke damage is not immutable and that with exercise its never too late for the brain and body to recover
8702589 this suggests that the brain is responsible for the improvement we saw in patients walking ability it seems to be recruiting other regions to take on the job of areas damaged by stroke
8702590 many stroke survivors believe theres nothing to be gained from further rehabilitation but our results suggest that health and functional benefits from walking on a treadmill can occur even decades out from stroke
8702591 we believe exercise gives individuals a way to fight back against stroke disabilities
8702592 scientists have identified a mutant form of a gene or allele that prohibits the growth of armour
8702593 by documenting the physical traits and genetic makeup of the offspring produced by these marine sticklebacks in freshwater we were able to track how natural selection operates on this gene
8702594 we found a significant increase in the frequency of this allele in their offspring evidence that natural selection favours reduced armour in freshwater
8702595 it leads us to believe that the genetic expression is also tied to increased growth rate
8702596 if the fish arent expending resources growing bones which may be significantly more difficult in freshwater due to its lack of ions they can devote more energy to increasing biomass
8702597 this in turn allows them to breed earlier and improves over winter survival rate
8702598 this study provides further evidence for darwins theory of natural selection by showing that environmental conditions can directly impact genes controlling physical traits that affect the survival of species
8702599 all i would say is that were looking at various options in terms of our response to russias aggression in georgia the priority for the administration right now is to try to bring into fruition the us the 123 agreement with india and that civil nuclear cooperation agreement thats where our focus is right now

8702611 he even stopped talking and was immediately rushed to amri where he was admitted at the iccu his situation had become worse he is still critical and undergoing treatment however he has been shifted from iccu but is under observation
8702612 i am really looking forward to the upcoming series i am interested to see how far india has come since we last played we have certainly moved on and they are an equally strong side
8702613 we have just got to be going out there and win every game of cricket in preparation for the world cup and obviously we want to keep putting in good performances
8702614 i was watching their hands especially mendis my plan was that if i can read his hand i can play well that was the game plan
8702615 i think i was able to read both murali and mendis well scoring 76 and helping my team win is satisfying
8702616 whenever we are at the nets or batting together he tells me how to plan he is such a class reader of the game he always plays with responsibility we learn a lot from him while batting with him it is good we got partnerships in two matches
8702617 at age three to four the overwhelming majority of children behave selfishly whereas most children at age seven eight prefer resource allocations that remove advantageous or disadvantageous inequality

8702619 the rice procurement as on august 26 was 269 09 lakh tons against the overall procurement of 251 07 lakh tons in 2006 2007 in august 2008 6 06 lakh tons of rice has been procured compared with 1 09 lakh tons procured in august 2007
8702620 it is estimated that the stock of wheat as on 1 4 2009 will be higher at 78 60 lakh tons compared to the buffer norms of 40 lakh tons similarly rice stock will be 62 43 lakh tons as on 1 10 2008 against the buffer norm of 52 lakh tons
8702621 we requested the lt governor to invite vaithilingam to form the next government in the union territory
8702622 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8702623 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8702624 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8702625 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8702626 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer
8702627 i am surprised that you have been in the aiadmk for so long
8702628 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas
8702629 they showed significant stress on the endoplasmic reticulum and the tissue itself was more inflamed than in our lean patients
8702630 if they go over this danger level we have to ask them to play more quietly
8702631 scientists have identified a mutant form of a gene or allele that prohibits the growth of armour
8702632 by documenting the physical traits and genetic makeup of the offspring produced by these marine sticklebacks in freshwater we were able to track how natural selection operates on this gene
8702633 we found a significant increase in the frequency of this allele in their offspring evidence that natural selection favours reduced armour in freshwater
8702634 it leads us to believe that the genetic expression is also tied to increased growth rate

8702638 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
8702639 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
8702640 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
8702641 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
8702642 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable
8702643 this follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value i think what were seeing is evolutionary
8702644 what were dealing with here is a use of the technology that i dont think the good people at magellan or garmin or tomtom really thought about when they were developing it
8702645 typically the gps data being used is for the purpose of contradicting defendants alibis
8702646 i think that in the last couple of years people are starting to be aware that if they have these units in their car people can keep track of you
8702647 i think its a growing public awareness the problem is that most people feel like im not doing anything wrong so who cares but i think thats the wrong way of looking at it

8702650 many stroke survivors believe theres nothing to be gained from further rehabilitation but our results suggest that health and functional benefits from walking on a treadmill can occur even decades out from stroke
8702651 we believe exercise gives individuals a way to fight back against stroke disabilities
8702652 kenyans like the rest of the world are indeed proud of the barack obama candidature not because of his origin but because of the kind of change that he portrays and intends to bring to the world scene on foreign policy
8702653 i am curious though to know what the real motivation of the american press is in really emphasizing on the american and african roots of barack obama as opposed to seeking to advance the real change that he would be standing for
8702654 the fact that he has that foreign heritage i think in the end will not make that much difference to most american voters
8702655 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8702656 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8702657 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8702658 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8702659 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer
8702660 such a high percentage of polarisation means you really have to have very good conditions a magnetic field that is very ordered
8702661 but once you get away from the pulsar then you get a much more complex situation because the field begins to break up into little patches and knots
8702662 its so well studied that the easy questions have been answered now were down to the more complicated issues
8702663 the countries of east asia are important drivers of growth with large consumption to drive global economies
8702664 it took six years for india to understand the sensitivities of asean and for the asean to understand the sensitivities of india
8702665 it is important to note that the holed up militants were echoing mehbooba mufti of pdp and omar abdullah of national conference nc and other separatist organisations by pointing towards the so called economic blockade and atrocities in kashmir
8702666 we dont know for sure because nobody is keeping tabs of the dead
8702667 what we do know is we have 155 live penguins we are treating for oil intoxication
8702668 the raid on bukharis residence in the guise of searching for wanted leaders was also aimed at looking for papers and documents which would have been gathered by bukhari in the course of his journalistic work

8702672 kamal nath has said something but as a central minister i want to make it clear that the union government will not take the responsibility of bailing out the west bengal government from the singur crisis
8702673 christian families continue to be holed up in the forests and we are making all out efforts to bring them back yesterday we rescued such a group and had also taken into custody 75 people who were trying to set ablaze a house
8702674 though tension prevails in some remote areas the situation has been brought under control in 6 to 7 out of the 12 blocks of the district
8702675 the package announced by the prime minister is satisfactory at the moment to tackle the gigantic task of reaching relief to over 20 lakh people affected by the floods in the four district with the kosi changing course inundating vast areas
8702676 apart from the estimated due of rs 2500 crores the state spent on providing relief to the flood hit areas in bihar during last years rainy season we will require more assistance from the centre for reconstructing villages run camps for relief for the next three to four months construct sanitary toilets and solve housing problems
8702677 we have to be ready for sheltering more than 10 lakh people in mega relief camps as polythenesheets cant serve the purpose
8702678 thank you thank the god above that we are safe it is as if we are reborn
8702679 our hope for survival is receding fast i dont know if i will be able to speak to you again
8702680 we shout from the rooftop at the sight of every boat that passes from a distance but nobody listens there is no relief only the sight of airforce helicopters flying about we are doomed
8702681 i had to pay rs 4000 to a local boatman for ferrying myself and family hardly a couple of kilometres the local strongmen who own boats are fleecing the already miserable flood victims
8702682 we are fast running out of supplies and have received no relief from the government in a couple of days we may begin to starve
8702683 anwar whatever we think of him and many of us are deeply skeptical is looking more and more like our future prime minister
8702684 there is a mounting sense of inevitability to his impending succession
8702685 the honourable president of india pratibha devisingh patil will give away 54th national film awards to the winners in presence of i amp b minister p r dasmunsi on september 2 2008 at vigyan bhavan in new delhi
8702686 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16 less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8702687 in the general population the statin discontinuation rate within the first year of prescription is 30 percent thats very high
8702688 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami
8702689 the rise of the indian american is one of the best kept secrets in american political life said event chair anurag varma
8702690 is that the obama campaign looks to our community to open our minds and heart and not just open our wallets
8702691 barack obama is someone rooted in his identity but not confined by it
8702692 we too are rooted in our origins as indian americans but are not confined by them
8702693 both raj goyle and i were elected to districts that were overwhelmingly caucasian and overwhelming republican
8702694 the support of iali has given us all a leg up indian americans are on the rise you see us gaining strength and gaining institutional capacity
8702695 instead of being atms for other candidates we have to have our own candidates
8702696 i attended my first convention in 1988 at that time you could count the number of indian american delegates on your fingers
8702697 biden has shown that he is close to the indian american community
8702698 a lot of senators took the opportunity then to attack india
8702699 but joe biden fought back and he held his ground for eight hours
8702700 indian americans play a vital role in the life of our nation and the health of our democracy the rise of indian american democrats did not happen by accident perhaps these pages include a future democratic president of the united states

8702704 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8702716 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8702717 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8702718 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8702719 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8702720 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8702727 la discipline de son lectorat et de son appareil militant
8702728 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
8702729 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
8702730 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
8702731 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca
8702732 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
8702733 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
8702734 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
8702735 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
8702736 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
8702737 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
8702738 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
8702739 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
8702740 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
8702741 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
8702742 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
8702743 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
8702744 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
8702745 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
8702746 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
8702747 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
8702748 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
8702749 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
8702750 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
8702751 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
8702752 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
8702753 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
8702754 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
8702755 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
8702756 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
8702757 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
8702758 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
8702759 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
8702760 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
8702761 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family

8702772 this follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value i think what were seeing is evolutionary
8702773 what were dealing with here is a use of the technology that i dont think the good people at magellan or garmin or tomtom really thought about when they were developing it
8702774 typically the gps data being used is for the purpose of contradicting defendants alibis
8702775 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8702776 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8702777 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing
8702778 were glad to see were in the forecast path because they never get it right this far out
8702779 i say that slightly tongue in cheek but its true
8702780 its important for us to see what is out there
8702781 we want to make sure that our standards and practices are the leading edge practices and that we leave no stone unturned to make sure that the propane facilities are very safe to operate in ontario and that the public is safe
8702782 for the public to have confidence in the public safety system the mcguinty government should have been out front on this
8702783 but its a government that doesnt like to take the blame so theyre shirking their responsibilities and im very disappointed in them
8702784 he understood that to truly fulfil our national dream we must accept the challenges and seize the opportunities presented by our north
8702785 as prime minister diefenbaker said as he stood here in 1961 there is a new world emerging above the arctic circle
8702786 hes certainly the liberal leader who has taken his party farthest to the left since mr trudeau if not farther than mr trudeau
8702787 the fact that mr dion opposes any expenditure management in any area of government indicates to us obviously why we have increasingly little common ground in parliament with mr dion and where he is taking the liberal party but more importantly it indicates a direction for the country that i dont think canadians are prepared to accept
8702788 were not saying we dont welcome more federal infrastructure military development
8702789 if were not going to get our kids through school the involvement of inuit in economic development will continue to be slow
8702790 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8702791 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by five 10 15 cents a gallon
8702792 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 per cent
8702793 i have spent long periods of time with him in the past two years hes been alert hes been steady
8702794 the late prime minister bhutto or her husband or it was a joint account
8702795 i think hes better than many of the others out there plus he was the husband of benazir bhutto who dreamed of a prosperous pakistan hell live out her dream or at least hell try

8702806 obamites believe their candidates speech will herald a crack in time
8702807 the democrats now patch dr kings speech into the prologue to the book of obama
8702808 if black america fails to configure its human organizational and material resources to effectively resist the theft and ultimate disfigurement of new orleans then we will be forced to confront the existence of fundamental crippling flaws in the african american polity
8702809 the last chance to build a real movement encompassing the broadest sectors of black america
8702810 the congressional black caucus which claims to be the conscience of the congress has shown itself to be an appendage of the white house leadership
8702811 they slavishly followed minority leader nancy pelosis command to make the democratic party look good as opposed to the republicans rather than directly address the crisis that was affecting their own people
8702812 forty one of the forty two black members of congress obeyed pelosis edict that the house committee on katrina be boycotted they accepted the order that democratic legislators would not attend the meetings of the katrina committee because it was stacked against the democratic party
8702813 the cbc as a body weighed compliance with their party leader versus rescue of black new orleans and chose pelosi
8702814 corporate planners and developers believed they had been blessed by nature when katrina drowned new orleans washing away in days the problem people and neighborhoods that would ordinarily require years to remove in order to clear the way for renaissance greed led to unseemly speed revealing in a flash the outlines of the urban vision that would be imposed on the wreckage of new orleans as in a film on fast forward the plot in both meanings of the word unfolded in a rush before our eyes once the black and poor were removed an urban environment would be created implacably hostile to their return the public sector except that which serves business directly or indirectly would under no circumstances be resurrected so as to leave little space for the re implantation of unwanted populations schools utility infrastructure public and affordable private housing public safety health care
8702815 no renters have gotten anything from the 10 billion road home community block grant
8702816 theres been much attention in the press about the fact that those who were left behind in new orleans were disproportionately poor and african american ive said publicly that i do not subscribe to the notion that the painfully slow response of fema and the department of homeland security was racially based the ineptitude was colorblind
8702817 i see no evidence of active malice but i see a continuation of passive indifference on the part of our government towards the least of these
8702818 barack obama will do nothing to facilitate the return of black new orleans
8702819 the seven cities that became less black in the nineties new york chicago houston los angeles washington dallas atlanta are all concentrated corporate headquarters locations or in the case of washington dc the headquarters of the federal government these are places that corporate and finance capital are most keen to make over in order to provide the urban ambience believed most amenable to their employees management and clients and for the general sake of corporate prestige

8702821 have you seen the news there was an immigration raid yesterday at 10am they have some 400 detainees here well be working late conducting initial appearances for the next few days

8702825 i walked for a month and ten days until i crossed the river
8702826 i just wanted to work a year or two save and then go back to my family but it was not to be
8702827 the good lord knows i was just working and not doing anyone any harm
8702828 god knows you are just doing your job to support your families and that job is to keep me from supporting mine
8702829 i cannot be away from my children for so long
8702830 if you want to see your children or dont want your family to starve sign here
8702831 your honor you know that we are here because of the need of our families i beg that you find it in your heart to send us home before too long because we have a responsibility to our children to give them an education clothing shelter and food
8702832 i appreciate the fact that you are very hard working people who have come here to do no harm and i thank you for coming to this country to work hard unfortunately you broke a law in the process and now i have the obligation to give you this sentence but i hope that the u s government has at least treated you kindly and with respect and that this time goes by quickly for you so that soon you may be reunited with your family and friends
8702833 your honor i am concerned from my attorney client interviews that many of these people are clearly not guilty and yet they have no choice but to plead out
8702834 you know i dont agree with any of this or with the way it is being done in fact i ruled in a previous case that to charge somebody with identity theft the person had to at least know of the real owner of the social security number but i was reverted in another district and yet upheld in a third
8702835 however the numbers did not match the name of the employee reported by agriprocessors
8702836 this analysis would not account for the possibility that a person may have falsely used the identity of an actual persons name and ssn
8702837 in my training and expertise i know it is not uncommon for aliens to purchase identity documents which include ssns that match the name assigned to the number
8702838 the search revealed that a person who was assigned one of the social security numbers used by an employee of agriprocessors has reported his her identity being stolen
8702839 on april 16 2008 the us filed criminal complaints against 697 employees charging them with unlawfully using ssns in violation of title 42 usc 408 a 7 b aggravated identity theft in violation of 18 usc 1028a a 1 and or possession or use of false identity documents for purposes of employment in violation of 18 usc 1546

8702843 in fy07 ice human trafficking investigations resulted in 164 arrests and 91 convictions
8702844 ice has introduced an aggressive and effective campaign to enforce immigration law within the nations interior with a top level focus on criminal aliens fugitive aliens and those who pose a threat to the safety of the american public and the stability of american communities
8702845 in fy07 ice enacted a multi year strategy worksite enforcement initiatives that target employers who defy immigration law and the
8702846 knowingly possessing or using false employment documents with intent to deceive
8702847 in fy07 ice dramatically increased penalties against employers whose hiring processes violated the law securing fines and judgments of more than 30 million
8702848 these incarcerated aliens have been involved in dangerous criminal activity such as murder predatory sexual offenses narcotics trafficking alien smuggling and a host of other crimes
8702849 these additional personnel move ice closer to target staffing levels
8702850 in fy07 one of ices key accomplishments was the mobile continuity of operations emergency response pilot project which entails the deployment of a fleet of trailers outfitted with emergency supplies pre positioned at ice locations nationwide for ready deployment in the event of a nearby emergency situation
8702851 had this effort been in place prior to 9 11 all of the hijackers who failed to maintain status would have been investigated months before the attack

8703090 el siervo es primero que todo siervo por naturaleza es un asunto de lo que l es no de lo que l hace
8703091 como ustedes saben entre los paganos los jefes gobiernan con tiran a a sus s bditos y los grandes hacen sentir su autoridad sobre ellos pero entre ustedes no debe ser as al contrario el que entre ustedes quiera ser grande deber servir a los dem s y el que entre ustedes quiera ser el primero deber ser su esclavo porque del mismo modo el hijo del hombre no vino para que le sirvan sino para servir y para dar su vida en rescate por una multitud

8703162 not only students but professionals and professors are beginning to commute by bike some to the extent of selling their cars and relying solely on their bikes for transportation

8703179 grammar schools are good schools there are 164 of them and they have nothing to fear from a conservative government the fact is you wont get the change we need if the limit of your ambitions is a few more grammar schools here and there which by the way isnt going to happen anyway as no one has set any up even during eighteen years of conservative government if youre serious about giving every child in our country the opportunity they deserve youve got to think way way bigger than grammar schools youve got to be prepared to completely transform our education system so that you dont just allow those failing schools to continue youve got to be as radical in school reform as mrs thatcher was for example in trade union reform
8703180 we think the evidence shows that its good for kids to be taught at the right level for their ability and have streaming for better results so thats definitely something we want to encourage but we dont think selection between schools is the way forward what you really need is parents choosing schools not schools choosing pupils if you look across the world where school reform has worked best is in places like sweden and the chartered schools in america
8703181 i suppose one of my formative influences was going to see the tabernacle school in notting hill which was a school set up by frustrated teachers and parents because they were so hacked off with low standards and poor discipline at state schools particularly with young black boys and they showed me what could be done if you set up a school from scratch by yourself the tragedy is that the school had to be in the private sector but why why couldnt it be in the state sector
8703182 i do have a very traditional view of education i really feel you have to get the basics in place im very much a traditionalist when it comes to teaching methods testing examining
8703183 there are one or two important things i want to get straight in the conservative party and one is when it comes to the health service were about improving it for everybody were not about trying to find ways to help people opt out of the health service with tax breaks and private medical care its really important to get this across to people the nhs should be for everyone
8703184 there have been endless top down structural upheavals just wasting time and money and the goodwill of nhs staff sometimes i think this labour government is just run by management consultants they havent got a clue about what really matters they just think about what looks efficient on a powerpoint chart
8703185 look if youre running any organisation like a hospital you need to have some ways to measure progress and to motivate your staff i think whats wrong is the idea of targets handed down from whitehall for the whole of the nhs what weve said is that we need to measure the results not the processes and so were going to get rid of top down process targets and instead focus on what really matters which is are people getting better are they getting high quality treatment
8703186 in one sense it will never be solved because in any developed country the demand for more health care will exceed the supply but i think we could do a lot better than we are today
8703187 john mccain said to me and i completely agree with him that weve got to get the argument about the environment exactly right weve got to tell people its not about wearing a jersey and sitting in the dark with the lights of shivering britain needs high speed rail to replace short haul flights it means integrating much better with trains and planes and automobiles as it were

8703257 the coaching staff there is awesome coach vaughn when he was down here recruiting me we had a good conversation he did not put any pressure on me to commit he just said i could be a big part of his offense

8703312 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
8703313 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
8703314 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it
8703315 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling
8703316 a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work
8703317 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products
8703318 sometimes you feel like youre in line with the soup nazi
8703319 its a really good deal to be part of the apple thing and you dont want to say anything to rock the boat no soup for you your apps are gone

8703330 the physical removal of abc reporter asa eslocker from public property and his subsequent arrest are a blatant assault on the first amendment arresting a reporter for simply doing his job is both unconstitutional and un american that free speech is curtailed during the democratic convention underscores the need for continued protection of civil liberties regardless of the party in power
8703331 the use of unnecessary force and the arrest of a journalist who was reporting an important political story is deeply troubling and unacceptable
8703332 the attempts at intimidation that were evident in the captured images of eslockers arrest simply because he refused to leave a shared publicly used space reflect negatively on the denver police and sheriffs departments commitment to uphold a journalists right to gather important news
8703333 the goal is to create cells that are missing or defective in people its very exciting
8703334 it didnt cure the mouse but they were able to reduce their blood sugar levels to near normal
8703335 the presently accepted regenerative medicine idea is that you make a stem cell from a patient bring it back to the beginning as it were then you are left with the problem of how to instruct that cell to become a beta cell or a motor neuron
8703336 we asked the simple question why should you have to go all the way back to the beginning could you go from one cell type to another
8703337 i would say within five years we could be ready to start human trials

8703359 canada has one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world but it can always be better
8703360 thats why we are investing 113 million in canadas food and consumer action plan and hired 200 more inspectors with more to come in this fiscal year
8703361 we have an inspector in place on a daily basis when the plant is running to oversee the production process
8703362 while others characterize that as paperwork i characterize that as an important part of an effective inspection system the review of results from testing records and cooking temperature employed in a plant are fundamental that the processes employed by the plant are in control
8703363 we have an unwavering commitment to keep our food safe and we have excellent systems and processes in place but this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
8703364 canada has one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world
8703365 this is a terrible tragedy and the system failed we will fix it

8703367 the battle will not be over what happened in selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of america it is the effort of american negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of american life
8703368 their cause must be our cause too because it is not just negroes but really it is all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice
8703369 most important of all barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are first strong at home
8703370 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8703371 the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here
8703372 and so my fellow americans ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country
8703373 my fellow democrats 16 years ago you gave me the profound honor to lead our party to victory together we prevailed in a hard campaign in which republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar

8703375 you cant find a goddam piece of good news anywhere whats happening to this country
8703376 consistent revenue streams even in times of wider economic uncertainty
8703377 weve done more than any other track in the country to address sound
8703378 its absolutely gorgeous the most beautiful thing youve ever seen
8703379 its almost like bruton said im not worried about making money i just want everyone to have a good time its going to go over like gangbusters
8703380 its got so much buzz and everyone is so excited the position on the calendar isnt going to hurt thatll add a lot of drama and make it such a big spectacle
8703381 weve built this to the specs of our nicest nascar facilities from the restrooms to the skyboxes to the concourses the finish work is amazing bruton felt it was that important to move drag racing to the next level
8703382 you can bring sponsors and they can walk outside to hear feel and smell the cars
8703383 operationally we have a lot to learn and trying to go four lanes out of the box would be difficult
8703384 weve agreed to reconvene after the national event and figure out a way to run them theres too much upside
8703385 i cant thank roger enough for bringing this race back and making some great improvements it was a fantastic event last year and i expect it to only improve
8703386 without a transfer agreement you have no certainty so theres more speculation when it comes to drafting a european player specifically a russian player
8703387 if youre going to make that kind of commitment you really have to have an intimate knowledge of the player what his commitment is to come over what his contractual status is because youre taking a chance
8703388 there are still a lot of barriers for the russians that come over here especially the obvious ones like getting used to the language and getting used to the customs
8703389 i always found that the russians were just a different breed
8703390 i dont know if youd call it pride or what but i found when i was coaching that if you piqued that pride theyd get a little upset i dont think the skins of russians are as thick as other guys
8703391 its not because theyre not good players because most russian players have tremendous skills
8703392 but the way things are set up right now i just dont think a lot of teams are willing to take the chance on them
8703393 senator obama this is truly a good day for america too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done

8703409 some of its embarrassing and some of its better than you thought some of it should be burned
8703410 some french tv special and then going to do another festival in japan thats what i did for years and theres a point where you start to feel stunted
8703411 it is a bit random what ends up getting released and what stays in the can
8703412 some of its embarrassing and some of its better than you thought some of it should be burned
8703413 im really excited about beck because he hasnt been at the festival in a really long time
8703414 at the time we booked him we didnt know he was going to have a new album it was a surprise after wed already confirmed him so theres new music and i think people are really excited about that
8703415 i think its a good thing to have death cab closing out monday night because theyre been playing the festival since they started
8703416 were a city festival and theyre a really important seattle band its fun for us to watch bands start on the smaller stages and then become headliners
8703417 i love his podcasts because he always has guests that are so compatible with everything we do at bumbershoot whether its musical guests or comedy guests
8703418 hes going to be doing his show and taping it live all three days during the festival
8703419 strange fruit is a troupe weve been looking at for years but because theyre in australia its always been hard to get them over here
8703420 theres a very healthy number of people under 18 and theres a lot of people in the 35 to 45 range too so the top and bottom numbers are probably near the fringe and the bulk is probably falling in the middle
8703421 we pick different people and theyll usually come in for a maximum of two years at a time its a diverse group of people from both music and the arts
8703422 the high school age people have become a large part of the patronage of the festival so if youre not talking to them youre not going to know what theyre interested in
8703423 thats how the comedy pass program evolved this year we definitely take their programming suggestions to heart
8703424 the deal was set up to financially protect the festival you can have one bad year of rain and were a nonprofit festivals are really risky business
8703425 aeg is really hands off with us their intention from the beginning was not for us to change the way we do anything theyve been very true to that promise theyve definitely helped us out in some sponsorship areas and theyre supportive of what we want to do they have no interest in changing our artistic direction and what we want to book
8703426 were trying to do a safe fun festival for everybody weve created hydration stations in the stadium where you can fill up your non disposable bottle for free and weve clearly identified other places around the grounds where you can get free water during the weekend
8703427 we had initially contemplated a written report but mr lee announced his retirement before that report was produced
8703428 involved the operations and management of the department there were a variety of issues i was looking at
8703429 expressed to me concerns that this was a foregone conclusion that this was a witch hunt and so on
8703430 i worked very hard to be as objective as i could be so if it came to a point where decisions were going to be made it could be done in the most fair way possible
8703431 terry and rick made their decisions about retirement for their own reasons
8703432 and where we go from here remains to be seen
8703433 current congestion and safety for motorists pedestrians and bicyclists are the main concerns
8703434 the end result will be a safer and easier accessible stretch of road for everyone
8703435 ill probably take side streets whenever possible when driving to work to avoid as much construction as possible
8703436 that might use a little extra gas but it will be worth it not to have to deal with the aggravation
8703437 i watch people turn left out of our parking lot every day and most people cut it very close
8703438 if they cant turn left there wont be as many accidents
8703439 trying to turn across traffic from a lane or trying to get across traffic from any of the plazas is a bit nerve wracking
8703440 i think the medians and the u turn lanes will be helpful
8703441 the construction was not the main cause for the store closing but it was certainly a factor
8703442 it had a substantial impact on the number of customers that wanted to deal with the construction and come to our store i am nervous that the same thing will happen again
8703443 we are trying to make this a public process by working with businesses that will be affected by the construction
8703444 we hope that they will see the overall picture with the end result being easier access to their stores for customers
8703445 even though the end result of the construction might mean less accidents and possibly more customers trying to survive two years in this economy is going to be very difficult
8703446 expectations for instantaneous results i think are probably a little bit too high
8703447 i came away from the meeting very encouraged that the focus is where it needs to be
8703448 were trying to figure out how that fits into bringing pressure onto that border to minimize the cross border operations from pakistan
8703449 while our subsidiary bank is well capitalized and we continue to serve the financial needs of our communities given the uncertainties in the economy and the decline in our earnings we are suspending our quarterly dividend until our earnings improve
8703450 the current economic conditions with high rates of unemployment and declining real estate values have had a negative impact on earnings for most banks including us although our capital ratios remain well above the regulatory minimums our dividend payments exceeded our earnings for the last three quarters we feel its prudent to proactively strengthen our capital base further in preparation for continued economic weakness we recently celebrated our 150th anniversary our strong capital position has enabled us to survive many difficult times in the past and our commitment to protecting this strength will serve us well through this challenging period
8703451 no the flu mutates every season so the 1918 flu is probably long gone in nature

8703457 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8703458 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing
8703459 hi how are you would you like to try some mineral makeup
8703460 mr goodman who helped craft sen john mccains health care policy said anyone with access to an emergency room effectively has insurance albeit the government acts as the payer of last resort hospital emergency rooms by law cannot turn away a patient in need of immediate care
8703461 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8703462 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american
8703463 as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8703464 ik ben erg ongelukkig met de film ik heb niet n sc ne kunnen doen zoals dei in het script stond of zoals ik die eruit wilde laten zien het script werd niet gerespecteerd de producers waren slecht de mensen waren we mee samen werkten waren slecht het was een verschrikkelijke ervaring
8703465 ik vind de energie die erin zit tof en er zijn ook sc nes waar ik wel tevreden over ben maar ik weet dat ik iets veel beters in mijn handen had dat ik niet mocht realiseren ik kan me niet voorstellen dat het publiek dat deze zomer geweldige blockbusters als iron man en the dark knight heeft voorgeschoteld gekregen hier tevreden mee zal zijn

8703537 17 for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john and bound him in prison for herodias sake his brother philips wife for he had married her 18 for john had said unto herod it is not lawful for thee to have thy brothers wife
8703538 13 and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in capernaum which is upon the sea coast in the borders of zabulon and nephthalim
8703539 14 now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god
8703540 to herald to proclaim but what was the message jesus proclaimed is it a message we should be preach today from our text mk 1 14 15 we first see that 14 now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god 15 and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel

8703542 36 jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence
8703543 17 for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost
8703544 12 that ye would walk worthy of god who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory
8703545 6 and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever amen
8703546 9 i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ
8703547 34 then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world
8703548 50 now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither doth corruption inherit incorruption
8703549 18 and the lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory for ever and ever amen
8703550 10 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall 11 for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ
8703551 1 and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place 2 and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting 3 and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them 4 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance 5 and there were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven 6 now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language 7 and they were all amazed and marvelled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galilaeans 8 and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born 9 parthians and medes and elamites and the dwellers in mesopotamia and in judaea and cappadocia in pontus and asia 10 phrygia and pamphylia in egypt and in the parts of libya about cyrene and strangers of rome jews and proselytes 11 cretes and arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of god 12 and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meaneth this 13 others mocking said these men are full of new wine 14 but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of judaea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words 15 for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day 16 but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel 17 and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams 18 and on my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy 19 and i will shew wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapour of smoke 20 the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and notable day of the lord come 21 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved 22 ye men of israel hear these words jesus of nazareth a man approved of god among you by miracles and wonders and signs which god did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know 23 him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain 24 whom god hath raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holden of it 25 for david speaketh concerning him i foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that i should not be moved 26 therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope 27 because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption 28 thou hast made known to me the ways of life thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance 29 men and brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch david that he is both dead and buried and his sepulchre is with us unto this day 30 therefore being a prophet and knowing that god had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up christ to sit on his throne 31 he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of christ that his soul was not left in hell neither his flesh did see corruption 32 this jesus hath god raised up whereof we all are witnesses 33 therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear 34 for david is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand 35 until i make thy foes thy footstool 36 therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made the same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ 37 now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do 38 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost 39 for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call 40 and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation 41 then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls 42 and they continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers 43 and fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles 44 and all that believed were together and had all things common 45 and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need 46 and they continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart 47 praising god and having favour with all the people and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved
8703552 new heaven and a new earth in which righteousness dwells
8703553 1 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea 2 and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband 3 and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god 4 and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away 5 and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful 6 and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely 7 he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son 8 but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death 9 and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will shew thee the bride the lambs wife 10 and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and shewed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god 11 having the glory of god and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as crystal 12 and had a wall great and high and had twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels and names written thereon which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of israel 13 on the east three gates on the north three gates on the south three gates and on the west three gates 14 and the wall of the city had twelve foundations and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb 15 and he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city and the gates thereof and the wall thereof 16 and the city lieth foursquare and the length is as large as the breadth and he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal 17 and he measured the wall thereof an hundred and forty and four cubits according to the measure of a man that is of the angel 18 and the building of the wall of it was of jasper and the city was pure gold like unto clear glass 19 and the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones the first foundation was jasper the second sapphire the third a chalcedony the fourth an emerald 20 the fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius the seventh chrysolyte the eighth beryl the ninth a topaz the tenth a chrysoprasus the eleventh a jacinth the twelfth an amethyst 21 and the twelve gates were twelve pearls every several gate was of one pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glass 22 and i saw no temple therein for the lord god almighty and the lamb are the temple of it 23 and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof 24 and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it 25 and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day for there shall be no night there 26 and they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it 27 and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the lambs book of life
8703554 1 and he shewed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb 2 in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the tree of life which bare twelve manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations 3 and there shall be no more curse but the throne of god and of the lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve him 4 and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads 5 and there shall be no night there and they need no candle neither light of the sun for the lord god giveth them light and they shall reign for ever and ever 6 and he said unto me these sayings are faithful and true and the lord god of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done 8 and i john saw these things and heard them and when i had heard and seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things 9 then saith he unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship god 10 and he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand 11 he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still 12 and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be 13 i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last 14 blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city 15 for without are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie 16 i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright and morning star 17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely 18 for i testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book 19 and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book 20 he which testifieth these things saith surely i come quickly amen even so come lord jesus 21 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen
8703555 21 not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven 22 many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works 23 and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity
8703556 13 nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness 14 wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless
8703557 8 and he went into the synagogue and spake boldly for the space of three months disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of god
8703558 preaching the kingdom of and now behold i know that ye all among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god shall see my face no more
8703559 30 and paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house and received all that came in unto him 31 preaching the kingdom of god and teaching those things which concern the lord jesus christ with all confidence no man forbidding him
8703560 17 for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost
8703561 21 envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god
8703562 5 for this ye know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god
8703563 24 then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power 25 for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet 26 the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death
8703564 50 now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither doth corruption inherit incorruption
8703565 13 who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son
8703566 11 and jesus which is called justus who are of the circumcision these only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of god which have been a comfort unto me
8703567 12 that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness
8703568 18 and the lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory for ever and ever amen
8703569 28 wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear
8703570 5 hearken my beloved brethren hath not god chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him
8703571 10 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall 11 for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ
8703572 9 i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ
8703573 14 now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god 15 and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel
8703574 44 and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand for ever
8703575 18 and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth
8703576 20 which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places 21 far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come 22 and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church
8703577 47 praising god and having favour with all the people and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved
8703578 9 i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ
8703579 22 confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god
8703580 10 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall 11 for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ
8703581 18 and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth
8703582 e se il vecchio entrasse improvvisamente chi sarebbe il primo a subirne la sua follia stupratrice
8703583 it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick i have not come to call the righteous but sinners
8703584 de studio wist heel goed dat de autos niet deugden er was zelfs een interne memo geweest die stelde dat het traliewerk van de autos niet voldeed aan huidige veiligheidsnormen
8703585 by the realization that guant namo was a strategic failure
8703586 all of us in the discussion agreed that guant namo was not working for lots of reasons and that the simplest way to proceed is that when you have foreign fighters captured you send them back home
8703587 if you dont send them to gitmo and the c i a doesnt want them then where do you put them
8703588 monitored by d o d personnel and their conduct must be consistent with d o d policy
8703589 the u s has aggressively looked for opportunities to repatriate detainees
8703590 in countries where we know they have a program to rehabilitate detainees like saudi arabia weve had good success
8703591 what you have is a situation in which the u s wants to get all the saudi prisoners to saudi arabia because the saudis know how to deal with them
8703592 when it comes to sending people back home there is really no way for us to find out how they are doing
8703593 its the kind of action that if it leaks can cause political reverberations in the street there were qualities of imperial hubris that i thought were wrong
8703594 when you think that you are referring to your intuition actually you just learn an association between subliminal signals in your context and the outcome of your actions
8703595 this might now provide an explanation why we often base our decisions on intuitive hunches where a certain option somehow feels right
8703596 but we shouldnt be worried that we could be influenced against our will by such unconscious processes the study shows that the unconscious brain is intelligent enough to select the best options
8703597 our prospect is not to help advertisers take advantage of consumers
8703598 we hope to attract a great number of customers who will be able to see the whole city and enjoy the restaurants and pools on ground below
8703599 the city of baghdad has a depth of history and a cultural legacy that when applied to the development can be a basis for attracting and fostering tourism
8703600 at 7pm hmm so basically we met up with everyone late as usual lol x haha
8703601 you dont actually understand what love is because you dont get it blah blah blah my knowledge of what
8703602 we also stand a very good chance this time around to elect a us senator
8703603 when you see democrats winning special elections in mississippi and louisiana that went for bush at a 60 percent clip four years ago its clear thats the 50 state strategy paying off
8703604 states like north dakota and montana are now legitimately up for grabs
8703605 voter registration here has shot off the scale weve registered republicans and turned them blue weve registered independents and turned them blue so yeah we can turn this state blue
8703606 that may have pushed this fundamentalist right wing religious part of the republican message just one step too far for the more libertarian kind of conservatives in the western part of the country
8703607 voters in the west are probably less attached to the two political parties and feel a little further from washington and the political fights that go on here
8703608 the people in the intermountain west as they focus on the issues they care about will recognize that senator mccain is right for america and barack obama as well meaning as he is is wrong for america
8703609 i dont think it will be quite as dramatic as that but you are seeing a realignment underway in the western states and in the upper south
8703610 ive come up against incredible odds my whole life and i dont believe in writing anything off were not giving up anything here were going to do the best we can with what we have
8703611 negroes whether slaves or free that is men of the african race are not citizens of the united states by the constitution
8703612 during fiscal 2008 we focused on operational excellence and successfully built a strong foundation for sustained long term growth for example fourth quarter solar gross margin improved to 33 5 percent compared with 15 8 percent last year sg amp a as a percent of revenue in the fourth quarter declined to 16 9 percent from 30 8 percent a year ago as a result we achieved profitability from operations for the second half of fiscal 2008
8703613 fiscal 2008 marked a major transition in ecds history as the company generated positive operating cash flow of 28 5 million during the year a significant improvement from the negative 21 8 million in fiscal 2007 we also completed an important capital raise that will allow us to fund our expansion to 1gw of capacity by the end of fiscal 2012 the selection of uni solar to power the worlds largest rooftop solar installation validates our continued success at selling differentiated value proposition into new and expanding markets and distribution channels in the rooftop and building integrated pv markets i am confident that our growth and momentum will continue into fiscal 2009 and beyond
8703614 the inspector general for the u s commodity futures regulator has officially begun an investigation into an inter agency report on commodity markets the wall street journal said citing a person close to the matter
8703615 there doesnt appear to be any catalyst for the gains
8703616 market breadth is positive although conviction behind the market is unclear
8703617 how unscrupulous campaign strategists are taking advantage of a quirk in our brains and what reporters can do to stop helping them
8703618 the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market
8703619 journalists should avoid presenting both sides of a story when one is false
8703620 to maintain consumer confidence in the food supply eliminate further misunderstanding of the rule and ultimately to make a positive impact on the humane handling of cattle i believe it is sound policy to simplify this matter by initiating a complete ban on the slaughter of downer cattle
8703621 prohibition of the use of specified risk materials for human food and requirements for the disposition of non ambulatory disabled cattle prohibition of the use of certain stunning devices used to immobilize cattle during slaughter
8703622 maka datanglah sesudah mereka pengganti yang jelek yang menyia nyiakan shalat dan memperturutkan hawa nafsunya maka kelak mereka akan menemui kesesatan kecuali orang orang yang bertaubat dan beramal shalih
8703623 sesungguhnya mereka adalah orang orang yang bersegera dalam mengerjakan perbuatan perbuatan baik dan mereka berdoa kepada kami dengan harap dan cemas dan mereka adalah orang orang yang khusyu kepada kami
8703624 orang kuat bukanlah orang yang selalu menang ketika berkelahi tapi orang yang kuat adalah orang yang bisa menguasai diri ketika marah
8703625 barangsiapa tidak meninggalkan perkataan dusta perbuatan az zur maka allah tidak membutuhkan perbuatan orang yang tidak bersopan santun maka tiada hajat bagi allah padahal dia meninggalkan makan dan minumnya
8703626 barangsiapa menyambung tali persaudaraan silaturrahim di bulan ini allah akan menghubungkan dia dengan rahmat nya
8703627 maka apakah kamu mengira sesungguhnya kami menciptakan kamu secara main main saja dan kamu tidak akan dikembalikan kepada kami maka maha tinggi allah raja yang sebenarnya tidak tuhan yang berhak disembah selain dia tuhan yang mempunyai arsy yang mulia
8703628 im so afraid of that first walk out here i am alone naked to the world huh what do you think world do you forgive me
8703629 what you saw on tv with sonny and cher was a good representation of our personal life always laughing and having fun
8703630 the only way i could continue life happily was to split with sonny and bring our show to a premature end
8703631 this devastated our fans as well as cbs executives but it had to be done i was simply unhappy with my life
8703632 i will never forget the time silkwood premiered in new york as soon as my name was mentioned the audience laughed i felt so bad but you know you cant argue with these things its just a natural organic response from the audience
8703633 i was in london in january 1998 when i heard the dreaded news chastity rang me and brought the news of sonnys death i dropped everything and fled to heathrow airport and the media watched my every move even though we had been apart for over 24 years i couldnt ignore the fact that i spent a quarter of my life with this guy
8703634 porque la ira de dios se revela desde el cielo contra toda impiedad e injusticia de los hombres que detienen con injusticiala verdad
8703635 its not even really a metaphor for slavery slavery is whats going on
8703636 i would truthfully say that angola prison is a sophisticated plantation
8703637 cotton is king still applies when it come to angola
8703638 allows inmates to be trained in work habits and allows them to develop marketable skills in the areas of farming animal husbandry vegetable meat and milk processing
8703639 the warden says it takes good food good medicine good prayin and good playin to have a good prison
8703640 in the conventional plantations slaves were given just enough food clothing and shelter to be a financial asset to the owner the same is true for the louisiana prison system
8703641 prisoners worked out in the field sometimes 17 hours straight rain or shine
8703642 theyd tell you the officer was always right no matter what
8703643 neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime where of the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the united states
8703644 prisoners can be forced to work for the government against their will and this is true in every state
8703645 i would have more faith in that amendment if it werent so clear that our criminal justice system is racially biased in a really obvious way
8703646 i dont have any illusions that this is a simple process
8703647 many people are apathetic about what happens in prisons it would be very difficult but i would not suggest it would be impossible
8703648 many black inmates viewed farm work under these circumstances as too close to slavery to want to participate
8703649 theyve got a lot of land to bury a lot of prisoners
8703650 as a small but very important contribution towards the efforts being made by the government
8703651 the efforts were inadequate to protect the school children and their teachers from heavy downpours and unbearable heat
8703652 school children and their teachers need an environment that is conducive to learning to growth and development
8703653 education is the bedrock of human development and serves as a parameter for any growth in society
8703654 as the first major efforts put in place in the twelve years of the schools existence

8703713 i think its a global destination i think its not just a domestic american crowd that would want to come i like the idea that people will travel from around the world and vegas seems to be the place where a lot of people want to go
8703714 vegas is to america what ibiza is to europe top five for partying bottom five for culture

8703745 whatever things are true whatever things are noble whatever things are just whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely whatever things are of good report if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy meditate on these things

8703762 the modern uranium mining industry is a safe process its a well managed process and its well understood and theres a lot of understanding of the environment and the management that goes into it
8703763 napperby like any uranium mining operation has to follow the government approvals both in the territory government and in the federal government sphere
8703764 we will ban by legislation the mining of uranium in western australia and instead we will drive 100 per cent renewable energy production

8703766 theres almost a doubling of nuclear power happening around the world so to make a statement that much of the world is moving away it almost seems like its come purely from an anti nuclear lobby
8703767 this administration has been trying to have it get done
8703768 this is a very critical issue to international security and president george w bush and secretary condoleezza rice both have sprinted to finish it and the secretary and president are working very very hard

8703790 we have to protect the beauty of florida but we also need to have people have the opportunity to drive here and be able to afford to do that too
8703791 we hear that theres new technology we hear there are new processes we hear everything is a lot safer and rather than kind of rush to judgment based on past fears we want to take a close look
8703792 these are people who have been opposed to offshore drilling because they realize how important a clean environment is to our economy
8703793 but at the same time it doesnt help the tourism industry or the state economy to have gasoline prices in excess of 3 50 or 4 per gallon
8703794 weve always made the link that without our products tourism cant exist and operate in a proactive positive way in the state of florida and now i think they understand that in a much more obvious way than ever before
8703795 we are adamantly opposed to it now and in the future
8703796 i just dont see that theres a reward theres no balance between risk and rewards tourism is the no 1 driver of our economy not oil and we just cant take that risk
8703797 this coexistence is an exotic superconducting state that has not been observed in any other superconducting material
8703798 it shows a very strong link between superconductivity and magnetism
8703799 its not clear what the origin of this state is or what creates or modifies it
8703800 its really a question of the chicken and the egg
8703801 does superconductivity need magnetism in this state or does magnetism need superconductivity
8703802 this is a new paradigm for understanding the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity
8703803 it could help us find the basis for understanding unconventional high temperature superconductivity
8703804 dr rhinoceros or how i learned to stop worrying and love the charge
8703805 it comes from the name of a mix tape i made for a friend years ago
8703806 later i reappropriated it for my new project i liked that it seemed to disguise the solo nature of the recordings trying to give it a different sort of identity than a songwriters alias oftentimes goes for and i wanted to let it be fragmented and ambiguous enough to grow alongside the music as the songwriting would evolve and go in different directions i was also very tired of bands calling themselves the blanks

8703900 in considering the sanctions to impose i have been guided by the principle that the sanctions should address and be proportional to the specific findings of the research misconduct
8703901 following political pressure from congress motivated by articles in nature
8703902 the university system has failed miserably and taken the expedient way out
8703903 i have a right to appeal the findings along with seeking redress from the courts of the united states for the extensive damage caused to me and several others
8703904 given the way purdue administrators have handled this matter dr taleyarkhan has many options in the judicial system
8703905 after years of fighting and being overwhelmingly successful against his detractors he may not want a further part in this aspect
8703906 as the final two allegations have nothing to do with the science which as a consequence of this overall ordeal has been further vetted and strengthened in terms of its credibility
8703907 kirsten b her last name was there but i have moments of kindness and wont include it here just in case you know she finds me at the cock and decides to kick my kindergarten mom butt has a hairy back
8703908 lets all just sit here without talking and chug beers
8703909 next time im bringing a black sharpie marker from home
8703910 i think i like laid down and cried i was in shock it was very very exciting
8703911 i was a huge fan so it was very exciting i had watched most of the first season from the beginning and then i went back and re watched everything before i started filming
8703912 its amazing theyre so nice and so willing to work with you not just the cast but the crew too everyone has been very very cool and willing to listen to ideas and help me out
8703913 he can stop time but because im so fast i can move within his time stopped world
8703914 we sort of cancel each others powers out i can run around in his stopped world but i cant run at super speeds he cant do anything about it so its a good dynamic between the two of us hes constantly the good guy where as im more of the bad guy
8703915 i wouldnt say that deep down shes a terrible person or anything
8703916 shes no sylar but shes a thief i think in the end shes sort of an innocent shes been a thief for a long time shes been on her own and had to take care of herself now all of the sudden she is faced with these people who have these much bigger issues at stake and thats going to change the way she reacts to things but my character has many turns throughout the season there is much to look forward to
8703917 i think they had a much stronger idea of the character when i came in than even i did and now im gradually getting the hang of it
8703918 ive talked to a lot of the other people on heroes and they all say it took them like two seasons to meet everybody
8703919 ive been really fortunate i get to have scenes with a lot of different people for various reasons my character gets around a lot shes fast
8703920 the writers and producers and have really helped and been very hands on
8703921 weve talked about the physicality of it as well as there are just practical elements to it i have to run a certain way stop really quickly or stop on a dime taking the sharp corners in heels is the hardest part im not much of a heels girl normally im a much better runner i would say but the heels through me a bit
8703922 il paesaggio dal finestrino scorreva veloce non riuscivo a distinguere i singoli elementi di quella campagna era un po come la mia vita forse stavo correndo troppo forse stavo mischiando troppo le cose avevo creato solo una grande confusione e non riuscivo pi a distinguere il passato dal presente tutto quel verde che vedevo poteva contenere anche rami secchi erbaccia e quantaltro e quel cielo chiaro poteva contenere anche nuvoloni ostili lunica differenza in me era che tutta la confusione che avevo nella mente stava andando a mescolarsi con la confusione che avevo nel cuore avevo bisogno del mio espediente stabilizzante quello che fino a poco tempo prima era sempre presente quello che avevo colto con unaltra donna quello che era stato incastrato da lei per danneggiarmi quello che avevo perdonato ma quello a cui non riuscivo pi ad avvicinarmi senza ricordare la scena di loro due insieme avevo bisogno di joe ci dividevano quattro mesi un oceano e pi di diecimila chilometri
8703923 do not create copies as the copyright act defines that term
8703924 rather than attempting to address more far reaching questions better left to congress and the courts
8703925 the question of the copyright offices regulatory authority is unclear so it would be better served to let congress and the courts settle the buffer issue rather than enter a legal morass
8703926 this is one of the fundamental issues for the digital age and we think the legal process has already started to give us the answer to the question of the legal standing of buffer copies under copyright law
8703927 while the effort to streamline the business of digital music licensing is admirable the copyright office must take care not to substitute its own views on evolving copyright questions for those of the courts and congress
8703928 fortunately a cautious and narrow rulemaking can steer a middle course and we hope that the copyright office follows that path

8703944 even his lawyer said that would probably happen but it wasnt that way
8703945 tillman 20 put his hand over his face and shook his head when he was found guilty
8703946 a nexus was never established between defendant and either trotter or the two individuals apprehended in possession of the victims car
8703947 need only tend to confirm and inspire belief in the confession
8703948 the accuseds identity need not be corroborated by evidence apart from his own extrajudicial statements
8703949 his self described involvement to police is sufficient to establish his participation in the victims attack
8703950 that in the early to mid 1980s jon burge and many officers working under him regularly engaged in the physical abuse and torture of prisoners to extract confessions both internal police accounts and numerous lawsuits and appeals brought by suspects alleging such abuse substantiate that those beatings and other means of torture occurred as an established practice not just on an isolated basis
8703951 was not limited to the usual beatings but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and planned torture
8703952 particular command members were aware of the systematic abuse and perpetuated it either by actively participating in some or failing to take any action to bring it to an end
8703953 if i hadnt reviewed the cases myself i wouldnt believe it we have evidence from four men who did not know each other all getting beaten and tortured and convicted on the basis of the confessions they allegedly provided they are perfect examples of what is so terribly broken about our system
8703954 these werent death penalty cases so theyre not nearly as sexy
8703955 all along he knew he was going to ultimately prevail
8703956 but the family had to bail him out they cashed out 401 k s savings everything they did everything they could collectively
8703957 we have people at the highest levels of public office who have built their careers on torture
8703958 the state of illinois doesnt care about you if youre black and youre poor thats what these cases show
8703959 i think its an accumulation of racism and classism as well as a massive cover up that has led many people to not get fair hearings
8703960 their lawyers didnt believe them and didnt even request hearings
8703961 its just pretty outrageous because all of the physical evidence points to someone else
8703962 but they had gotten a confession out of him before they found the stolen car
8703963 ethically the attorney general is obligated to handle each case individually based on the facts and history of the case no two cases are the same
8703964 madigan needs to order evidentiary hearings so torture victims can present evidence of torture on the way to winning new trials regardless of the differences in individual cases every single torture victim deserves a new trial where confessions that were electroshocked beaten and suffocated out of them are not used against them
8703965 every day lisa madigan sits and does nothing is a day she is furthering a cover up
8703966 with gas prices the way it is i havent been able to get down there
8703967 after all of this happened we stayed together for a while and then we all separated
8703968 i think right after that well be ready to get going
8703969 i wouldnt think so just the way it has been but who knows
8703970 once youre in the batting practice arena youre getting very close
8703971 hes got good command of his off speed stuff hes moved fairly quickly through our system and people have been real high on him
8703972 i hoped i could kill them quickly no one believes me or likes me anymore i have no friends no work colleagues

8703978 when people are worried that theyre going to run out of food when they have to make nutritional compromises we have a state of food insecurity we have a real public health problem
8703979 for many of us kraft dinner is a comfort food but what we heard very clearly from low income canadians is that kraft dinner is not comforting when you cannot always afford basics like milk and butter

8703985 w e still dont have a birth certificate for obama there are claims that he was actually born in kenya
8703986 if its so important an issue that the campaign if they had a real birth certificate from hawaii the campaign would put it out not rely on a phony thing photoshopped by daily kos
8703987 and as wes pruden in todays edition of the washington times hes the editor emeritus puts it you know this is a story that could have long legs
8703988 summer long controversy continues about when and where the senator was actually born and whether the circumstances of his birth could cloud his eligibility to serve

8704000 no hay que darle tanto cr dito a las encuestas
8704001 si tomamos en cuenta el grado de desaprobaci n de bush el alto desempleo la guerra en irak la crisis hipotecaria por la que miles de familias han perdido sus casas y el precio de la gasolina entonces lo normal ser a que obama estuviera liderando la intenci n de voto por muchos puntos
8704002 no nos deber a extra ar lo cerrado de la competencia as fue en otros a os por ejemplo en 2000 la elecci n se decidi por un estado florida est claro que hay una gran polarizaci n en este pa s pero cuando nos centremos en los temas que realmente importan a los estadounidenses como la econom a obama gana
8704003 uno de los obst culos que ha enfrentado obama es su mensaje de cambio que fue tan popular en las primarias ahora que la gente lo ve como candidato presidencial se sienten inseguros
8704004 se niega a utilizar un bot n con la bandera en su saco y por eso nunca podr a votar por ese se or
8704005 dicen que en su avi n no tiene una bandera y la tiene exactamente en el mismo lugar que lo tiene el avi n de mccain dicen que es musulm n cuando es cristiano dicen tantas cosas que son mentira que es muy frustrante
8704006 obama est entra la espada y la pared por un lado la gente le eligi por el cambio pero si quiere ganar el partido necesita utilizar estrategias m s tradicionales tiene que salir y atacar al contrincante
8704007 has since undergone hospital surgical medical and para medical treatment
8704008 we make every effort to minimise risk for the girls
8704009 such a high percentage of polarisation means you really have to have very good conditions a magnetic field that is very ordered
8704010 but once you get away from the pulsar then you get a much more complex situation because the field begins to break up into little patches and knots
8704011 its so well studied that the easy questions have been answered now were down to the more complicated issues
8704012 obviously theres a sense of hurt and disappointment for what could have been
8704013 it just had to be that way that people who worked hard for hillary would have their due
8704014 a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of u s president
8704015 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8704016 i do not think there is unanimous appetite for it imposing sanctions on russia
8704017 that is a sick imagination and probably that applies to sanctions as well i think it is a demonstration of complete confusion
8704018 it that was the case then the recent events could have a american domestic political dimension
8704019 if that is true if that is confirmed then thats really bad its very dangerous and a mistaken policy
8704020 to rely exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and prevents finding a comprehensive resolution of local conflicts
8704021 the sco states express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the south ossetian issue and urge the sides to solve existing problems peacefully through dialogue and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks
8704022 it ends up being a magnet from a distance it looks real
8704023 he said he had just purchased the car he said his friend gave it to him
8704024 usually when theres something wrong with the car in the first place
8704025 as he exits i see in plain view in the drivers door sticking out of the counsel there was a clear sandwich baggie inside it had smaller baggies which resembled the way heroin is packed wrapped really thin in wax paper
8704026 you cant really look at the big picture like that you have to work on each case one at a time hopefully you can slow it down a little bit
8704027 leads to more crime it brings people into a neighborhood who usually wouldnt be there
8704028 we have to leave this town i cant stand another day without the rain
8704029 well leave now you can pack our things let me get the bill i can make it straight it was the same as yesterday
8704030 i think we just delivered the south to the republican party for a long time to come
8704031 the civil rights and voting rights acts were the bridge that brought minorities over into the opportunity to advance in education in politics in society
8704032 lyndon johnsons experience of being born in the south made him aware and sensitive to the history of discrimination the civil rights act and the war on poverty are why i am where i am today
8704033 many of us are going to be voting for a black man for president this time that wouldnt be happening yet if he johnson hadnt prepared the way for it
8704034 she told me for black people johnson will be the greatest president there ever was
8704035 johnson was the last president to be successful with a major domestic agenda
8704036 to encompass all americans democrats republicans independents light dark and beige

8704046 it was a conscious decision to get in the car and it was a conscious decision on the part of the bartender not to stop her and continue to her give her friend alcohol
8704047 as far as i know no jury in dauphin county has assessed punitive damages against a drunk driver a bar and a bartender
8704048 so i was curious to see what that number would be and it was a million dollars

8704053 as the third anniversary of katrina and the seventh anniversary of 911 coincide with the beginning of national readiness month it is interesting to consider who tends to be the least prepared for crises
8704054 a police buggy came down with a big sign that said

8704057 back in my early days everything consisted of what i like to call tuxedo magicians where everyone wore a tuxedo and a nice button up shirt with a vest everybody looked the same
8704058 so when criss angel came out it showed everybody that not all magicians are the same there are different styles different qualities to magicians
8704059 dealing with a deck of cards and looking at peoples faces when i could find their card blindfolded made me enjoy what i do
8704060 i have an illusion right now that im setting up that involves the band journey and their song faithfully its a whole romance piece
8704061 if everything goes according to plan i hope to release it to the public in the next year or so
8704062 im always interested in what other magicians are doing im always seeing whos raising the bar and seeing if there are ways i can create my own bar
8704063 i tried leaving magic for about a year or so when i was 16
8704064 theres a rule that once you do magic youll never leave it its stuck with you forever ill do it until the day i die

8704076 sometimes a book is a disposable adventure an entertaining temporary distraction that you dont think about again once youve read the last page but sometimes a book means so much more at penguin we believe that the books we cherish and read over and over those that we feel a deep emotional connection with say omething defining about us and the type of people we are what are you reading what did you last read whos your favourite author are all standard first date questions and what better way to find your life partner than over a shared love for lawrence or a passion for pynchon we knew there was an opportunity for this type of service for our audience and the penguin community provides the perfect forum to meet a likeminded special someone

8704099 we have to protect the beauty of florida but we also need to have people have the opportunity to drive here and be able to afford to do that too
8704100 we hear that theres new technology we hear there are new processes we hear everything is a lot safer and rather than kind of rush to judgment based on past fears we want to take a close look
8704101 these are people who have been opposed to offshore drilling because they realize how important a clean environment is to our economy
8704102 but at the same time it doesnt help the tourism industry or the state economy to have gasoline prices in excess of 3 50 or 4 per gallon
8704103 weve always made the link that without our products tourism cant exist and operate in a proactive positive way in the state of florida and now i think they understand that in a much more obvious way than ever before
8704104 we are adamantly opposed to it now and in the future
8704105 i just dont see that theres a reward theres no balance between risk and rewards tourism is the no 1 driver of our economy not oil and we just cant take that risk
8704106 the false suggestion of a childhood event can lead to persistent false beliefs that have lasting behavioural consequences studies on false memories and beliefs have compellingly shown that misleading information can lead to the creation of recollections of entire events that have not occurred
8704107 until now however no one has examined the possible effects of false memories on behaviour we asked ourselves can false beliefs be sufficiently strong to alter behaviour if one develops false memories in the laboratory might they have an influence on ones short and long term attitudes and actions
8704108 interestingly these participants showed a distinct change in attitudes and behaviour towards this food even some time afterwards
8704109 they not only rated egg lower than other foods but they avoided egg salad sandwiches altogether
8704110 with obesity levels reaching epidemic proportions around the world we could use this type of suggestive therapy for treating cases of obesity or influencing dieting choices it may be possible for people to learn to avoid certain foods by believing they had negative experiences with the food as a child
8704111 our study is the first ever to show that false memories can be so persuasive that people change their behaviour both in the short and longer term we have clearly demonstrated that false suggestions about childhood events can profoundly change peoples attitudes and behaviour in adulthood
8704112 there are two schools of thought on co morbidity of depression and parkinsons
8704113 one is that the onset of depression precedes and possibly leads to parkinsons the other is that parkinsons disease predisposes for depression clinically theres evidence for both of those lines of thinking
8704114 were going to have some groups that undergo depression first then the parkinsons and then well do the reverse
8704115 then there will be some that are combined depression then parkinsonism then further depression
8704116 so stress induced depression exacerbates problems with movement and also causes the relevant brain cells to die faster
8704117 well we do but there are no really definitive epidemiological studies or long term assessments of the effects of antidepressants on the progression of parkinsons
8704118 not only could they reduce depression but they might actually protect dopamine cells in the brain and thus slow the progression of parkinsons
8704119 were gratified that an investment in our research by the local community and the davis phinney foundation has now led to a five year nih grant that will allow us to investigate how stress causes enhanced parkinsonian symptoms and how to prevent stress from causing further damage to the parkinsonian brain
8704120 it is not just that the american side could not restrain the georgian leadership from this the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8704121 why seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process it is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side and the job is done
8704122 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a for one of the candidates fighting for the post of u s president

8704124 io non so esattamente cosa giusto per me sono pi brava a vedere cosa giusto per gli altri come quando sei in autostrada e nella direzione opposta c una coda infinita a causa di un incidente mi capitato laltro giorno andavo tranquilla e osservavo quando sono arrivata alla fine della coda vedevo le macchine che si avvicinavano e avrei voluto avvisarle vedevo queste persone andare verso un destino che io conoscevo io sapevo dove si stavano infilando ma loro inconsapevoli guidavano con serenit per io non riesco a capire cosa succede nella mia corsia come si fa a capire qual il proprio destino
8704125 tu fai vedere al tuo sogno che veramente ci tieni a incontrarlo senza pretendere che lui faccia tutta la strada da solo per arrivare fino a te poi le cose accadono i sogni hanno bisogno di sapere che siamo coraggiosi

8704135 mrs skinner asked me four or five times over a three month period to kill him

8704137 she was my wife and i loved her i was taking care of her
8704138 i was feeding her buying her cigarettes and giving her money after that and paying my bills i had no money left
8704139 i had never been down so low in my life before
8704140 i thought once he was removed things might get better because she said she would come into money

8704296 non operiamo in nessun modo che possa contrastare gli interessi israeliani abbiamo declinato molte richieste che implicavano vendite di armi alla georgia e quelle che sono state approvate sono state analizzate scrupolosamente finora non abbiamo posto limitazioni alla vendita di misure protettive

8704299 though i love the arts with all my heart paintings sculpture theatre and music and think they are among the biggest achievements we humans can do i am really convinced that architecture is among the most important
8704300 this room is part of ourselves in this moment i think it is important to build for people and to deliver this message of hope through good construction and a certain sense of progression a better understanding of each other can be achieved all those things in modesty are what i have tried to convey
8704301 what has finally been important to us is not so much the idea of the building as the idea of the persons watching the building and also those inside living in harmony with the natural world
8704302 the world does not accept me society does not accept me this neighbor looks at me one way that one looks at me in another way

8704307 we havent had a banner year but its not as bad as everyone expected
8704308 but these guys are going to adjust by coming earlier or going home later it could potentially be a boon because of instead of going home on sunday they go on monday or at weird hours it could be a positive
8704309 nous nous sommes efforc s de ne pas c der la provocation lorsquils sont arriv s et nous essaierons de poursuivre cette politique lorsquils partiront
8704310 personne ne sattend une avanc e notable entre les deux mouvements palestiniens
8704311 nobodys come up with a way to prevent this from happening even here in the u s
8704312 the u s is probably more internet dependent than any place in the world so to that extent were more vulnerable than any place in the world to this kind of attack
8704313 so much of what were doing in the united states is out there on the internet and all of that can be taken down at once
8704314 this is such a crucial issue at every level our security now is dependent on computers
8704315 its a whole new era political and military conflicts now will almost always have a cyber component the chief targets will be critical infrastructure and the attacks will emerge from within our own computer systems
8704316 it only takes a couple of experts it doesnt take a whole cyber infantry division to pull something like this off
8704317 for a very small investment in resources you can have a huge impact
8704318 when it comes to our government it security were pretty strong in protecting against attacks
8704319 we can command so much bandwidth that its hard to overwhelm our servers
8704320 we are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks but right now most of the people who want to do us harm dont have those capabilities
8704321 youd see some disruption of essential services like electricity youd definitely see espionage
8704322 would it be decisive no nobodys going to win a conflict with the united states in cyberspace but would it be disruptive and irritating yes
8704323 that speech was amazing but its not going to change my mind
8704324 i talk to plenty of people like me who just wont accept an unqualified president
8704325 we dont need old people the military women italians white people debtors bloggers drivers gun owners trade or faith
8704326 its a huge issue its at least as big an issue as the dns issue if not bigger
8704327 i went around screaming my head about this about ten or twelve years ago we described this to intelligence agencies and to the national security council in detail
8704328 theres no vulnerabilities no protocol errors there are no software problems the problem arises from the level of interconnectivity thats needed to maintain this mess to keep it all working
8704329 everyone has assumed until now that you have to break something for a hijack to be useful
8704330 but what we showed here is that you dont have to break anything and if nothing breaks who notices
8704331 the rate of bgp path updates goes up by a factor of 200 to 400
8704332 they simply dont because it takes work and to do sufficient filtering to prevent these kinds of attacks on a global scale is cost prohibitive
8704333 that means that nobody could put themselves into the chain into the path unless they had been authorized to do so by the preceding as router in the path
8704334 we havent seen the attacks and so a lot of times people dont start working on things and trying to fix them until they get attacked
8704335 but the youtube case is the perfect example of an attack where somebody could have done much worse than what they did
8704336 going to church doesnt make you into a christian any more than going to mcdonalds makes you into a hamburger
8704337 the concept of god is an old superstition that is no longer needed to explain things in these modern times
8704338 do you agree with gods word that praying to mary and having statues of her and dead saints in your buildings is breaking the second commandment of idolatery
8704339 no because from my understanding of vatican ii mary is to be venerated but not worshipped
8704340 ahhhhh scappino cavalli dame cocchieri e cavallieri siamo nel duemila ohhh povera channy il poeta che ama ora legge la pagina economica ohhh anima persa ho forse letto troppo il galateo

8704342 esta campanha tem sido uma grande oportunidade de mostrar o muito que foi feito por campina ao longo dos ltimos tr s anos e meio quando veneziano buscou resgatar a auto estima de um povo que foi v tima de governos opressores e voltados apenas para mesquinhos interesses grupais

8704351 well if youre coming on friday anyway why not just celebrate then what does this have to do with me
8704352 no but ill get my little sister cheri to figure something out
8704353 theres the resort on the lake but it mostly rents cabins theres the bed and breakfast though
8704354 but theyre probably all booked this time of year if you want to stay over youre welcome to my couch
8704355 i might take you up on that if it gets late thanks ill have mari call you for directions later let me know if i need to do anything else ill call that bakery there and order a cake
8704356 buy her the biggest bunch of white daisies you can afford
8704357 it looks like the kind of thing margot would love so i cant imagine it is too out of fashion
8704358 well probably i didnt realize how worn our clothing was until i had to wear it in public so much we always had a good town outfit but we tended to wear our other clothes until they werent repairable or we hated looking at them anymore
8704359 it was your mothers suggestion actually shed heard of the plans while doing some sort of research at the library and knew i was looking for local ventures to invest in so she brought it to my attention
8704360 she wasnt willing to risk any part of your future she wanted it as secure as we could make it
8704361 well we can start having quarterly meetings if you like you could make small adjustments and see what you are comfortable with and besides itd give you an excuse to come to rockland and see more of the city i bought tickets to the fall winter session of the symphony i hoped youd come at least once or twice
8704362 symphony really id love it what if its on a day when i cant come you shouldnt have spent the money yet
8704363 ill give them to mari she and her husband always use my unused tickets
8704364 youre a good employer ive never heard of such thoughtfulness and ive read a lot of books
8704365 chad brought something and tied it to the back of his truck he dragged it up and down that thing for an hour the other day but i have to agree it does feel better a smile lit her face as willow grabbed bills hand and led him around behind the barn to the old swing
8704366 dont do that without warning me i thought i pushed you out at first
8704367 are you truly nervous out here like this or is it just an excuse to hold my hand
8704368 both well nervous is putting it lightly im positively terrified if you want the truth id rather face the subway carrying a wad of cash in plain sight however i do confess to taking advantage of my own fears in order to have a valid excuse to stay close
8704369 i have no idea what time it is but whatever time it is its late
8704370 oh he give me a key earlier for you ben franklin your parents had a sense of humor didnt they
8704371 air mattress on my bed if youd prefer sheets next to it ill be in at two
8704372 the probability that we may fail in the struggle ought not to deter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just
8704373 do we remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt
8704374 nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a mans character give him power
8704375 none of us are particularly fond of the name it was a long time ago just a random thing i think walt martin organ bass came up with it but it might have been hamilton leithauser vocals guitar and we just had a long list of bad names and we just sort of crossed them off you know then we had our first show and we just had to have a name so we picked one
8704376 we used to be playing in the back of our folks house when we were youngsters you know doing a little psychedelia and writing songs
8704377 pablo manazarek brought over his dads ray manzarek of the doors keyboards all these really cool synthesizers and stuff and we started experimenting with writing with electronics with triggers and electronic drums my younger brother has a really unique drum set with about 19 triggers on it so he can play electronic drums with his live drums anyway he was in his dentists office and he read an article on artificial intelligence and it clicked like hey this would be a cool name for a band it just stuck with us
8704378 we came up with it way before that movie came out
8704379 it is the name of a girl who mike gross guitar and dallon weekes lead vocals went to high school with
8704380 she always got called to the office but nobody knew her the name is an ode to the unpopular so to speak
8704381 s lutamos bem por causas que n s pr prios modelamos e com as quais nos queimamos ao identificarmo nos com elas
8704382 well i can just watch it on youtube its important to just be here

8704386 being a survivor means learning how to live with your past in my case thank god for therapy
8704387 its a crime and religion should get out of crime solving
8704388 protect them from a person who had discarded all erroneous beliefs and doctrines of the jehovahs witness cult put his full and complete trust in the lord jesus christ who as the great healer had cleaned up his life and forgiven him of sins that were indeed grievous
8704389 daniel is no longer the person that he was as a member of jehovahs witnesses his life is far different from what he once was
8704390 during our marriage daniel was never unfaithful to me and we always went out together to whatever christian activity he was engaged in and other activities as well
8704391 even on his way to work and back we kept in contact by radio citizen band all the way
8704392 he consumed no alcohol or go to drinkfests with his workmates he was a very loving and kind husband to me
8704393 i let myself be influenced by his first wife and the children
8704394 dad i am no longer a virgin as i had sex with a black man
8704395 marina i am no longer the person you once knew and my life has been drastically changed i love you very much as my daughter with fatherly love i am totally against your being a lesbian and god as you should know condemns those who engage in this practice unless you turn away from it and refrain from living this way
8704396 homosexuality by definition is not healthy or wholesome at worst the homosexual person will die younger and suffer emotional mental and physical illness more often than the normal person the natural history of the homosexual person seems to be one of frigidity impotence broken personal relationships psychosomatic disorders alcoholism paranoia and suicide
8704397 praise god for he has delivered me from darkness of sin into truth love and to this glorious light and salvation in christ jesus
8704398 the weakened physical emotional and spiritual condition of the sex glutton usually makes him incapable of resisting the accompanying pressures and he eventually cracks under the weight he often ends by becoming a psychoneurotic or a suicide
8704399 a very violent statement they could have done themselves in in their own apartment obviously they were trying to say something
8704400 we are happy martyrs of the sex god we lived for
8704401 he knows very well that if he sues me more people will want the book and buy it

8704416 how about we have coffee together in the coffeepot after ive been to the bank i need a shoulder to cry on got a spare hanky
8704417 id love to have coffee with you tony with or without the tears i dont have to hurry home roger is busy with something or other
8704418 splendid you go along and ill be with you shortly
8704419 sit up in the garden if its warm enough for you its more private
8704420 phoenix airport allows special clothing for somali muslim janitorial workers
8704421 i will instill terror into the hearts of the unbelievers smite ye above the necks behead and smite all their fingertips off them
8704422 take neither the jews nor the christians for your friends
8704423 to see the nipples of the former governor charlies father was an unsettling experience on which i did my best not to dwell
8704424 and it wasnt that you couldnt be friends with a married woman but you werent friends in the same way she didnt have the same freedom in her schedule especially not after she had children and even before that she didnt need you you needed friendship and friendship to her was auxiliary extra
8704425 as a single woman in my early thirties i was careful not to coo excessively over other peoples infants lest it seem like i was telegraphing my desperation the necessity of this precaution annoyed me making me want to defiantly announce
8704426 i felt a slight embarrassment to be drawing such attention to myself what was the reason to declare this so publicly but the reason was convention and there are worse rationales it was necessary i recognized for everyone else
8704427 i recognized her life i knew it so well i wanted to clasp her freckled hand to say to her its good on the other side but its good on your side too enjoy it there the loneliness is harder and the loneliness is the biggest part but some things are easier
8704428 above all i wanted my daughter to understand that many people were guided by bitterness and that it was best to avoid these individuals their moods and behavior were a hornets nest you had no possible reason to do anything other than bypass and ignore
8704429 hate was such a melodramatic emotion so blustery and silly
8704430 in general the reason i tried to be diplomatic was that you might occasionally regret your diplomacy but youd more frequently regret having been snippy
8704431 often during his first presidential campaign hed say on the trail when trying to contrast himself with the outgoing president who was widely viewed as a slick panderer
8704432 i can say sincerely that the single most astonishing fact of political life to me has been the gullibility of the american people even in our cynical age the percent of the population who is told something and therefore believes it to be true is staggering
8704433 i am curious of this at what point in their opinion should i have done something and what should that something have been should i not have married him should i not have discouraged his drinking when he told me that he wanted to run for governor and i told him id prefer he didnt when he decided that in spite of my stated preference he was going to run should i have left him should i have stayed with him but not campaigned for him should i have stated explicitly to the public when my views differed from his should i have left him when he decided also against my wishes to run for president anyone who has been married and especially anyone married for several decades knows the union is a series of compromises to judge the compromises i have made is i take it easy to do from far away
8704434 what i mean to say is that a part of me understands charlies behavior i understand it because i love him because i am predisposed to sympathize but i also think that unlike many in government or the media i dont ascribe to people loftier motives just because theyre in a loftier place
8704435 i have felt so strongly since charlie entered public office that my foremost duty is to take care of him to be the one person he sees on a daily basis whos not paid to agree or disagree with him who really is just a friend
8704436 what hes ruff done is encourage religious intolerance going so far as to put a spotlight on the hate filled e mails and phone calls hes received yet he claims that he is not a bigot or a racist hes not one of them he just wants their votes
8704437 a high percentage of muslims who attend that mosque are like all of us good americans hardworking honest kind the kind we all want to associate with but i think the majority is intimidated by a minority and i think theyre put in place to take control of these mosques and the reason for that is they want to institute in this country sharia law
8704438 once had a muslim neighbor who contributed to his political campaign apparently any muslim who contributes to ruffs war chest is a good muslim
8704439 rehab said the e mail was racist and never should have been shared with others
8704440 you should listen to and obey your ruler even if he was an ethiopian black slave whose head looks like a raisin
8704441 this election is a chance for america to tell the merchants of fear and division you dont decide who loves this country you dont decide who is a patriot you dont decide whose service counts and whose doesnt

8704454 the u s is one big giant discount shopping mall
8704455 they always want to see the grand canyon and the vegas strip the american sites
8704456 then we leave them for the evening and the next morning they tell us about all the shopping they did after we went to bed
8704457 the only way to get the message out about portland there is through mass media no one could afford a marketing campaign on that scale
8704458 this may give us only 20 minutes of tv exposure but you hope its building a relationship
8704459 we are ready for a fight to control the scientific high ground
8704460 great white fear of the dark phallus big black barack
8704461 great white fear of the dark phallus big black barack
8704462 she would breathe react and smile i would caress her and she recognized it she would sense my presence and my absence
8704463 it wasnt difficult to take care of her it was a true joy god gave me a more than special child i never suffered for even a minute
8704464 a child with anencephaly when he breathes is not in a state of brain death despite the high mortality rate some children can survive for months or even years
8704465 no in depth studies exist on the part of the brain that is not compromised by anencephaly many things exist that are unexplained for that reason is it necessary to be prudent
8704466 who is interested in a multitude of children without parents without love and without anyone
8704467 if i am president advancing the cause of life will not be above my pay grade
8704468 the mark of christianity is the paradox the absolute paradox
8704469 if subjectivity is truth and subjectivity is the existing subjectivity then if i may put it this way christianity is a perfect fit subjectivity culminates in passion christianity is paradox paradox and passion fit each other perfectly and paradox perfectly fits a person situated in the extremity of existence
8704470 we have had a president for nearly 8 years who has committed almost nothing but gaffes every day
8704471 prior restraint prior punishment and political dissent a moral and legal evaluation
8704472 the question of the extent to which we can legitimately demand that the liberal state tolerate internal political activism
8704473 we can write words numbering in the hundreds of thousands defining these rights and establishing rules for their maintenance however their continuance will always ultimately rest upon the restraint and respect of political activists and government authorities alike
8704474 erects a superstructure of innuendo guilt by often nonexistent association baseless speculation and sinister sounding but irrelevant digression the result is an example of what used to be known in the glory days of ideologically driven totalitarianism as the big lie in this case a fabricated alternate universe barack obama who we are told or invited to infer is a corrupt enraged anti american drug dealing anti israel pseudo christian radical leftist black militant plagiarist and liar trained as a muslim and mentored by a menagerie of marxists communists crypto communists and terrorists
8704475 boy buggering in both islam and catholicism is okay with the pope
8704476 everyone is subject to the law even websites and blogs
8704477 we do not intend to curtail peoples freedom or right to express themselves
8704478 but when they publish things that are libellous slanderous or defamatory it is natural for skmm to act
8704479 the promise was made not only to malaysians but to the world that there will be no censorship of the internet in the country
8704480 google is planning to build a multibillion ringgit datacentre here if this is the way the commission behaves it is as good as telling google to please go away
8704481 nothing in this act shall be construed as permitting the censorship of the internet
8704482 the commission is not the final judge to decide what is good and what is bad for malaysians
8704483 malaysians who are online are mature enough to discern between what is good and what is bad
8704484 the commission and the government should acknowledge that the problem at hand is the failure of the mainstream media to fulfil its duties in reporting information adequately truthfully and fairly
8704485 under the multimedia super corridor msc bill of guarantees the government promised there would be no censorship of the internet i do not understand why the skmm is resorting to this
8704486 in fact it is foolish to think that online censorship works effectively there are still many other ways for surfers to access the portal
8704487 all he raja petra has to do is to change the website address if they want to block it again they would have to issue more letters he may have lost some viewers for a couple of days but it would be back to normal soon
8704488 it is one thing when you are saying something and its an opinion but something else when you are putting it across as fact when it isnt
8704489 skmm may have briefed the minister on the issue but not me
8704490 i am aware of the issue but it is not under my jurisdiction
8704491 de volgende uitdaging is nu te komen tot een interne markt voor internationaal smsen en grensoverschrijdende datadiensten
8704492 ik reken op het franse voorzitterschap en het europees parlement om de commissie te helpen dit probleem zeer spoedig op te lossen
8704493 show kids its cool to get your work done instead of goofing off and being a jerk
8704494 youre very welcome for the information please keep reading and let us know how your story turns out
8704495 to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity
8704496 we do worry that as this information gets collected it becomes a treasure trove you can imagine that in the worst possible case we know everything youre doing and the government tries to track you
8704497 theres always a person whos first and theres always a person whos last and we found him
8704498 we had actual data that showed a bizarre bias that existed in our system we changed it to correct that
8704499 weve got a major national crisis around journalism particularly investigative journalism
8704500 if you go to scotland the health indicators are miserable particularly the west of scotland and glasgow
8704501 the food on offer is indicative of scotlands problems the traditional scottish breakfast is a biological disaster it is not healthy and in fact its a lot worse than that
8704502 there is this understanding that it is good to fill up and that it gives you the energy for the rest of the day
8704503 but have that standard breakfast and the only thing you want to do is sleep you couldnt possibly utilise all the calories
8704504 if you eat this and foods like it every day for 10 years the damage to the body is devastating you can cope with it when you are young but after 40 thats when the damage becomes apparent
8704505 scotland has a very poor health record and is similar to poland which has a history of a high fatty diet from the communist days when meat butter and high fat milk were subsidised
8704506 we have to move away from that to a more mediterranean diet but this is a huge national challenge and we must find a way to communicate with the masses
8704507 the sad facts are that people are having heart problems and risk shortening their lives because of poor diet when really they should be able to change and save themselves
8704508 a nation cannot be happy without good health so it is the priority for scotland
8704509 a lot is being done in scotland to fight this and im happy to be helping
8704510 the leading nations that produce tea are in asia yet you do not have a luxury tea brand from the region
8704511 twg tea is this asian brand for asia and the world
8704512 we felt that it was time for tea to evolve with the times to become not only a drink that is enjoyed by our grandfathers but a fashionable chic upmarket beverage for the young too
8704513 we also want twg tea to be a school of tea for the world a one stop shop where you can know everything there is to know about tea
8704514 a kilo of yellow tea retails for between 800 to 3 000
8704515 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8704516 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8704517 what does joe biden say about barack obama find out today
8704518 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8704519 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8704520 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8704521 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8704522 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8704523 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8704524 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8704525 what an amazing advance in technology that could save so much of our earths precious resources not to mention help with quality air control while pushing for a higher standard for other manufacturers
8704526 os fatos nos mostram que a apple est cometendo diversos erros
8704527 s o raras as companhias que conseguem fortalecer sua imagem dessa forma
8704528 o fato que mudou completamente o relacionamento da apple com seus usu rios foi a estr ia do ipod
8704529 a apple deixou de ser uma marca de produtos de relativo luxo e direcionada a um p blico segmentado para participar do mainstream da ind stria de eletr nicos e ser desejada fielmente por uma multid o de consumidores
8704530 loopholes in the system put licenses in the hands of those ill equipped to drive there is also a general apathy among consumers towards seat belts air bags and even motorcycle helmets
8704531 safety is unfortunately not a big part of the purchase decision of indian consumers our best selling small cars are typically not the safest vehicles on the road because consumers are more worried about fuel efficiency and the cost of ownership and would rather not pay for safety features such as air bags and anti lock brakes
8704532 we do believe the need for training is becoming increasingly relevant due to the increase in vehicle volumes high speed roads enhanced performance of vehicles and the requirement of specific skills for application on vehicles
8704533 the clown takes our deepest human weaknesses and makes them funny the clown is also an anarchist the clown gets to break the rules
8704534 in essence the clown is a character who helps us keep in touch with the sacred part of ourselves
8704535 its a difficult part to play at the core of the character is longing and the wish to find meaning in life

8704538 i think this is a wonderful thing for pittsburgh to be recognized officially as the launch of the exhibition
8704539 people in pittsburgh are understanding that now and before very few people thought about it the name of pittsburgh as the original gateway to the west it really is true
8704540 im sorry unless roger ailes calls me personally im doing the show

8704546 i spent three days without food or water and a day without oxygen above 20 000 feet
8704547 we expect the water to be up to 67 degrees this week at that level hypothermia is still a major concern
8704548 the reason its difficult is because of the bodys physiology
8704549 anybody that is able to climb mount everest or do anything that is highly physically demanding over a long period of time it takes incredible cardiovascular fitness
8704550 and i would say the same about swimming the english channel
8704551 its going to be a great challenge and that is what really appeals to me
8704552 these are things where you have to be at your absolute peak of physical conditioning mentally as strong as youve ever been and have some luck

8704599 volevo descrivere il mio conflitto come regista e personaggio televisivo e stavolta volevo farlo tramite larte dice il simpatico kitano in conferenza stampa a venezia dove il suo film viene presentato nel concorso ufficiale metto in scena il lavoro dellartista e quello che lui esprime ho trattato il lato oscuro dellarte volevamo descrivere una storia davvero crudele larte vista come una droga
8704600 i dipinti che ho utilizzato nel film sono opere mie non sono per niente belli ma stato meglio inserire questi piuttosto di utilizzare i quadri di van gogh e picasso stato un bene per il budget del film i miei quadri non costano nulla
8704601 di solito non li vendo risponde quello che succede che organizzo una lotteria tra i compratori chi vince se lo porta via gratis
8704602 ho scelto un pittore come protagonista volevo imitare la sensibilit di van gogh i miei film sono sempre molto seri per questo stato ritenuto pi serio soprattutto dal pubblico che lo ha visto meno ironico di altri anche se io penso di aver sempre fatto dei giochi di umorismo come negli altri film ma gli spettatori che lo hanno visto in giappone si sono commossi nel vederlo
8704603 a venezia vengo ogni anno ormai conclude kitano come se fosse diventato un ciclo di produzione dentro di me ho vinto due premi su quattro film presentati non sono lunico giapponese che partecipa ci sono cos tanti film che si candidano alla mostra ma non vengono accettati devo dire che molto difficile essere accolti nel concorso ma non pensate che pago i giurati sottobanco

8704606 we want to open up the convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party
8704607 the question for obama is what have you done and what have you run
8704608 he has good oratory but when you shut off the teleprompter theres not much there
8704609 we developed the portacast system in response to many requests for compact production gear that could be easily transported to remote locations throughout its development we worked very closely with many field savvy broadcast engineers to select components that offered the highest functionality and production values the result is a truly revolutionary system that will prove to be a powerful tool for producing news sports reality tv live events and documentaries
8704610 we were looking for a compact system for remote news gathering and the portacast system fulfilled our requirements lightweight iata compliant modular ultra portable and affordable

8704616 they told us on radio and tv we should take documents and personal belongings and leave our houses to wait near bus stops

8704626 since 2004 the number of kentucky public high school students taking ap examinations and scoring 3 4 or 5 has increased by more than 50 percent
8704627 sen mccain has always been sensitive to national crisis in the 2000 race he postponed his announcement to run for the presidency because of the situation in the balkans and we are monitoring the situation very closely
8704628 it is now clear that we will require further fundamental changes in our operating cost base in order to minimise losses in 2009 and to help ensure the long term viability of the business
8704629 we are looking at the current shift towards fuel efficient cars in the u s as a structural change in demand
8704630 we intend to respond quickly and flexibly to this environment
8704631 ze stond bijna op instorten madonna is ontzettend perfectionistisch en omdat een aantal bekenden aanwezig was werd het haar helemaal te veel
8704632 mensen uit het verleden hoef ik nu niet meer in mijn leven
8704633 ik wil zelfs niet dat ze ook maar de gelegenheid hebben om mij te benaderen
8704634 ik vertelde het hem vandaag nog je bent de liefde van mijn leven
8704635 ze barst gemiddeld drie keer per dag in tranen uit en is zo moe dat brad haar twee keer half bewusteloos in bad heeft gevonden ze is de hele tijd in de weer met de kinderen geeft de tweeling borstvoeding en doet er alles aan ze in slaap te krijgen maar zo gauw er n wakker wordt wordt de ander ook wakker ze eet heel weinig omdat ze er geen tijd voor heeft de dokter wil haar dan ook dwingen meer calorie n te eten dat is beter voor haar en haar melk
8704636 het gaat nu goed met haar maar haar leven beweegt zich in cirkels het is als een ritje in een achtbaan ze is iemand die hoogst gevoelig is en n klein dingetje kan haar uit balans brengen
8704637 toen ze 15 was is ze ingestort en moest ze terug naar haar huis in louisiana ze was erg onzeker en had het gevoel dat ze niet mooi was
8704638 er bestaat geen twijfel over dat ze gebaseerd op de afgelopen twee jaar een bijzonder instabiel iemand is
8704639 een goede moeder en een goede persoon is sterker nog ze is aardiger dan de meeste sterren die ik ontmoet heb maar zoals britney me zelf eens vertelde haar leven is altijd al twee stapjes voorwaarts n stap terug geweest

8704670 ik heb echt geprobeerd om het te laten werken omdat ik graag weer een vaderfiguur wilde hebben ik wilde dat dingen zouden veranderen ondanks dat er mensen waren die me vertelden dat sommige mensen gewoon niet veranderen
8704671 men had gelijk hij is nog niet veranderd en als dat nog gaat gebeuren dan zonder zijn dochter aan zijn zijde
8704672 waarom hij de behoefte heeft om commentaar te leveren op dingen die ik voor mezelf wil houden vind ik onbegrijpelijk als hij echt om me zou geven dan zou hij mijn wens om met rust gelaten te worden respecteren

8704684 people who wear crocs go on and on about how comfortable they are and how its supposedly odor resistant because its made out of some kind of anti bacterial foam you know what else its resistant to you getting laid
8704685 ive given fashion the finger and joined the dorcs revolution

8704695 if mccain s the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8704696 he who conceals his sin does not prosper but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy
8704697 therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed the prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective
8704698 many of those who believed now came and openly confessed their evil deeds a number who practiced sorcery brought their scrolls books on witchcraft together and burned them publicly when they calculated the value of the scrolls the total came to 50 000 each a days wage in this way the word of the lord spread widely and grew in power
8704699 for whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed exposed and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought into the open
8704700 for there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed exposed and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open
8704701 i might be speaking against something that god is actually doing
8704702 my assignment from the lord is to repent on behalf of the leadership of the charismatic body of christ

8704713 much ink has been spilled over the proper characterization and treatment of negative equity in secured claims subject to the hanging paragraph
8704714 a leading car lender general motors acceptance corporation has stated in defending a similar claim that between 26 and 38 of all its new car financing involves negative equity
8704715 g iving negative equity pmsi status effectively enriches car lenders at the expense of the debtors unsecured creditors

8704755 harvest is upon us again and the rcmp would like to remind all persons in the industry that safety of all must be a priority
8704756 children should not be allowed access to or near farm equipment their attention span and ability to recognize danger is not fully developed therefore having them around equipment is extremely hazardous
8704757 about the risk of staying on the same path were on the risk of just more of the same versus the change we need
8704758 this will be something that will be a little more nuts and bolts than what were accustomed to seeing from barack obama
8704759 hes going to definitely try to contrast his message and his programs with those of john mccain
8704760 were hearing his campaign is having second thoughts about doing this real big production because hes being dogged from his opponents that hes a rock star for those soaring speeches to packed houses
8704761 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8704762 this is the biggest moment since martin luther king in the civil rights movement for blacks in the united states so he cannot ignore kings speech
8704763 but at the same time i dont think he can overemphasize it because the key democratic group that he needs to win over are working class whites talking too much about the civil rights movement could alienate that crowd
8704764 what should have been a democratic cakewalk is not a democratic cakewalk
8704765 this convention was his chance to reintroduce himself to americans to portray himself as an all american man from an all american family somebody who will not betray the values of the voters that hes going for that hes not a lofty man with his head in the stars

8704767 in the last 30 days ive used 12gb not abusive for an unlimited account in my estimation
8704768 i mentioned i didnt see youtube as a streaming service the way the internet is now its almost impossible to avoid multimedia
8704769 these are not typical or normal users their activities are placing extreme demands on the network that are simply way beyond reasonable
8704770 as we contacted those customers we found that some were well aware that they were violating the terms of service and were not surprised to get a call from us just like the wired internet we know that some abusers employ a strategy of moving from carrier to carrier and abusing the services until they get caught
8704771 they also tend to be the most vocal on online blogs claiming that their rights have been violated
8704772 its a challenge thats been floating around in adventure circles for a while now
8704773 i spent three days without food or water and a day without oxygen above 20 000 feet
8704774 we expect the water to be up to 67 degrees this week at that level hypothermia is still a major concern
8704775 the reason its difficult is because of the bodys physiology
8704776 anybody that is able to climb mount everest or do anything that is highly physically demanding over a long period of time it takes incredible cardiovascular fitness
8704777 and i would say the same about swimming the english channel
8704778 its going to be a great challenge and that is what really appeals to me
8704779 these are things where you have to be at your absolute peak of physical conditioning mentally as strong as youve ever been and have some luck

8704781 atletico are a tough draw but weve got enough to get through
8704782 we have the know how and the knowledge to get through this group i cant see it being a problem
8704783 we know about psv and marseille and i cant see a problem there atletico yes thatll be difficult but we will go through
8704784 the important thing is making a good start we took one point from the first three games last season and weve got to do better
8704785 the perfect peanut butter cookie crisp on the outside and soft on the inside
8704786 the important phase for my assignment obviously is to get in touch with all the players on the ground so that i can absorb the realities on the ground and to organize quite quickly a few work sessions so as to directly engage the issues
8704787 we have to put mechanisms in place that will not only allow a sustained cease fire but will also help avoid reoccurrence of violent incidents
8704788 one can not consider lightly any event which has caused such a tragic loss obviously everyone has his own share of responsibility
8704789 we have to sit around the table and find solutions that make everyone secure
8704790 its a bunch of checks and theyre not for us
8704791 its not like i was out circling schools it was just a service i provided because people wanted it
8704792 i like to think of myself as a very passive person and its probably because i smoke a lot of herb
8704793 theres nowhere id rather be than with my family on stage

8704796 what three events in your life have made you the person you are today
8704797 and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were although at a glance acts 13 48 appears to teach that god chooses i e appoints people to be saved nothing could be further from the truth which is clearly evidenced if we compare this scripture with other scriptures for example consider the words of john 1 12 received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name
8704798 macarthur states that god must choose us before he gives us the power to believe but in sharp contrast john 1 12 teaches that god gives the power to be saved to those who receive him that power is the gospel romans 1 16 biblically it is who choose god and not god who chooses us macarthur is teaching doctrines of devils and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained
8704799 the same exact word is used in romans 13 1
8704800 in acts 13 48 teaches predestination to salvation goes 100 contrary to dozens of scriptures which teach that man has a
8704801 to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name
8704802 behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me
8704803 let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely
8704804 and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed
8704805 may be saved simply by trusting upon the lord jesus christ for the forgiveness of sins salvation is having our sins taken away by the precious blood of jesus christ 1st john 1 7
8704806 for therefore we both labor and suffer reproach because we trust in the living god who is the specially of those that believe
8704807 to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins whosoever
8704808 and if any man hear my words and believe not i judge him not for i came not to judge the world but to
8704809 for there is no respect of persons with god for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men
8704810 which has been paid for by jesus literal physical precious blood hebrews 9 12
8704811 let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely
8704812 theyve been leaving shit pellets under the sink and on the floor over there by the phone
8704813 well son we do but i cant shoot them in the cupboard
8704814 im serious ive got to get people to realize that the government is full of it republicans and democrats want to argue over stuff thats not important like gay marriage or the war in iraq or illegal immigration when i run if i run were going to talk about real issues like improving our schools cleaning up our neighborhoods of drugs and crime and making alabama a better place for all people
8704815 well i think they they want to be judge and jury like im for gay marriage its none of my business if gay people want to get married im pro choice and i think these christians first of all theyre supposed to be theyre not supposed to judge other people but theyre the most hypocritical judge of people we have in this country and it bugs the hell out of me they act like theyre christians and theyre not forgiving at all
8704816 we do not believe that the district courts action infringes on petitioners right to free speech

8704828 dark chocolate orange creme soda is not as good a combination as i would have expected
8704829 for this reason excitement in revivals pleading prayers and zealous activities are but a waste of time as we shall see only one kind of basic dealing can enable man to be useful before god brokenness
8704830 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away
8704831 then i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god prepared as a bride for her husband
8704832 i have betrothed you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ
8704833 and i heard a loud voice from heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself will be with them and be their god

8704856 i welcome the genuine reductions of violence that have taken place although i would point out that much of that violence has been reduced because there was an agreement with tribes in anbar province sunni tribes who started to see after the democrats were elected in 2006 you know what the americans may be leaving soon and we are going to be left very vulnerable to the shias we should start negotiating now thats how you change behavior
8704857 so i think it is fair to say that the president has simply tried to gain another six months to continue on the same course that hes been on for several years now it is a course that will not succeed
8704858 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse

8704910 strateghi che in nome del popolo sono pronti ad elaborare riforme funzionali soltanto agli interessi di una parte dimenticando che la nazione si fonda sul concetto di mutualit e di solidariet sul quale pu anche e solo trovare spazio unidea federalista dello stato che non stata mai estranea al cattolicesimo pre post risorgimentale e post fascista cos come la possibilit di una scuola con pi marcate connotazioni regionalistiche
8704911 ci che desta maggiore apprensione invece scrive donato lanomalo approccio di un ministro della repubblica con la scuola ditalia della quale forse in nome di una settaria ed errata interpretazione del federalismo cerca di dare in modo frettolosamente artefatto ma subdolo unimmagine parcellizzata e territorializzata tentando di sconvolgerne attraverso un uso capillarmente pianificato dei mass media il tradizionale e monolitico assetto di istituzione nazionale che coinvolge tutti i cittadini dal sud al nord rendendoli partecipi di un

8704918 previous studies have showed that the steep decline begins around five years before death
8704919 what we could see in our data is that these changes occur much earlier than thought
8704920 there is substantial acceleration in cognitive decline many years prior to death among individuals without dementia
8704921 a change in verbal ability might therefore be considered a critical marker for degeneration in health in older people

8704929 our study has shown that bmp signalling molecules released by cells bind to the type iv collagen extracellular matrix
8704930 we have also shown that human type iv collagen binds a human bmp signalling molecule suggesting that the regulation also exists in vertebrates
8704931 as alterations in the activity of bmp and type iv collagen molecules can lead to cancer and kidney diseases respectively our data will ultimately have important implications for human disease
8704932 the bmp signalling pathway initially acts as a tumour suppressor but when a tumour becomes malignant it uses the pathway to become aggressive and spread to other parts of the body
8704933 in addition part of the collagen we have identified as important has tumour suppressor activity so we believe that when the bmp pathway is being exploited by aggressive tumours the collagens are counteracting this this is another facet to be investigated
8704934 finally type iv collagen is also important in kidney development and disease
8704935 this study has given us a new area to manipulate making tumours more or less aggressive by controlling how active this pathway is in the future we could see compounds that are designed to make the regulation stronger to work against a tumour or reverse kidney disease

8704965 optically the ultravids are without doubt the best binoculars ive ever used clear sharp and with no fringing at all thanks to the use of lightweight materials like magnesium for the housing and titanium for the central hinge shaft i no longer feel like im carrying a boulder around my neck after a day in the field and the neck strap is as comfortable as expected ive used them on five continents already at high altitude in strong sunlight and at dusk in light rain and strong winds and they have performed exceptionally well every time they dont fog up they dont let in dust and as the manufacturers booklet suggests you can clean them by running them under a tap
8704966 because of its superb optical resolution and contrast the ultravid belongs in any list of the top binoculars of the world look through a leica ultravid and youre immediately struck with how bright and clear the image is from the center of the generous field of view to the outer edges and how true and free from bias are the colors
8704967 if you just hit the lottery and money is no object the best top of the line binoculars say the experts at field amp stream are the german leica ultravid 10 42mm hd at 2 095 the best mid priced binocs were leupolds mojave 10 42mm at 480 okay so the ultravids are the best but ill never throw away my 20 year old bushnell binoculars i paid a little over 100 for i love em seriously now despite what f amp s says were idiots if we buy the most expensive item when another performed just as well

8704969 the laws of quantum mechanics itself cannot be formulated without recourse to the concept of consciousness
8704970 no elementary quantum phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is a registered phenomenon in some strange sense this is a participatory universe
8704971 being in its physical analogue at least has been revealed in the wave function any sense we have of profound unity with the cosmos could be presumed to correlate with the action of the deterministic wave function
8704972 psychic phenomena such as distant viewing and out of body experiences are examples of the nonlocal operation of consciousness quantum mechanics undergirds such a theory by providing crucial support for the case of nonlocality of consciousness
8704973 the apparent absurdities of quantum physics make the apparent absurdities of parapsychology a little less preposterous and more digestible

8705001 theres still a racial edge people still see things in black and white its deeply ingrained the mindset is whites vote republican blacks democrat
8705002 if a black man stood for president you would just say no way no way
8705003 the generation that wouldnt contemplate a black president is passing on and thats good for everybody if its not now its just around the corner we will no longer be denied
8705004 its a feeling you cant put into words its like we are no longer a subculture finally its given us reason to think we are part of the overall scheme of things
8705005 any democratic candidate who gets a big turnout of black voters is off to a very good start its just getting that other 20 thats difficult
8705006 i honestly thought this would be different i mean were not in the 60s any more but it really became a big issue for me
8705007 i asked her was there a problem with the fact that he was black she told me i had to get out
8705008 you dont want a president with no connection to christianity
8705009 when you drive through white neighbourhoods i dont think youll see many obama signs or bumper stickers people who vote for him will do it quietly they dont know who he is what his religion is is he the antichrist
8705010 id like reassurance about who he is whos backing him just to be sure theres not an underlying current
8705011 that he does turn out to be a muslim after all
8705012 i dont have anything against a black man as president
8705013 but obama hes not qualified when you are president you represent everyone not just your race ive heard him talk about his people
8705014 and what about his religion he cant just drop his religion
8705015 well he should make it clear he stands by christian values in america that he doesnt hold those other values
8705016 i dont think hes done that at all hes just run from it he should have nipped it in the bud and made clear hes a president for everybody
8705017 just because hes a muslim he should make it clear he doesnt believe in suicide bombing and killing
8705018 theyre going to try and make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
8705019 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
8705020 roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
8705021 call me crazy but isnt it possible just possible that obamas lead is being inhibited by the fact that he is you know black
8705022 the northern system of segregation has never been about symbols of power on the streets separate water fountains but about segregated neighbourhoods and workplaces
8705023 states like ohio are so close that just a couple of percent of voters who decide not to vote for him on grounds of race could swing the result
8705024 not just because hes black though thats a very good start but because he has no experience
8705025 if blacks come in here we really dont have anything available for them
8705026 some people wonder what im doing here let alone a black president of the united states
8705027 a black president thats a tough sell obama could be all right now but come november people might say not yet
8705028 theres a lot of people who dont want a black man in the white house
8705029 it would say that we as a country have arrived theres a need for redemption there always will be an obama presidency will provide some of that redemption

8705052 del lived her life with great compassion wit tenacity generosity and valor

8705147 how do u make flash on blogspot i dnt get it
8705148 ive never seen the streets like this i cant believe this is denver
8705149 awesome post check out my site at blah blah blah blah blah
8705150 what we are trying to do is identify force generation needs we are looking at the way ahead
8705151 we already know where we are going to be in six months we are looking two years plus trying to figure out what we see the ia looking like what challenges we are going to encounter in getting to that end state
8705152 they know how to clear rooms they know how to conduct a cordon and search they do that all the time and they are doing that on their own like in recent operations in amarah they are conducting major combat operations like up in diyalah right now with minimal coalition support
8705153 our role is shifting as the iraqis get increasingly better at controlling their battlespace we are shifting less from advising on operations and intelligence and fires where they are not only competent but they are four or five times better than the bad guys and we are helping them more on logistics
8705154 they can actually fall in on our old outposts and have a fully functional outpost thats what
8705155 the end goal is for them to increase their security capability and for us to decrease our presence
8705156 were showing the people that we care about them and we care about the future
8705157 i hope that this will show iraqi contractors that here just like in america they shouldnt be scared of anything by helping us we are all just trying to help the children
8705158 one of the first patrols we went on was to go assess this pool
8705159 our contractor didnt want to drain the pool completely when kids are still using it so he was able to set it up so the kids could swim while construction was going on they were working 24 hours a day on the project
8705160 the perfect end state would be that the project becomes self sufficient it doesnt require any american influence to be able to continue
8705161 i dont lose anything if i cut a share from my profits and give it here for my country
8705162 we want the community to have the ability to experience a part of childhood that every kid should have
8705163 its very simple these are the people who are protecting our safety and guarding our freedom and anything we can do for them is just a very small token compared to what they do for us
8705164 certainly we can never repay the men and women in the armed forces for all their hard work and sacrifice we do all we can but you can never do enough
8705165 when i got back it was not only as if i had never left but they just showered me with attention and appreciation
8705166 you get a great perspective being in the military not only because you know whats important in life but you are constantly in touch with a culture that values integrity commitment duty and things like that
8705167 and the other thing is you are constantly dealing with all types of people in the military and that helps you deal with your clients as a civilian lawyer
8705168 weve had good experiences with those people they typically have very strong leadership skills are willing and able to accept responsibility and have a proven track record of performance in the military
8705169 anything we do is only a small gesture compared to what the men and women in the armed forces do

8705189 simply make the areas they dig in smell bad to the armadillo
8705190 armadillos have sensitive noses anything with a strong noxious odor can help evict an armadillo from a den mothballs have been used successfully in the past and some armadillos do not like the smell of pine needles or pine mulch placing mothballs around the areas you most want to protect can keep pesky burrowers away
8705191 despite my longstanding interest in armadillos i have never studied them professionally
8705192 my own research has focused on the circadian control of behavior in rodents
8705193 people should have access to health care but why should the rest of us pay for someone elses health care when they make bad decisions

8705203 ecco s questa sarebbe una gavetta adatta per mio figlio

8705241 we will feed the hungry and educate the needy and do what we can so the jobless can find work we will try to cut a path though the legal thicket and try to wipe foolish youngsters records clean and may it be that we will before long offer hope to torn families and housing to people who live under the bridge but above all we will not run we will not shrink from the darkness we will never surrender to it but we will stand strong and we will build a fire no matter how close the darkness comes no matter how deep it grows we will never sell out we will never deny what we know to be true we will build a fire because a fire burns in us a fire we did not set and we will huddle together in its light and in its warmth and we will not leave no matter how dark and cold it becomes
8705242 as steel and other industries in the lehigh valley died in the 20th century

8705244 because of the work we do to respect the dignity of every human being
8705245 some of our ministries are part of our corporation some work directly with us to support our primary ministries others have made a home here and have invited us to supervise their staff some simply use our space free of charge partnering with us in an informal way to be a sign of grace in the city
8705246 more than our outreach programs we are a community that asks the hard questions in life without expecting to find neat or final answers we seek to honor our childrens experiences of god and help them to dream a holy dream for the future we strive to accept people for who they are while inviting them to become all they can be all of our life our life together and our life of service emerges from the presence of christ we discover among us when we celebrate the eucharist our liturgy is the heart of our corporate life it is there that we see and touch and taste and hear gods outrageous promises and in response embrace gods outrageous demands
8705247 i give thanks for your ministry in so many areas that respond to the basic needs of human beings and for your ability to speak good news to the bad news the world serves up may you continue to be a rich and grace filled blessing to those around you

8705253 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8705254 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8705255 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8705256 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8705285 al lami was a moderate official and we are surprised by his arrest
8705286 the man has been known to travel in and out of iraq to neighboring nations including iran and lebanon where it is believed he meets and helps run the iranian backed special groups in iraq

8705291 in fact 28 000 hectares of yukpa lands were given in concession to corpozulia the zulia state development corporation with a view to mining for phosphate
8705292 the core of our proposal is that the government should permanently cancel the mining concessions or that parliament should revoke them we want the indigenous territories to be demarcated with the participation of the indigenous communities and their allies and we want plots of land owned by non indigenous people to be bought by the government as necessary so that they can live in peace
8705293 no one should have any doubt between the landowners and the yukpa the revolutionary government is with the indigenous people
8705294 and if necessary we will compensate the infrastructure improvements made by the ranchers
8705295 we are not invading the ranchers lands but recovering land that used to belong to our grandparents we came down to farm on the plains so that our children do not die in the mountains
8705296 they cannot use weapons of war against us the armys duty is to protect us because we only want our land so we can live in peace
8705297 did so because the caciques our chiefs have been threatened with death if they step outside of their communities by the thugs hired by the ranchers everyone in the sierra de perij knows that
8705298 the strategist behind this whole policy aimed at favouring the long term interests of transnational mining companies general carlos mart nez the head of corpozulia

8705311 it is now clear what the foreseeable danger with this product is
8705312 the fact that we have put out this warning pretty much has determined that this is a product that should not be used by consumers

8705401 some of the practices that these folks hammered may provide alternative forms of understanding how to do low level sustainable development today
8705402 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns
8705403 if you find it in europe its a city if you find it somewhere else it has to be something else
8705404 they have quite remarkable planning and self organization more so than many classical examples of what people would call urbanism
8705405 this throws a wrench in all the models suggesting we are looking at primordial biodiversity
8705406 proving that we can directly measure amyloid beta in the human brain is an important step forward for both clinical and basic research and that may be true not just in alzheimers disease but also in other serious neurological disorders
8705407 we cant at this point rule out a very early spike in amyloid right after a brain injury
8705408 the results have potentially important clinical implications because the measurement of amyloid beta in the human brain may turn out to be a good indicator of how well brain cells are communicating with each other even in very sick patients
8705409 if the results are validated in further studies this may assist physicians in making important patient management decisions in patients with acute neurological disorders
8705410 the new data fit well with the previous results in mice because improved neurological status is likely to go along with increased communication between brain cells
8705411 we havent measured how brain injury affects amyloid beta inside cells nor have we determined whether brain injury affects the ability of amyloid beta to form small aggregates that may be especially harmful
8705412 senator obamma what have you done and what have you run when you look at those two questions the answer is not much and nothing

8705417 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8705418 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8705419 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper preflight pose
8705420 is transformed into an appropriate pattern of leg and body motion prior to take off
8705421 this is a rather sophisticated sensory to motor transformation and the search is on to find the place in the brain where this happens
8705422 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter

8705425 this made bankruptcy in the us a viable alternative to a uk insolvency and given the dollar pound exchange rate us bankruptcy was dramatically less expensive
8705426 candidly the charity simply did not have the funds to institute an insolvency proceeding in england

8705441 we strongly recommend restrictions in the use of thiazolidinediones the class of drugs and question the rationale for leaving rosiglitazone on the market

8705451 the new outbreaks are likely related to two consecutive days of wet weather that occurred in south alabama approximately 2 1 2 weeks ago and not due to tropical storm fay
8705452 the effect of fay on soybean rust in alabama will be more evident in the next week or two
8705453 it should take another 7 to 14 days before we begin to see the full effect of tropical storm fay on the spread of soybean rust

8705602 if you look at the adipose tissue there are actually signs of disease theres inflammation theres stress in all kinds of organelles internal cell parts and its a very safe guess although that hasnt been directly proven that these abnormalities will impair the function
8705603 what the adipose tissue primarily is supposed to do is take care of excess calories to store these calories in the form of fat
8705604 they calories go into the liver youre going to have a fatty liver and it may end up as cirrhosis or a cancerous liver

8705609 intermarried couples from outside the community are i think increasingly seen by many orthodox jews as people not to be summarily rejected at least if there is any chance of the non jewish partners sincere and halachic conversion
8705610 there are so many examples of couples ive worked with where even if theres not a conversion initially over time the non jewish partner begins to feel more open to conversion especially when theyre doing it of their own accord and not because of pressure orthodox parents have witnessed that and most rabbis will come down on the side of keeping the relationship with an intermarried child going

8705651 how could the wtc towers have collapsed without a controlled demolition
8705652 nist concluded that the wtc towers collapsed because 1 the impact of the planes severed and damaged support columns dislodged fireproofing insulation coating the steel floor trusses and steel columns and widely dispersed jet fuel over multiple floors and 2 the subsequent unusually large jet fuel ignited multi floor fires weakened the now susceptible structural steel
8705653 the building section above came down essentially in free fall as seen in videos
8705654 the structure below the level of collapse initiation offered minimal resistance to the falling building mass at and above the impact zone
8705655 the core of the building which carried primarily gravity loads was made up of a mixture of massive box columns
8705656 the core columns were designed to carry the gravity loads and were loaded to approximately 50 of their capacity before the aircraft impact the exterior columns were loaded to only approximately 20 of their capacity before the aircraft impact
8705657 did the nist investigation look for evidence of the wtc towers being brought down by controlled demolition
8705658 nist did not test for the residue of these compounds in the steel
8705659 the results established that this type of assembly was capable of sustaining a large gravity load without collapsing for a substantial period of time relative to the duration of the fires in any given location on september 11th
8705660 unable to provide a full explanation of the total collapse
8705661 diagram 1 typical wtc 7 floor showing locations of columns numbered the buckling of column 79 was the initiating event that led to the collapse of wtc 7 the buckling resulted from fire induced damage to floors around column 79 failure of the girder between columns 44 and 79 and cascading floor failures
8705662 it is entirely possible parts of the steel could be have melted
8705663 there is no evidence that there was molten steel in the building when it was standing there is no way that you could have had molten steel in the building when it was standing and if youre alluding to the molten metal that was seen on the ne corner of the 82nd or 81st floor of tower 2 some minutes before the building collapsed that was a isolated incident where molten steel molten material not molten steel molten material was seen coming out it was a silverish silverish color molten material
8705664 just because thermite or thermate exists in some dust particles does not necessarily translate into thermate being the cause of building failure theres no theory around it theyre just observations isolated observations
8705665 the collection of things you said do not add up to a theory they add to up to simply pure and simple speculation

8705677 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities
8705678 it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8705679 the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8705680 why seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process it is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side and the job is done
8705681 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8705682 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational

8705686 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8705687 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8705688 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8705689 for the russians to say they are not responsible for what happened in georgia is ludicrous russia is to blame for this crisis and the world is responding to what russia has done

8705692 if it were true that older kids are able to learn at a faster rate then the differences in test scores should get bigger as kids progress and the material gets more difficult but we really see the opposite
8705693 at the end of the line somehow that year will catch up with them
8705694 they start work a year later and parents have an extra year of child care costs if they delay so its not free
8705695 what we think is going on is that teachers are comparing younger kids to older classmates and the younger kids tend to stand out
8705696 they stand out either as not doing well or they tend to stand out as being more hyperactive
8705697 the thing is schools are making profound decisions based on these differences differences that tend to fade away
8705698 whether they go to school earlier or later thats really not going to matter much at the end of the day

8705703 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8705704 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas
8705705 but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8705706 but what really incensed me was when i was told i could not change
8705707 i asked if it was pants they didnt like and would lloyds is rubbish do but they didnt think so
8705708 so i tried barclays is better and that didnt go down too well either
8705709 the rules seemed to change and they told me it had to be one word so i tried censorship but they didnt like that and then said it had to be no more than six letters long

8705725 russian prime minister vladimir putin said on thursday he suspected someone in the united states provoked the conflict in georgia in an attempt to help a candidate in the u s presidential election
8705726 it is not just that the american side could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army

8705770 o meu segundo plano o seguinte n s dividiremos o ex rcito do rei bom n s semearemos sementes de dissens o entre eles ent o em vez de um s ex rcito teremos cem grupos pequenos eles n o saber o lutar juntos n s os dividiremos e os derrotaremos
8705771 e este meu terceiro plano n s convenceremos o ex rcito do rei bom que eles deveriam deixar qualquer um se alistar no seu ex rcito falaremos que um ex rcito grande glorioso e que qualquer um que esteja disposto a vestir um uniforme pode se unir n s enviaremos secretamente alguns dos nossos soldados para se alistarem no ex rcito deles eles ser o divididos uns contra os outros e o ex rcito deles estar cheio de pessoas que s o leais a mim o inimigo deles

8705944 se voi volete 12 500 euro lente in questione ne chiede il doppio quindi io continuer il mio lavoro e voi dovrete sparire per sempre
8705945 bisogna abolire lo spirito di rassegnazione sostiene limprenditore io credo che non esista un essere superiore allaltro perch si mettono al mondo i figli se non per farli crescere in un mondo migliore e questo il nostro compito e noi abbiamo il dovere di lottare per il loro bene

8705952 bob barr our libertarian presidential candidate is being kept off the ballot in at least two states west virginia and maine because of missed deadlines when ralph nader tried to run as an independent in 2004 he was kept off the texas ballot because he filed after the deadline
8705953 texas law doesnt make any exceptions for absurdly late nominating conventions although bob barr should win texas by default i expect the republicans and democrats will get away with breaking the laws they made they get away with breaking their promises to voters all the time its a travesty that we have a double standard where republicans and democrats are above the law but other parties and independents have to comply with every letter of the law

8705973 it was difficult for us but weve got through so it has been a positive day all round
8705974 we kept on knocking on the door they were in the box seat and could afford to get people behind the ball and play the counter attack
8705975 we always had to be mindful of that but in the end we got our rewards
8705976 after an hours play i thought we upped our energy levels and our play was more progressive
8705977 from that point onwards through extra time there was only one team that looked like they were going to nick it
8705978 we had a couple of chances michael johnson could very well have won it before the end of play
8705979 but well take the result it doesnt matter how we go through
8705980 its a bit of a lottery with penalties but were delighted weve overcome this hurdle
8705981 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities
8705982 it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8705983 the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8705984 why seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process it is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side and the job is done

8705995 crediamo che alla scuola ha detto il ministro serva ordine e chiarezza per questo ci sar un ritorno dei voti accompagnati dai giudizi che saranno esplicativi del risultato raggiunto dai ragazzi si abusato dei giudizi che a mio parere non sempre sono espressi in maniera comprensibile e aiutano a capire il reale rendimento dei ragazzi

8706005 i truly believe that people like myself who are in a position of entertainers in the limelight should keep their mouth shut on politics because at the end of the day im good at writing songs and singing
8706006 what im not educated in is the field of political science and so for me to be sharing my views and influencing people of who i think they should be voting for i think would be very irresponsible on my part

8706019 and are they really that worried about him looking the least bit vulnerable
8706020 i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
8706021 i think that the notion that the members of the senate who were in the ground forces or who were ashore in vietnam have a very different view of vietnam and the cost that you described than john mccain does because he was in isolation essentially for many of those year so i think to some extent his national security experience in that regard is sadly limited
8706022 everything is looked at from his life experiences from always having been in the military and i think that can be pretty dangerous its one thing to have been drafted and served but another thing when you come from generations of military people and thats just how youre steeped how youve learned how youve grown up

8706031 eu acho que o pr sal uma propriedade de 190 milh es de brasileiros portanto n s vamos fazer com que essa riqueza oriunda da natureza possa favorecer n o apenas o conjunto da sociedade brasileira mas entre elas as pessoas mais pobres
8706032 eu acho que temos que trabalhar com muito carinho o que vamos fazer com o resultado deste petr leo para que o brasil saia ganhando como um todo
8706033 se os recursos do pr sal forem aquilo que imaginamos o brasil dentro de alguns anos se transformar em um grande produtor de petr leo n o podemos nos dar ao luxo de desperdi ar essa imensa riqueza n o porque tiramos bilhete premiado que vamos sair por a gastando dinheiro que ainda n o temos o pr sal o passaporte para o futuro

8706043 impressed with what congressman mcnerney has done in his short tenure in office
8706044 hes back in california every weekend in fact its nearly impossible to spend a saturday in stockton without running into him
8706045 hes committed to serving his constituents well by helping create family wage jobs in renewable energy bringing home federal funds for important infrastructure projects in our region working to make sure veterans have access to services theyve earned and being open available and accessible to members of our community he puts the needs of his constituents first thats why he earns my endorsement

8706049 why is there a religious group to promote the right to abortion
8706050 we founded this organization in 1973 because of the passage of roe v wade
8706051 from 1973 to 1990 teen pregnancies in the african american community went up 700 percent this has fueled an explosion of the drug culture and aids
8706052 what would you say to those religious groups who disagree with your position on moral grounds
8706053 i respect their disagreement but i believe that women are moral agents who should decide what is the correct moral choice
8706054 blacks could only sit down behind that line if the back of the bus was entirely full a black could stand in the front half of the bus but could not sit down in any seat in the front even if the entire front half of the entire bus was empty i remember watching my mother standing in front of empty seats and not understanding why
8706055 republicans who are mocking obamas appearance havent mentioned it but george w bush accepted his own nomination in 2004 on a set with a similar neoclassical theme with columns rising on either side of him as the pictures above and below show indeed the bush set and the obama sets currently look strikingly similar with the podium set well in front of the columns and connected by a path
8706056 we havent announced 3g pricing as of yet for now data pricing remains the same as it has been

8706072 what motivated me when i was that young living in paris out of an agency house was that it truly gave me an added advantage to get a jump start on what i truly wanted to achieve with my life in modeling

8706076 im a pretty tough boot camp sergeant and i demand perfection in myself and expect it from the people around me especially keeping the kids focused honestly i dont expect anything from the kids that i dont do myself
8706077 all i did was eat sleep and exercise modeling it was 24 7 modeling so executive producer stuart krasnow and i both wanted to incorporate that and to provide for the boys and girls proper nutrition proper health proper finance all things that your average model wont receive unless youre living in a house like this this is the first of its kind

8706123 the bullet was a through and through shot meaning it went through the leg
8706124 we are currently interviewing and investigating all angles of this case
8706125 we do not believe this was a random shooting and that the shooter knew the group
8706126 the cpi m does not want india to go for the nuclear deal but they do not have any objection to china going for the deal can they not be called agents
8706127 the cpi m has opposed india signing the gatt treaty and inclusion in the wto now even china has entered wto and wants most favoured nation status from the us
8706128 does the deal mean that we cannot make nuclear bombs the answer is we can no one can influence our military strategy the only condition is that we cannot send our reactors to any other country
8706129 being a union minister i can responsibly say that no foreign country can interfere in indias military strategy once the india us nuclear agreement gets operational
8706130 even if the victim in a given case has been promiscuous in her sexual behaviour earlier she has a right to refuse to submit herself to sexual intercourse to anyone and everyone because she is not a vulnerable object or prey for being sexually assaulted by anyone and everyone
8706131 even if it is hypothetically accepted that the victim had lost her virginity earlier it did not and cannot in law give licence to any person to rape her
8706132 the money released by the central government goes till lucknow but never reaches the poor unless and until the poor of india including those of uttar pradesh progress the country cannot move forward
8706133 allahabad is the ancestral home of our family and i am very happy to visit the city
8706134 the way the nsui activists were suppressed and implicated under false sections of ipc indian penal code is quite shocking the voice of youths is being suppressed in allahabad
8706135 i read the stone engraving describing his nehrus experiences in the jail one thing is clear the leaders of those times rose from grassroot level and could be termed the true sons of the soil of our country
8706136 however the political leaders of the present including i are not able to reach that much to the public
8706137 over 20 districts are hit by floods during my recent visits to amethi and sultanpur i came to know about the problems faced by the flood hit i will be visiting more and more flooded districts soon and ensure proper relief work
8706138 the cpi m firmly stands for the right to strike by the working class as a fundamental right
8706139 it has consistently supported the all india general strikes of the trade unions against the neo liberal policies of the central government and other urgent issues of the working class and toiling people
8706140 personally i dont support strikes bandhs shutdowns do not help the country
8706141 unfortunately i belong to a political party they call strikes and i keep mum
8706142 it was my goal to build a challenging schedule that would allow us to grow as a program as well as enjoy our time on the road with the places we visit
8706143 hardly anyone on the team has been to philadelphia so i am hoping for us to go to independence hall climb rockys steps and have some fun while we are there

8706156 im here for the cops and the firefighters the teachers and the assembly line workers the folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the american dream endures
8706157 and because barack obama made that choice working families in illinois pay less taxes and more people have moved from welfare to the dignity of work and he got it done
8706158 if elected president obamas promises would mean even more taxes painful taxes when times are tough enough
8706159 im going to keep current tax rates low and cut others not because i want to make the rich richer but because it keeps jobs in america and creates new ones

8706167 id have to say no because hollywood has not seen a lot of return on movies like that me not a lot of return with the anti american movies produced as morale boosters for our enemies in iraq and santa monica however should anyone out there in movieland be interested in a profit vantage point the pro american war on terror film did make money just saying its a spy thriller and is set against that backdrop it actually has interesting ideas and is thought provoking
8706168 more and more were seeing people willing to take that on and really bust that idea out but this one doesnt really do that it kind of tiptoes around it instead of taking it on fully i dont think our movie really does it has elements that get into it
8706169 because hollywood hasnt see a lot of return on movies like that

8706178 we havent even begun to see the numbers of student veterans who will be coming here with the new gi bill we are just starting to see some of the students from the very first wave in iraq and we are just now beginning to see them but i can tell you that in another five to 10 years were going to see an onslaught of veterans enrolling at the ua
8706179 this is the entree we want to provide them with the resources they need for academic success here
8706180 in many cases their confidence levels are not high coming back many of these people went into the military thinking that they wouldnt be successful in higher education this helps them get back on track
8706181 our programmatic mission was to learn about this group and to teach faculty how to successfully work with a cohort not a lot of people have not had a lot of success with
8706182 were in the very early stages literally in the first month and laying the groundwork for the project

8706184 has a very quick release and a quick first step going to his left he doesnt like contact and tends to float on the perimeter a little bit
8706185 the program is unusual in that it provides teachers with an opportunity to work in a school to participate in a service project with the gal pagos national park and to travel to a number of the most interesting islands in the archipelago
8706186 what could be a better experience for a teacher to have than to help teach a variety of science subjects to bring alive the study of ecology evolution conservation and the history of science it enables them to share their personal experiences photos and stories with their students
8706187 they get to know people and participate in the conservation of the islands and learn enough about the local issues on the islands so they can be able to appreciate the complexities of some of the many conservation issues
8706188 not only was i able to experience and study wildlife and ecosystems that are completely unique to the gal pagos islands but i was able to be immersed in a culture so different from my own and form friendships both with people from the islands and with my fellow students
8706189 that has changed my life in many ways it sounds clich but it truly was the most incredible month of my life
8706190 i have to say that the experience will definitely enhance my teaching where do i start what an incredible opportunity to have first hand knowledge of the islands and the uniqueness of their physical features and biology will enrich the learning experience of my students and classes
8706191 i have come to take for granted how accessible the wildlife is here i have swam with hundreds of dolphins in the open ocean with sharks sea turtles and eagle rays penguins and schools and schools of beautiful fish yellow tailed surgeons and pacific creole as well as diving down to inspect the outrageously colored parrotfish and damselfishes
8706192 het is nu 40 jaar geleden dat de hervormde school in uithuizen werd opgeheven de aanleiding was een fusie met de gereformeerde school een en ander vonden wij een mooie aanleiding om de historie vast te leggen

8706195 it was difficult for us but weve got through so it has been a positive day all round
8706196 we kept on knocking on the door they were in the box seat and could afford to get people behind the ball and play the counter attack
8706197 we always had to be mindful of that but in the end we got our rewards
8706198 after an hours play i thought we upped our energy levels and our play was more progressive
8706199 from that point onwards through extra time there was only one team that looked like they were going to nick it
8706200 we had a couple of chances michael johnson could very well have won it before the end of play
8706201 but well take the result it doesnt matter how we go through
8706202 its a bit of a lottery with penalties but were delighted weve overcome this hurdle
8706203 youre always relieved there are no easy games its a cliche but in europe there arent look at the events of last night with liverpool
8706204 im delighted we showed a lot of character and i saw qualities and values in the team that i really liked tonight
8706205 pflichtaufgabe erf llt mehr ist dazu nichts zu sagen die erste 20 minuten waren gut danach haben wir aufgeh rt zu spielen
8706206 wir hatten vielleicht schon die bayern in den k pfen
8706207 wir haben vier f nf hundertprozentige chancen vergeben in der zweiten halbzeit hatten wir wohl die bayern schon im kopf

8706214 i know that everton are a big club who have a history of playing in important competitions like the uefa cup
8706215 i hope i can do my best for the team
8706216 it is the quickest way for scotland to disappear off the international stage
8706217 it is about the identity of the countries and it is a matter for the football associations
8706218 but when i was in scotland and chief executive of the scottish fa we had a clear and firm position and i understand that is still the position that scotland should not take part in an olympic gb team
8706219 fifa is comprised 208 countries and we have had situations in the past when the privileges of the british associations one of which is to compete separately in international football tournaments has come under attack
8706220 what i would say is that we should be very careful about that as its difficult to see what guarantees can be given
8706221 as a young entrepreneur you will have no work life balance i am very serious about this if you want to succeed you need to be working 24 7 every day of the week

8706239 john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8706240 let us declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8706241 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8706242 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8706243 and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8706244 to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the effort to take america back
8706245 de tegelbijbel vormt een uitdagende interpretatie vaak opwindend zelfs het werk geeft een heel bijzondere blik op de bijbel
8706246 de tegelbijbel is een ongewone en verrassende ontmoeting met gods woord
8706247 men heeft wellicht wel interesse in het uitbrengen van gedeeltes in de vorm van aparte brochures ons doel was echter om de bijbel als geheel met wandtegelillustraties uit te brengen een andere vorm zou niet in de geest van ons project zijn
8706248 he enjoys it here but he wants to play regularly i work with him and all the players and i think the reason he joined us is because he believes in what were trying to do and he can play a big part in that
8706249 ive said to him i want him to be part of this football club i understand that he wants to play and he will be causing me headaches in terms of selection
8706250 his attitude to not starting at the moment has been first class hes had a big impact for us from the bench and hes pushing hard to be in the starting line up
8706251 it is like buses you wait 20 years for a left winger and then two turn up at once
8706252 i must be one of the most unfortunate people in football in that respect
8706253 it is very frustrating sat on the bench week in week out watching games i am 21 now and i need to be doing something i want to play
8706254 its no secret the manager knows that and weve had a few chats in pre season about my position and a lot of things have been mentioned like transfers and loans
8706255 i want to be a boro player theres no doubt about that i think we are on the verge of big things here
8706256 it is nice to be involved in such attacking play hopefully against yeovil i showed the manager what i can do
8706257 my preference is to stay here but you never know in football we have a small squad and hopefully i am next in line to get a chance but i cant wait forever
8706258 the disappointing thing for us is that gerrard will have to have a groin operation in the morning
8706259 he will be out for around 10 to 15 days he needs to have the operation because he has been in a lot of pain we knew he had this problem before he went on international duty with england last week for the friendly against the czech republic but yesterday i spoke with the club doctor and with steven and he agreed he needed the operation
8706260 it is not a serious injury ten to 15 days is not long but he needs it
8706261 matuidi has an important work rate and can run like a mad during 90 minutes and more like flamini good passer he scored a beautiful goal last saturday too very good defensively good tackler too what we need

8706263 ik hoor van veel meer ouders dat je als fietser op deze plek in leek het risico loopt omver te worden gereden jonge kinderen op de fiets zijn voor dit soort volwassenen geen partij waar komt dit rare gedrag vandaan
8706264 laatst zag ik zelfs hoe een politieman in burgerauto voorrang nam ten koste van een fietser zonder dat hij het recht hiertoe had ach ja agenten zijn ook maar gewone mensen
8706265 i think a legitimate question is do the candidates have the requisite experience judgment track record accomplishment to be president of the united states
8706266 and i think a critical and fair review of barack obamas credentials would answer that question no
8706267 i would note i have been a governor for six years commander in chief of the minnesota national guard for six years and before that i was the majority leader of the minnesota legislature i have some other life experiences as well

8706373 instability on global financial markets has been the main factor in house price hikes in moscow
8706374 after the stagnation of late 2006 mid 2007 pent up demand set off a buying spree among those who had moved away from stock and currency markets and into real estate
8706375 prices for apartments in khru shchev era five story blocks standard and modern panel buildings i e residential properties in the economy segment did not show a drop nor did they stop rising for a single week of the year as a result whereas average asking prices in 2008 grew by approximately 23 24 percent prices in the five story walk up category rose sig ni ficantly higher by more than 30 percent
8706376 the first four months of the year witnessed robust growth on the primary market
8706377 there were several reasons such as instability on the russian stock market at the start of the year rising inflation decline of the dollar and rumors about the re denomination of the ruble as a result many people hastened to invest their savings in real estate properties and thus provoked sellers into pushing up prices
8706378 compared with the start of 2008 overall supply on the moscow market fell by 5 percent the reason for this is that construction projects in the economy and medium price range have been moving to areas just out of the capital
8706379 supply in the panel block segment shrank by 26 percent while supply in the medium price range declined by 23 percent
8706380 instead of the usual 22 000 to 23 000 properties only 15 000 were available in march while by may the number declined to 12 000 mean while alternative transactions became difficult it may take several months to arrange a transaction scheme and in this time the seller can raise the asking price and ruin the deal overnight
8706381 what stops you from buying an apartment through a mortgage loan
8706382 but as a result of higher interest rates the demand to provide guarantors and confirmation of official income as well as limits imposed on the amount of loans home buyers have started looking for other options
8706383 mortgages have become less affordable mortgage deals in moscow in the first half of 2007 accounted for 15 per cent of total transactions now this share has plummeted to 5 10 per cent of the total
8706384 i strive for the huddle to be very relaxed and everyone focused on me
8706385 it has been that way if things go wrong if you have a dropped ball or a fumble and we recover you want guys to come back to the huddle and say hey you know what guys my fault ill get the next one
8706386 when you get that it reassures confidence in everyone else im not here yelling at everyone my job is to provide confidence i tell guys im coming right back to them and i need them
8706387 if you can get the feeling of youre up 21 youre going to play a lot better when you start thinking about stuff and worrying about stuff that messes your game up and slows you down a little bit it comes from experience but you have to be able to be in that situation where this is no problem were just going to roll down the field and get where we have to get
8706388 hes the president of the group he gets us in the positions we need to be in hes real loose and i like that about donovan hes not so uptight in the huddle that affects everybody when the person leading is relaxed and confident then everyone else is going to feel that and try to display that same attribute that he has

8706393 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8706394 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8706395 i think from the beginning there were a lot of critics saying that this couldnt be done that he couldnt turn his life around
8706396 hes proven everyone wrong hes got a very bright personal and professional future
8706397 theres no sure thing in life its nice to finally get the affirmation for all the hard work hes put in
8706398 the rest is up to him its time to play football hes a very motivated player i think hes matured greatly through this he has a good head on his shoulders he should be fine
8706399 youre not going to tackle this guy with an arm tackle
8706400 they want him to have 30 carries or 20 carries whatever it is in the run game and get his throws in if we dont stop him well have a difficult time keeping them out of the end zone
8706401 im going to let kurt roper call the plays because of our no huddle status

8706403 i like calculated risks all the time im going to continue to maintain that kind of attitude i have a lot of confidence right now in what our specialists are going to do they have been challenged by me and they have responded well
8706404 i dont know that we can run for more yards than them if theyre committed to it and thats all they want to do
8706405 but were going to run the football better i promise you were going to run the football better i would love to have our starting tailback available but hes not for this ball game were going to do it with who we have and im anxious to see how those young men respond
8706406 i was just so happy for him i got to thinking about what the man has done you hang your hat on everything he talked about the thing that got down to me was teamwork and team nothing else really mattered to him other than that team and you could tell that i think thats the reason he was the right guy to pull that off theres no doubt it took a coach of his caliber to make those guys a team and it sure was a bunch of fun to watch

8706417 we do not anticipate any major reduction in the number of western tourists to russia due to the events in georgia similarly the troubles in chechnya did not seem to have much impact on travel to the country
8706418 the largest factors impacting on travel to russia are factors of the cost and ease of obtaining visas the cost of hotels and levels of service
8706419 it is too early to assume but i doubt it the conflict will stop ordinary tourists and businessmen coming to russia because russia has not created any restrictions for foreign nationals after the recent events

8706435 there were so many charlatans claiming they could cure you of anything some practiced eastern medicine others said they used ancient folk wisdom some even claimed that they could perform magic and they made these claims openly one man even went on television and told viewers to put bottles of water in front of the television set then he waved his arms around and said that he had turned the water into a medicine for whatever ailed the viewer
8706436 people would take these potions and then convince themselves that they were well again and go about their normal business while in reality their condition was getting worse

8706458 i dont think ive blown myself out of it i could have done but i didnt
8706459 even if someone has to cart me into the car on sunday and ive done all i can i can be pleased and proud of myself
8706460 boys are called up for military service straight out of technical colleges while only a fraction of them return from the military to the construction industry which seriously affects the manpower problem in the sector this is why we would like work on a construction site to be equated to alternative civilian service
8706461 it is very difficult today to find a qualified foreman or supervisor employers are ready to pay construction managers very high wages which only fuels prices in the construction industry the reason for all of that is that at present there is no viable private state partnership
8706462 any questions about the vice presidency thats obviously sen mccains decision and the mccain campaign will be making those announcements

8706543 sex with students is bad but why should it be the case that for women its a case of poor boundaries and for men its hardcore brutal predation of the most evil sort
8706544 most of these women experts say dont go into teaching with plans to seduce a child the way a classic pedophile does what leads to their downfall is emotional immaturity
8706545 these teachers have a poor concept of boundaries so they dont recognize when theyve crossed the line into inappropriate behavior
8706546 in a lot of these cases the woman thinks she has fallen in love
8706547 but most of these women come from conflict ridden families where they didnt learn healthy social skills many learned to get their emotional needs for love attention approval met through sexual behavior

8706554 we expect more consumers will take advantage of security freeze protection as it becomes easier to use
8706555 consumers across the country deserve the same easy ability to use the freeze to keep crooks out of their credit files and to lift it quickly when theyre applying for new credit
8706556 the credit bureaus should make it just as convenient for consumers in all 50 states to use the security freeze to protect themselves from identity thieves

8706569 the public will be angered that the home office is seeking to take serious powers that should be appropriately applied by the police and encouraging them to be given not just to local councils but also to private firms
8706570 the public want to see real police on the streets discharging these responsibilities not private firms who may use them inappropriately including unnecessarily snooping on the lives of ordinary citizens

8706576 its also of concern that most of the perpetrators are closely related to the victims
8706577 we are disappointed that methodist church leaders have not given the opportunity to their members to make up their own minds
8706578 this would have happened had they accepted the offer from the national council for building a better fiji to explain the charter
8706579 while the charter proposes some noble principles the conference is of the view that the interim government and the national council for building a better fiji do not have any moral or legal authority to impose it on the people

8706581 some of the bench warrants are several years old and these officers will be here for a fortnight to ensure they are executed
8706582 the court evaders faced cases ranging from theft robbery non payment of fines and maintenance defaulters
8706583 bench warrants were issued against them because they did not appear in court on given dates
8706584 their cases have been hanging in a limbo for many years because they have failed to keep to their court dates
8706585 when something is founded on deceit nothing good comes out of it and this is what exactly happened to the school when it was handed to the church headquarters the standard kept going down and even efforts by the parents to improve the school proved futile

8706591 the teams are taking response forms and they will have to come back with responses that will have to tally with the number of forms given out
8706592 the teams are made up of charter officials from suva and our own people who work at divisional and district level who are managing the registers which will have to be signed off by the member leading the team
8706593 no there is no independent team overseeing our work as this is not an election

8706604 i was raised in labasa and also wanted to be a contestant one day to be part of an event that helps raise funds for the unfortunate in society
8706605 todays im just enjoying the day with these really cuddly babies
8706606 they were scrambling around looking for water and when they did get some they managed to put out part of the blaze but they ran out of water again and had to go looking for more
8706607 but meantime the fire raged out of control and consumed everything in its path
8706608 they were calling 917 or 919 when they really should have been calling 911 thats a real shame because we had already done awareness on this
8706609 they tried to extinguish the fire themselves and a passing firefighter alerted us and by the time our truck arrived the fire had engulfed the whole house
8706610 i have lost a lot i can estimate that i have lost about 100 000 worth of property in this fire
8706611 my brother lived there at about 9 30pm he felt heat and then knocked on our house door waking up my wife who was alone at that time so they both rushed out of the house because the fire was spreading so quickly
8706612 i was away at that time but my son called me so i rushed home to see the blaze
8706613 it all happened so quickly because it was a wooden home and we had just painted it
8706614 worship basically means service done to god and people so all matters related to the welfare of members should be discussed in the church that was why the charter was discussed and the church took the stand it believes in to oppose it
8706615 we want to move the nation forward in a legitimate manner and that is why we oppose the document
8706616 a common name would have implications on other documents close to indigenous fijians and this would have negative impacts in the long run
8706617 daylight robbery and its a pity that only fijians were used through the army to promote the charter
8706618 the charter promotes individualism and this leads to selfishness as people become an island of their own failing to fulfill the greatest commandment of loving thy neighbor as you love yourself
8706619 facing years in jail for a conviction of a single particular charge
8706620 in fact all the charges were municipal court violations that do not carry such penalties
8706621 it is not clear whether any order to disperse was given no legal observer sic witness or arrestee on the scene weve debriefed heard any order to disperse
8706622 numerous persons including legal observers asked to be able to leave the blockaded area and were refused
8706623 after the arrests attorneys from the peoples law project and the aclu arrived at the temporary arrestee processing site to conduct confidential attorney client consultations
8706624 the city refused to provide any access to allow these persons to meet with attorneys
8706625 i personally saw one such arrestee later at the city and county building i saw her marched from the elevator to the courtroom in bare feet and leg shackles i saw her appear in bare feet and leg shackles
8706626 some arrestees who could not make their own bond spent 6 7 8 or more hours waiting at taps before being transferred to court
8706627 the only access we were given to those clients was to whisper
8706628 attorneys were at the court from 11 pm on the night of aug 25 2008 and were staying until each and every arrestee came to the city and county building
8706629 the nature of our operations doesnt require that we carry both
8706630 transport canada was satisfied that we met the regulation and they approved the change
8706631 a lot of these airlines say well our passengers are our main concern thats a bit of a misnomer
8706632 it was extra above and beyond what was required under the canadian aviation regulations

8706634 the 14 very large distributors that we have signed for distribution will rapidly increase our volume sales from the next two months and we are excited that finally we have broken all barriers to entry into the us market
8706635 we have distributors that have turnover in excess of us 100million 158 9m and are very large reputed and established alcoholic and non alcoholic distributors in usa many of our distributors are budweiser and miller coors beer houses
8706636 island chill has secured a large distributor in uk and middle east and will soon be fijis recognised bottled water exporter
8706637 the business will now operate on a different level of operation and there will be some extensive change in the management structure to cope with this exponential growth
8706638 we will now audit all funds in the circuits and divisions to give us a justified financial position of the church and this is why we are taking a top bottom approach
8706639 the practice will take time to sink in with the people because fijians are good in receiving and spending but poor in recording
8706640 changed the perception of what the fashion industry is all about
8706641 the number of litigations is increasing and the awards from the courts is also drawing our attention
8706642 we are not sitting doing nothing the cost is a huge draw on our finances and we cannot afford it not to mention that this negligence is affecting the lives of people psc is concerned at the prevalence of such cases
8706643 this is why we decided to meet with the ministry of health to discuss insurance of those in the profession especially nowadays when people are educated they know their rights its not like ten years ago where people facing the same problems just let it slide because of ignorance of the law and their rights

8706653 stu was a consummate professional on and off the ice throughout his career and was the type of player who always exhibited the qualities you would associate with a future coach stu will be an excellent addition to our staff which we feel is among the best in the league rick wilson has played a major role in building the stars franchise into the perennial contender that it is today we believe mark lamb is one of the top young assistants in the game and a major asset to our organization
8706654 i was truly fortunate to play as long as i did and i knew this was the time for me to wrap up my playing days
8706655 a great opportunity to become an assistant coach was presented to me by the stars and i look forward to making that transition and learning a new part of the game

8706659 when you have the water chestnuts you cant do anything there are some great bass in fisk pond and once you get those water chestnuts you cant get to them good for the bass bad for the fishermen
8706660 they attach to birds and animals and then move to another pond
8706661 you have the broad leaves on the surface that take in light for growth and then you have leaves under the water that use the residual light to grow the plant
8706662 you have to start the harvesting before the seeds on the water chestnut mature and drop in the late summer early fall the seeds mature and drop and now you have a whole new crop for the season im sure we wont get it all so well have to come back next year
8706663 youre filling in your lake youre losing your pond youre losing it as a resource
8706664 the respondents by lowering the mandatory retirement age of civil servants to 55 without the agreement of the affected party had acted in breach of section 38 of the constitution which protects an individual from discrimination on the basis of age
8706665 having access to clean safe drinkable water anywhere in the world is key for local communities not only survive but thrive
8706666 thats why westpac is proud to be a key supporter of the rotary pacific water for life foundation as we have been since its inception in november last year

8706671 were fortunate we were able to make an arrest in this case the patrol officers handled it well and responded quickly
8706672 it has affected us but at a slight margin as our suppliers have been lenient enough not to inflate prices to an extreme
8706673 members in this group have utilised their skills in handicraft and other related works that have assisted tremendously in their endeavors to reform
8706674 members have always found it difficult to be accepted within the community being stereotyped as ex prisoners
8706675 however their work has been recognised within the commercial and domestic market as a valuable commodity
8706676 this has assisted greatly and boosted the confidence of members who are examining the business aspects of their hard work
8706677 with the current economic and political climate it is understood that businesses are feeling the pinch
8706678 however without the contributions and the assistance of these groups we cannot assist in the reform of those who greatly need assistance
8706679 we are lucky because now we have just been given our business licence to sell our products and ware in nadi
8706680 we are thankful to the district officer nadi in granting our association a permit to conduct our businesses in the area
8706681 i know greg would have been proud of the way his staff acquitted themselves in servicing the leaders meetings
8706682 not only as the secretary general of the secretariat but through his illustrious career as an australian diplomat to the many pacific island countries he worked in and was accredited to
8706683 he was simply a good man and a great mentor and leader who led from the front
8706684 he invested in goodness and prudent leadership not for his own personal gain but for the benefit of the many young men and women he had mentored in australia and the pacific
8706685 we are not complaining we are only saying that life has been tough for us
8706686 we are going through difficulties in life to ensure that he lives a comfortable life
8706687 ever since he was born i have never been to town with my wife one of us has to stay back at home
8706688 he has to eat meat everyday we just eat rice and dhal
8706689 when i got out i said that i was going to change my life for the better because i had a young family to think of
8706690 but my family and members from my village of nakavu did not want me or my family there
8706691 we managed to get a place to stay in navakai where i started doing working on my small plantation enough to help my family survive
8706692 all i asked for was to be given a chance to prove myself that i am not a nuisance to society or the same person i was when i was in prison and before that
8706693 i know times are difficult today but we all have to earn a living somehow
8706694 im very grateful to my employer harry wong for giving me that break
8706695 i know where radike is coming from because i too had spent some time inside for traffic offences

8706697 it is our job to liaise with ngos and whoever wants to assist the prisoner when theyre released
8706698 we are so thankful for stakeholders within like the salvation army
8706699 i had a problem lately with a 55 year old woman that had no place to go to when she was discharged
8706700 i contacted the salvation army and had a talk with one of the officers about accommodation
8706701 the biggest question was the second key out of prison which is acceptance from their families the general public church the government and place where they look for job
8706702 female prisoners are taught to sew range of materials vocational training include catering baking cooking and setting up for functions whether it was breakfast lunch or dinner
8706703 the prevalence of this type of criminal activity and the fact that it seems to be well organised and resourced demands that the court pass appropriately long custodial sentences
8706704 the robbery with violence of the home owners in this case was carried out by a group of men including the appellant who travelled all the way from suva to qila in taveuni for the sole purpose of carrying out their criminal enterprise
8706705 i make this plea to you learn from this unfortunate turn in your life maintain a positive attitude while serving your sentence and make a fresh start in life if you do you will find that many good things still await you
8706706 educational philosophy and leadership style were incompatible with the hudson school committees expectations
8706707 anyone who is working to be a superintendent in any state under these regulatory conditions are as vulnerable as someone who coaches an nfl team
8706708 to help move the public schools from good to great instead we are beginning another academic year moving in the opposite direction
8706709 in the last two budget cycles i have been forced to reduce school staff by more than 70 employees the vast majority of them teachers and to abandon plans to bring our schools to the next level academically our investment in the education of our students is now below average in every single category

8706715 we see it in the media a lot of people being killed on our roads
8706716 mini van drivers are out there on the roads and need to be trained as basic first aiders who would be able to apply their knowledge in emergencies or when they come across an accident on their way to sigatoka or suva
8706717 for this workshop on basic first aid we have gotten the viti mini bus drivers to come and take part there are 12 psv drivers attending the workshop
8706718 most of them are surprised by what they have learnt so far and while doing practical work they are also upgrading their skills and knowledge
8706719 because they deal with the general public daily while servicing the lautoka suva nadi and sigatoka routes
8706720 they built some sort of a curriculum for their own little kids
8706721 we are delighted with the results as it is evident that air pacific is meeting customers needs when it comes to providing an easy to use convenient and timely tool for travel and bookings
8706722 i personally visited most of them who needed advice we talked to teachers and school management on their assessment of needs
8706723 they went back to the schools that weve visited and made a detailed list of needs that the schools require
8706724 last week we paid for the textbooks equipments and hopefully when we return to the schools next year there will be positive developments in terms of pass rates
8706725 i received positive feedback from teachers who perform well however if there is good performance on the teachers side schools still are not getting anywhere then we need to complement their teaching needs such as facilities and supplies
8706726 for example for industrial arts studies home economics science classes and computer classes these areas of studies need equipment and proper facilities
8706727 weve spent 1 2 million on this and i acknowledge the european union who has supported this project in terms of supplying of textbooks and the necessary equipment for the schools
8706728 new zealand is being selective when quoting that fiji is heading to be another zimbabwe
8706729 currently there is a downturn in trade with the pacific region which is only one of the two in the world where new zealand has a trade surplus
8706730 we only hope that such comments dont end up causing a wave of activism that will put pressure on new zealand businesses to put curbs on trading with fiji

8706739 it was a commercial decision that we had to follow because without having this short term suspension things will get much worse and the industry will be at threat
8706740 it was affecting our cash flow and also after buying copra sometimes we had to wait for two to three months for the shipment the temporary closure is to make sure that we will be able to start again and in a better position
8706741 even the temporary closure is a serious thing and something that has never happened before after the mills are closed where are the farmers supposed to go with their copra and who will buy it

8706743 n o foram ao juiz porque j tinham termo de identidade e resid ncia que lhes foi aplicado pela pr pria gnr ao serem constitu dos arguidos
8706744 dado que a moldura penal era inferior a 5 anos e portanto n o permitia a deten o fora de flagrante delito n o fazia sentido que fossem presentes ao juiz
8706745 neste caso uma vez que os agressores n o estavam armados e usaram apenas as m os n o existia um crit rio de proporcionalidade de for as que justificasse o uso das pistolas dos agentes
8706746 s o situa es comuns temos muitas ocorr ncias de agress es em festas ou bares ainda h dias em pias no alentejo dois colegas meus tamb m foram agredidos

8706750 we can sit here and do this all day long
8706751 well currently there are a lot of projects being undertaken and looked by the education ministry
8706752 one of them is the teacher registration board whereby teachers from next year will have to be registered before they can teach in any school
8706753 but there is nothing unusual about it because the teachers call themselves professionals
8706754 these professionals ought to have a body that watches the standard of the performance of their own members for example people like doctors lawyers accountants
8706755 this will also ensure in whatever job they are doing in this case that teaching is done properly
8706756 tens of thousands of californian families are losing their homes because they were steered into risky loans they could not afford communities throughout the state are facing plummeting property tax revenue and property values
8706757 this legislation works to restore confidence in an industry in turmoil by implementing common sense corrections
8706758 we have seen a catastrophic breakdown in the mortgage lending industry over the past two years
8706759 irresponsible subprime lending coupled with a disregard for risk management has shaken the financial markets and caused thousands of californians to lose their homes this legislation will ensure that we can prevent the next crisis in the subprime lending market while preserving homeownership opportunities for everyone

8706794 dinas a two face she wants to try to look good and stay on lindsays good side instead of being a good parent i dont give two hoots about my relationship with lindsay as a friend
8706795 one day shes going to turn around to me and tell me daddy you were right
8706796 yeah and shes demi dancing up on me and humping me from behind the one part thats not in the book is that she was lactating at the time and she was squirting breast milk at my lesbian friends my friend michelle called me the next morning and asked me how do i get breast milk out of my black dress and i said how the f ck would i know call demi it was hysterical there are no pictures of it but it actually happened the lawyers didnt think it was wise for me to print that so theres your juicy tidbit
8706797 the need for java lang thread and java sql is gone
8706798 faxless payd faxless payday loan has freed you from the frustrating task of fetching documents and lugging them to the lender office for faxing wha faxless payday loan easy money without the formalities of documentation

8706801 optimists believe this is the best of all possible worlds pessimists fear that it is true
8706802 i love my dog but my doctor say we cannot make babies i guess well adopt children and just have sechs
8706803 the individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the group if you try it you will be lonely often and sometimes frightened but no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself
8706804 optimists believe this is the best of all possible worlds pessimists fear that it is true
8706805 i love my dog but my doctor say we cannot make babies i guess well adopt children and just have sechs
8706806 the individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the group if you try it you will be lonely often and sometimes frightened but no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself
8706807 yes of course you are now we got to buckle down and save planet express
8706808 seeing a pregnant womans luminous smile hearing the happy cries of children in the playground that is what drives me
8706809 the diaper opened and the baby fell to the ground but at a much slower speed
8706810 the diaper obviously lessened the impact of the fall and saved the babys life
8706811 he could also have been killed by one of the spikes
8706812 the skill set you need in terms of the coordination and balance and things like that you cannot choose to drink and ride its just the wrong choice to make
8706813 our vision is really toward zero deaths everyone counts so were not exactly celebrating these numbers
8706814 age 21 drinking laws have been proven time and again effective in preventing deaths and injuries
8706815 the agent responded that edwards is adding to his calendar and that the fee has gone up
8706816 none of us can provide a cast iron guarantee that salmonella saintpaul will not re emerge
8706817 is an important indication that this particular outbreak is over
8706818 we just heard about it a couple of weeks ago they were trying to decide whether they wanted us and then decided they did
8706819 i think that the energy is really going to be over the top very intense and electric
8706820 the walls started moving then the bang everything started coming down everyone started screaming
8706821 our family is excited to share with you tonights historic moment of change its why im running for congress
8706822 this is a difference he wants to highlight in this race
8706823 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8706824 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8706825 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8706826 the wind blew them down quickly so we need to make some money quickly
8706827 the bullet was a through and through shot meaning it went through the leg
8706828 we are currently interviewing and investigating all angles of this case
8706829 we do not believe this was a random shooting and that the shooter knew the group
8706830 the neck is fine and 100 but he has lost a lot of weight hes well underdone in terms of conditioning
8706831 we will take some guidance from the player himself on whether hes mentally ready but i think he has been in the game long enough to know he would only go out there if he was confident he could be an effective player
8706832 ive had some sleep since ive been here so im not tired
8706833 if he had continued running the slowest he would have run would have been 9 52
8706834 oh that do you remember milton the wino in the alley he tried to start a fire but we all rushed out and put it out with our garden hoses
8706835 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8706836 cada cuatro d as muere un ciclista en espa a
8706837 es un dato que debe servir para concienciar a toda la poblaci n
8706838 las v as por las que transitan los ciclistas se comparten con el resto de veh culos por lo que tiene que haber respeto mutuo entre todos y que se cumpla la normativa
8706839 we figured out how to get the mother of all blood stem cells with the right culture conditions
8706840 there is real hope that in the future we can grow billions of blood cells at will to treat blood related disorders and just as critically if not more so weve got ace as a new old marker to guide our work
8706841 but were very pleasantly surprised to discover it as a beacon for finding the earliest blood stem cells known as well as new ways to find and manipulate this marker to make them grow
8706842 we can make lots and lots of blood cells from human stem cells for transfusions regenerate new vascular trees for heart diseases as well as create test tube factories for making transplantable blood cells that treat diseases we are very far from treatment
8706843 this is great news for stroke survivors because results clearly demonstrate that long term stroke damage is not immutable and that with exercise its never too late for the brain and body to recover
8706844 this suggests that the brain is responsible for the improvement we saw in patients walking ability it seems to be recruiting other regions to take on the job of areas damaged by stroke
8706845 many stroke survivors believe theres nothing to be gained from further rehabilitation but our results suggest that health and functional benefits from walking on a treadmill can occur even decades out from stroke
8706846 we believe exercise gives individuals a way to fight back against stroke disabilities
8706847 proving that we can directly measure amyloid beta in the human brain is an important step forward for both clinical and basic research and that may be true not just in alzheimers disease but also in other serious neurological disorders
8706848 we cant at this point rule out a very early spike in amyloid right after a brain injury
8706849 the results have potentially important clinical implications because the measurement of amyloid beta in the human brain may turn out to be a good indicator of how well brain cells are communicating with each other even in very sick patients
8706850 if the results are validated in further studies this may assist physicians in making important patient management decisions in patients with acute neurological disorders
8706851 the new data fit well with the previous results in mice because improved neurological status is likely to go along with increased communication between brain cells
8706852 we havent measured how brain injury affects amyloid beta inside cells nor have we determined whether brain injury affects the ability of amyloid beta to form small aggregates that may be especially harmful
8706853 our ultimate goal is to develop interventions that we can apply after a traumatic brain injury to improve outcomes and reduce the long term risk of alzheimers
8706854 it looks like dells margins were bad not surprised to see their margins affected given their change in distribution outlets that they are using their contributed expansion out of direct sales and to third parties
8706855 we would expect the tech group to suffer when the market opens tomorrow morning and overnight as well
8706856 id be worried for the near term for anything thats not senior debt especially common shares and preferred shares
8706857 i wouldnt be immediately concerned if my pension fund has avoided the stocks but i would be starting to think about what i can do to protect myself from what happens in the future
8706858 if its a pension plan theres nothing they can do about it
8706859 its not the decision of the end user of the pension plan its the decision of whoevers monitoring how the pension plan is being managed at the corporate level
8706860 hedging has its own risk but if thats something youre willing to accept you can use an inverse etf to hedge against additional declines in returns
8706861 if the pension fund guys are doing their job correctly i dont think thats the kind of stock that should be in a pension plan
8706862 if im managing the plan i have a fiduciary liability im going to have some questions to answer as to why im still holding onto those stocks
8706863 im guessing theyve been blown out of most of those plans
8706864 why a bad call labour have had their full term and were toast anyway
8706865 im excited to begin the newest chapter of my career on the oklahoma staff
8706866 i have nothing but the utmost respect and admiration for sherri coale and the program she has built in norman with the championship tradition of this team and the skill of our current players i am very much looking forward to the upcoming season
8706867 her collegiate experience in this conference coupled with her professional experience both in the wnba and overseas provides her with a broad base of basketball intelligence
8706868 playing against her for four years was no fun but the respect and admiration i have for her as a competitor is second to none kendras passion for the game and her work ethic as a student athlete made her a poster child for everything that is good about intercollegiate athletics
8706869 we look forward to the channeling of those traits into her career outside the lines of the court
8706870 en una sociedad en la que rara vez dejamos nuestros tel fonos m viles fuera de nuestra vista es bastante incre ble pensar que para muchos de nosotros en cuanto nos metemos en la ducha alguien puede estar espi ndonos
8706871 con tantos modos de comunicaci n disponibles estos d as es dif cil saber d nde est tu pareja o con qui n est conversando y cu ndo
8706872 el flirteo es algo antiguo pero el hecho de que pueda quedar plasmado en el tel fono convierte a una pareja nerviosa en un esp a paranoico
8706873 si sospechas que tu pareja est haciendo algo h blalo con ella ver los mensajes de texto puede convertirse en un c rculo vicioso y puede evitarse f cilmente

8706875 stores that have experienced high levels of theft have decided to tag high value items like meat the levels of stolen meat in those stores had come down because tagging is a good deterrent we are not the only retailer to do it
8706876 nachdem die gesch ftsleitung ber den tats chlichen hintergrund der geplanten veranstaltung informiert wurde
8706877 sogar eingetragene anw lte werden auf anordnung von s amp o wieder ausgetragen
8706878 mich hat diese kaufmannstype mehrfach zu bescheissen versucht mal um 135 st ck dann um 60 die fehlten und wegen 8 cent um die er mich nachweislich bescheissen wollte mu te ich einen anwalt einschalten erst dann hat er gezahlt und zudem die fette rechnung des anwalts
8706879 auf den mehr als 500 strafgefangene im hungerstreik in deutschen gef ngnissen bezug genommen
8706880 id actually make the point that for us second hand sales is a very critical situation because people are selling multiple times intellectual property what were trying to do is build business models that are more and more online supported with additional services and additional content that you get online so people will see the value in not just getting that physical disc to play at home alone but actually playing those games online and paying for them
8706881 in our understanding of the business model we are actually giving away the rights to play and if you just pass it on pass it on pass it on that is not comparable to second hand sales in the normal physical goods area where you have physical wear out second hand cars second hand clothes second hand books theyre all physically wearing out so you have an inferior quality product but digital goods is not actually becoming inferior in quality so people passing that on is actually very challenging for us
8706882 second hand sales can be a good thing as it puts more units in the hands of consumers
8706883 the rise in costs could be even worse there is no sign of these cost pressures abating
8706884 the biggest difficulties were encountered in the anglo saxon markets which tend to like regional wines
8706885 the current problems with the exchange rate have affected these markets in particular and with them these wines from an extremely competitive niche
8706886 working at the intersection of the business cultural and philanthropy sectors bringing design thinking and design processes to a host of social and environmental challenges

8706889 its like a little house with a toilet and a bed and a couch and everything
8706890 ive told jeff that everyone should take advantage of their natural strength
8706891 with the start of school its a great time to do a commercial showing gordon smith finally coming around on global warming or the iraq war
8706892 then you show jeff on the screen looking really geeky and say something like but jeff merkley is a guy thats done his homework
8706893 he ran an inventive and fun campaign for the senate
8706894 we got to shift this dynamic we got to change this paradigm its a big challenge and one which we better bite into
8706895 esta exposi o servir para mostrar aos chilenos que temos as m mias mais antigas do mundo algo que reconhecido pela comunidade arqueol gica internacional
8706896 os corpos eram desmembrados seus rg os removidos e suas peles eram colocadas para secar depois seus ossos eram remontados com t buas e juncos para depois serem cobertos com uma pasta de barro e seus rostos eram tapados com m scaras
8706897 its an incredible show of faith by nbc and so amazingly nice to get based on the work along
8706898 we couldnt be more excited with the creative direction josh and his team are executing on chuck
8706899 this show has really hit is stride and deserves a full season commitment to carry out the producers vision for this unique series
8706900 a obra feriu o sentimento religioso de muitas pessoas que v em na cruz o s mbolo do amor de deus e da nossa salva o que merece reconhecimento e devo o religiosa
8706901 why advances long term solutions to hunger and poverty by supporting community based organizations that empower individuals and build self reliance i e offering job training education and after school programs increasing access to housing and healthcare providing microcredit and entrepreneurial opportunities teaching people to grow their own food and assisting small farmers
8706902 we dare not trust our wit for making our house pleasant to our friend so we buy ice cream
8706903 finish each day and be done with it you have done what you could some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in forget them as soon as you can tomorrow is a new day begin it well and serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered by your old nonsense

8706905 the competition between the pirates and the ninjas is so huge that battles are breaking out all over

8706907 after a couple of years on the dark side i am now a democrat
8706908 but i didnt leave the republican party i was driven out
8706909 the issue in iraq is about the timing of withdraw and by the way barack obama has been right about that all along
8706910 and incidentally there is still a war going on in afghanistan it is crucial that we win that and barack obama has been right about that all along
8706911 we got to shift this dynamic we got to change this paradigm its a big challenge and one which we better bite into
8706912 this is pretty emotional because things have finally come full circle
8706913 we got to shift this dynamic we got to change this paradigm its a big challenge and one which we better bite into
8706914 i really worked to change the culture in oregon so that politicians are accessible to the public and accountable to the public

8706922 he is in a wheelchair and looks like death so where can he bust those moves again
8706923 i cant see us playing again that would be it for me
8706924 sting thinks that but in reality we have all enjoyed the tour and so far not fallen out myself and stewart copeland dont think its quite over yet
8706925 kate middleton is a genuine fan of moss and thinks her range works well in private and public too
8706926 i have had many chats with him and he is a diamond at telling you what to do and life direction
8706927 i have promised him i am serious about my role in life and will be reporting back not from a nightclub but to him about my charity work
8706928 johnny carson did he do a hatchet job on me
8706929 its harder for anyone to be mean over there i mean sometimes you read something that is so off the wall you would like to take it in hand and it would appear the u k legal system is the place to do it
8706930 i have always secretly wanted to go on the reality tv format
8706931 you know what mate i am more nervous knowing that they are now going to be sat next to me than anything i have done on the set its unbelievable for an actor like me and i am totally thrilled
8706932 but trust me mate they can expect a rip roaring ride this is the best bond yet
8706933 police will allege the woman was greeted by a 74 year old man who entered the home and then assaulted the woman with a weapon before proceeding to the bathroom and assaulting the wheelchair bound man
8706934 as a result of the incident the man and woman both sustained multiple stab wounds to their backs heads and chests
8706935 claramente n o se trata de uma obra de arte mas de uma blasf mia e de um degradante peda o de lixo que deixou muitas pessoas indignadas

8706938 this follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value i think what were seeing is evolutionary
8706939 what were dealing with here is a use of the technology that i dont think the good people at magellan or garmin or tomtom really thought about when they were developing it
8706940 typically the gps data being used is for the purpose of contradicting defendants alibis
8706941 i think that in the last couple of years people are starting to be aware that if they have these units in their car people can keep track of you
8706942 i think its a growing public awareness the problem is that most people feel like im not doing anything wrong so who cares but i think thats the wrong way of looking at it
8706943 i met perez hilton when i was at a super bowl party in miami with a bunch of my agents
8706944 hey man ive checked out your site a handful of times and you do some pretty cool stuff on there

8706950 even if the damage from the approaching storm is fractional it could still be significant
8706951 sparse capacity means that every barrel of oil lost to the marketplace will be felt particularly as the northern hemispheres winter is just around the corner
8706952 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the gulf coast region to listen to what their local officials are advising over the course of the next few days and to take these simple steps to prepare
8706953 will not enter his plea to the indictment until the new one which he will be judged upon is finished
8706954 we will ensure that it reflects the current case law facts already established by the court and evidence collected over the past eight years
8706955 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8706956 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8706957 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8706958 i dont think theres anything to announce yet but i know that that is under discussion
8706959 it is time to establish the truth about the crimes committed before and during russias invasion of georgia
8706960 georgia continues the redeployment of its forces in the direction of south ossetia and the restoration of the combat capability of its troops
8706961 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
8706962 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
8706963 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it
8706964 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling
8706965 a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work
8706966 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products
8706967 sometimes you feel like youre in line with the soup nazi
8706968 its a really good deal to be part of the apple thing and you dont want to say anything to rock the boat no soup for you your apps are gone
8706969 the transgression has to be so egregious for someone to completely change the narrative
8706970 if something like this had happened to microsoft the long term impact would be much more for microsoft than for apple

8706975 the man who is employed for wages is as much a business man as his employer
8706976 you dont achieve or have the sort of longevity that hes had in any code in any sport without loving the challenge and without wanting to be tested and being prepared to put yourself outside your comfort zone to do that
8706977 he appears composed and hopefully he is because hes got an awful lot to offer and we just want him to bring what he does have to offer and play with confidence
8706978 were just reversing the roles i guess those blokes are doing some yards for the others for a change
8706979 hughs obviously returning from illness and then weve got the two injuries to dan vickerman and berrick barnes so timana tahu gets a start which is great for him
8706980 they have got one more shot at it in this years tri nations
8706981 if they can take it they can park the rest of the tournament and move forward a lot more positively towards their end of season tour preparations
8706982 ask yourself how youd feel in their position theres no doubt theyll be up for it
8706983 saturday still has huge significance both in terms of momentum in the tri nations but also as far as the development of our group as a whole is concerned
8706984 the large crowd that we expect is indicative of the campaign that senator obama has run from the beginning change happens from the bottom up
8706985 i have a speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys
8706986 here we were eating lunch and it was like the clouds parted and the sun was shining
8706987 the real point is does this just feed into the growing perception that what we have is one big glitzy production
8706988 but really after the crowd files out after the fireworks take place the question remains what is left and is this person ready to be president of the united states
8706989 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff

8707019 senator obama believes in a country in which opportunity is available to all americans regardless of race gender or economic status thats why he opposes these ward connerly ballot initiatives which would roll back opportunity for millions of americans and cripple efforts to break down historic barriers to the progress of qualified women and minorities
8707020 i am a strong supporter of affirmative action when properly structured so that it is not just a quota but it is acknowledging and taking into account some of the hardships and difficulties that communities of color may have experienced continue to experience and it also speaks to the value of diversity in all walks of american life we are becoming a more diverse culture and its something that has to be acknowledged

8707036 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subjected to over a long period by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8707037 when theres so many discrimination cases coming out by ethnic minorities that speaks for itself
8707038 i think that there are even further allegations against sir ian at the moment which are probably just as serious i think its an accumulation of many allegations against him
8707039 foreign countries are monitoring and keeping a close watch and waiting for a showdown

8707106 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8707107 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8707108 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8707109 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8707110 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8707111 ho pensato che se proprio devo andare allinferno tanto vale andarci in grande stile
8707112 loopholes in the system put licenses in the hands of those ill equipped to drive there is also a general apathy among consumers towards seat belts air bags and even motorcycle helmets
8707113 safety is unfortunately not a big part of the purchase decision of indian consumers our best selling small cars are typically not the safest vehicles on the road because consumers are more worried about fuel efficiency and the cost of ownership and would rather not pay for safety features such as air bags and anti lock brakes
8707114 its a continuation of this trend that eyeballs are going to other places on the internet and advertisers are recognizing that
8707115 its a step in the wrong direction for where yahoo wants things to go
8707116 i think theres only one rule that would make it fair for everybody and that would be to ban greg furlong

8707123 i guess youve got to be patient and know when to race and when to take your time take care of your car
8707124 i definitely think the tires have made a huge change from past years
8707125 we all have the same tire so it puts everybody in the same boat
8707126 i think its anybodys race there have been several different winners this year
8707127 these guys are great drivers and they could win it at any time
8707128 i truly think there are 15 to 20 guys who could win and nobody would be surprised
8707129 i think with the changes theyve made its shown the older cars can compete
8707130 with the racing this year and how close its been i think the track has done a lot of good things
8707131 on any given night you couldnt predict who was going to win
8707132 its been very very close i see the division getting stronger but people have to want to race
8707133 its extraordinary its an only in america kind of story this in many respects is emblematic of martin luther kings speech
8707134 the dmca was intended to facilitate the growth of electronic commerce not squelch it
8707135 we are routinely approached by writers and filmmakers interested in telling the facebook story or the stories of the more than 100 million people who use facebook to share and make the world more open and connected
8707136 at this point we have not agreed to cooperate with any film project but we are flattered by the interest

8707154 a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of u s president
8707155 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8707156 i do not think there is unanimous appetite for it imposing sanctions on russia
8707157 that is a sick imagination and probably that applies to sanctions as well i think it is a demonstration of complete confusion
8707158 it that was the case then the recent events could have a american domestic political dimension
8707159 if that is true if that is confirmed then thats really bad its very dangerous and a mistaken policy
8707160 to rely exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and prevents finding a comprehensive resolution of local conflicts
8707161 the sco states express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the south ossetian issue and urge the sides to solve existing problems peacefully through dialogue and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks
8707162 we also have approximately 200 to 300 that were previously on layoff
8707163 so tomorrow if theres a need for 20 more employees theyre calling them
8707164 with our volumes being down theres obviously going to be some idle employees in our manufacturing plants
8707165 by being creative with our work force and how were operating aggressively managing our costs and overhead
8707166 our existing contracts are in place the volumes of what they are though have been reduced as demand has slowed
8707167 one of the key reasons that weve probably managed quite well compared to our competitors and other manufacturers is that we have strategically diversified not only in our customers but in our products
8707168 we sent him to best club in the country look at how many thousand make trial cuts i mean theyre scooping the only the cream at the top
8707169 once michael was considered of olympic calibre it caused a bit of turmoil at home
8707170 its here today gone tomorrow i have to go back to my mothers lesson in valuing each day and making the best of it you dont know whats going to happen next
8707171 to understand that all people are different come from different walks of life and some just dont know how to be nice
8707172 this bully acting as if they were long time friends asked michael if he remembered him to which michael replied he didnt
8707173 he wasnt going to give that bully the satisfaction of knowing that he did in fact remember him and all the torment he received by his hand
8707174 michael youre a freshman was she your friend before sydney
8707175 you dont want him to get used i too get approached by people who say they know me and i dont know them i meet people who are excited by michael and i ask them how many swim meets theyve been to he gets so caught up with people like on facebook how many of those people does he really know there are people who havent been around for years and are all of a sudden cropping up now that michael is world famous
8707176 we know the need is real people are calling and its not just poor people who are calling people cant afford the homes they have today due to some of the increases theres a lot of anxiety out there
8707177 this bridge will be in place for the duration of a two to three year period until the new bridge is finished with design all the permits are in place and the right of way has been acquired the new bridge will be downstream from this one just a bit that was the original plan

8707182 people talk about a technical recession even if thats true i dont think its a real recession
8707183 somebody said a recession is when people start losing their jobs and when your neighbour loses his job there are job losses but overall employment is pretty stable
8707184 look im not trying to sugarcoat this i said a year ago and i said as we moved into the new year that 2008 would be a year of significantly slower economic growth because of the circumstances we have in the global economy and in the american economy
8707185 at the same time i believe the fundamentals of canada are strong will get us through this slow growth and if we make the right policy choices we will actually emerge from it with a very strong economy

8707215 joe is a big character and i think that was evident with his antics in the shoot out i dont know what the referee said to him while it was going on but it certainly worked
8707216 he is an excellent goalkeeper though and i was impressed with him before i arrived at the club he is still very young but he has made a real impact and tonight he delivered yet again

8707232 the credit risk analysis of these ulbs has thrown up some interesting findings for example most ratings in the investment grade are significantly higher than the credit risk profiles of the respective state governments this means the ratings of ulbs are not constrained by state government ratings unless there is a heavy dependence on discretionary ad hoc government grants

8707247 muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche
8707248 quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia y amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las armas de fuego en contra de los comuneros mapuches
8707249 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos
8707250 ante el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios
8707251 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8707252 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8707253 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8707254 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8707255 ive not met one premiership director of rugby who would wish these laws upon the game
8707256 if youre off your feet at the breakdown youll be out of the game
8707257 the only time there can be a true contest for the ball is when a player is on his feet
8707258 there will be more kicking and not much rugby played in the middle third of the field
8707259 im not going to go for someone when im up 6 2 6 2 5 2 it was a bad miss but a miss that i hit very hard i was really excited about the way i was playing and to end it like that was a little i guess disappointing i can definitely understand where hes coming from if i were in the same situation id probably be momentarily p off too it is what it is
8707260 i think ill probably try to find him here in the next couple of days and at least tell him that it wasnt my intention it was my intention to hit it hard but its a serve i rarely hit serving flat to the body its unfortunate but it happens weve always gotten along pretty well im sure it will be fine but i definitely will seek him out and try to talk to him
8707261 the match was over and i was a little bit disappointed at the way he served on that point if it was a mistake then it was the biggest mistake of his life
8707262 when he goes on the t its right on the t
8707263 i know that patrick is more than busy with being the davis cup captain and everything but i figured that i wanted to work with someone who knew my game knew my personality and so i think it was pretty obvious who would be the best fit to help me out for this just this tournament
8707264 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8707265 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
8707266 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
8707267 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
8707268 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8707269 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche

8707272 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8707273 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche
8707274 el pueblo mapuche tiene la amplia disposici n para el di logo en la medida que el derecho a la autodeterminaci n el autogobierno mapuche y el territorio sean los ejes fundamentales del di logo
8707275 cesen los allanamientos y la militarizaci n de las comunidades mapuche
8707276 los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche
8707277 el ministerio del interior presente las debidas querellas criminales en contra del gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n por su participaci n en la apolog a a la violencia tales acciones criminales deben presentarse al m s breve plazo de lo contrario ser n las comunidades que concurrir n al tribunal

8707287 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad
8707288 el conflicto no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
8707289 el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas

8707292 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece
8707293 neruda sol a viajar desde temuco a puerto saavedra pues all un colono de apellido winter le prestaba libros en ese tiempo el poeta escribi sus primeras obras los borradores de los veinte poemas de amor pero en todos ellos no hay un solo indio neruda no los vio y eso que en puerto saavedra no hay m s que arena olas y mapuches
8707294 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
8707295 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
8707296 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones
8707297 no hay museo m s chic en chile que el museo de arte precolombino

8707302 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
8707303 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad
8707304 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
8707305 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
8707306 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
8707307 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8707308 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8707309 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

8707315 el agua dada la trascendencia que tiene para la vida humana el agua realmente est dentro de la categor a de los derechos humanos
8707316 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo
8707317 ticamente es para nosotros inaceptable sea el proyecto en s mismo que planea construir cinco mega centrales en ays n y consideramos inaceptable la postura del estado frente a estas situaciones que se han ido dando con incluso apoyos p blicos de algunos ministros previo a la presentaci n del proyecto de impacto ambiental
8707318 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
8707319 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n

8707344 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches

8707379 ive put a green down at home which is like concrete and we have had almost as much rain as theyve had here
8707380 they really do need to dig them up and put in the right kind of construction underneath if you are going to build a course in a scottish valley you must expect rain so rain is not an excuse for having bad greens im afraid
8707381 this is no good for the sponsors its no good for the tour and its no good for gleneagles which is fabulous

8707384 he is now doing a lot of things i was asking him to like being much more aggressive and stop hitting so many drop shots stop playing what i call possum tennis
8707385 if he plays more like that then great things are going to happen because he has great talent
8707386 for a young guy he appears older than he is because he is very driven and is pretty reserved
8707387 youre joking it is an honour to be considered to be thought of as someone who other people can look up to to be a part of encouraging young people into sport has to be an honour i dont feel it is a responsibility it is an honour i hope to inspire and get people involved in sport at a young age i didnt expect to go to beijing and win gold medals i want young people to see that the underdog can come out and win against the odds it came from hard work not from nowhere i get up and swim at 5am every morning
8707388 we have all seen those pictures of vicky pendleton posing nude on a bike and she looked absolutely stunning you can be sporty sexy and feminine
8707389 most sportswomen have great figures we need to reinforce that get the message across having said that i dont think sport should be forced on young women it has to be a choice
8707390 people say i came from nowhere to get my gold medals
8707391 they didnt see the last seven years of sacrifice it may have been my first games because i missed out on the commonwealth games two years ago through injury but
8707392 although weve signed a lot of players this summer weve still got only a 21 man squad really and well lose a lot of that to the internationals next week weve not got players who play for england but so many go all around the world when these international weeks come up it takes a lot away from our training and preparation

8707400 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university why is my wife glenys the first woman in her family in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because all our predecessors were thick
8707401 i started thinking as i was coming over here why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright
8707402 those people who could sing and play and recite and write poetry those people who could make wonderful beautiful things with their hands those people who could dream dreams see visions why didnt they get it was it because they were weak those people who could work eight hours underground and then come up and play football weak
8707403 those same people who read poetry and wrote poetry and taught me how to sing verse is it because they didnt work hard my ancestors who worked in the coal mines of northeast pennsylvania and would come up after 12 hours and play football for four hours
8707404 so what if i didnt attribute it to kinnock i cant quite understand this if i was making up who i was then thats one thing
8707405 because there was no platform upon which they could stand
8707406 grew up well polished by gentlemanly pursuits he would ride to the hounds drive fast fly airplanes he knew good clothes fine horses the newest dance steps
8707407 he pissed away his fortune and joe and his siblings grew up in a decidedly and proudly working class catholic home
8707408 its a noble bird because it has good family values they stay together for 30 years
8707409 they lay one egg each year they put their excrement in one place they hide their excrement they flap their wings very hard and they work like hell

8707710 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational
8707711 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice

8707718 you do some tweaking at a new school but quite honestly if you have good personnel you dont have to tweak
8707719 they can do whatever you ask them to do the nature of things is youre going to try to do what it takes to win
8707720 you better match their intensity because theyre going to come in here to play hard and not just to collect a check
8707721 he built us our own private locker room our own private training room and equipment room so we feel right at home
8707722 weve always been of the mindset that you have to play the guy whos going to give you the best opportunity to win
8707723 wilson is a very confident young man hes got a strong arm and hopefully he will lead us to victory
8707724 you look at some of the things hes doing today he did those back in the 80s
8707725 he has a system but like every coach you change and you tweak this and that he understands what he wants to do and he understands when you counter what his counter is going to be
8707726 i heard somebody say the other day and i think its really true anybody can win the opening game
8707727 thats when you make most of your mistakes and typically those are magnified on the road
8707728 weve enjoyed the underdog role weve enjoyed being under the radar
8707729 weve been able to sneak up on some people i dont think thats going to happen anymore baylor would love to knock off a ranked team this is new territory for us but i feel our kids are handling it well
8707730 east carolina is for real we know how good they are up front defensively we couldnt get our running attack going against them last year
8707731 its in the best interests of virginia tech football for taylor to have three more years of eligibility deciding on a quarterback gives our team a direction and it is full speed ahead
8707732 and when you play the marquee team in college football which usc has certainly earned the right to be it puts an added level of challenge and interest on the game for our team
8707733 seldom do you ever have an opener against a team thats currently ranked as no 3 and arguably at this stage is as good as anybody so it probably tightens the focus on every little detail as far as the players are concerned everybody recognizes the need to get our game as finely tuned as possible
8707734 they wont come in here and be in awe i can tell you that theyve been in big games before they beat navy last year a good navy team so we know what were in for
8707735 jordan had a better spring practice and a better fall
8707736 we base that decision on things like passing stats mental errors scoring drives in scrimmages big plays and interceptions
8707737 you try to pride your players on the idea that you disregard the name of the opponent
8707738 and watch the tape and watch the players and how they play and as soon as you do you start to appreciate what theyre capable of doing
8707739 its not going to be a quick fix its not going to be a one year deal or a two year thing therere still going to be growing pains this year were going to take some lumps and learn some lessons if we can avoid injuries it gives us a chance to get better
8707740 i think its because of this group of kids theyve worked so hard and thats why the butterflies are maybe a little bigger ive had a lot of opening days and i think there have always been butterflies whether i was a head coach or an assistant
8707741 ive never been with this group of young men before on game day so theres a little uncertainty about how they will respond any nervousness i feel is just in the hopes that they do well
8707742 when youre at duke in our situation everybody is a quality opponent so thats not an issue
8707743 all you have to do is put on a projector to see james madison and the players see exactly what were talking about they dont take anybody for granted our problem is the other way having enough confidence to play
8707744 hes done a nice job in practice and it will be real telling when the lights are on how he responds
8707745 i think hell handle it well hes mobile he gets out of the bad spots he can run and get out on the edge were going to move the quarterback around the pocket a lot more than we did with matt because thats one of chris strengths
8707746 we want to see his decision making and how he manages the game
8707747 thats what were asking him to do this season manage the game manage the offense stay within the parameters of what weve taught you and i think hell be fine if he starts going off course and doing his own thing i think well have some problems
8707748 the atmosphere seems to be of a bowl and i know tickets cost about the same as a bowl and theyre hard to get
8707749 you have to play at a higher level of efficiency
8707750 if we were playing a lesser opponent you wouldnt have to be as sharp mentally you could have some busted assignments a turnover or two and probably still win the game in a game like this you cant you have to take high level of concentration into the game

8707948 this is a historic decision for womens rights not just in mexico city not even just in mexico but for women all over latin america
8707949 the best legitimization of the law can be seen in society itself the women who requested its enforcement from the day after it was issued and who continue demanding care in public hospitals for the first time in our history the country is responding to the actual circumstances that motivate women to resort to abortion reasons that do not need the authorization of a prosecutor a judge or a physician regardless of the law women make choices conscientiously responsibly and freely
8707950 a freedom that is recognized and exercised can never again be undermined except in a context of authoritarian regression

8707962 the world bank report suggests that if this continues a third of the worlds poor people will live in sub saharan africa by 2015

8707974 i think sooner or later youre going to see lindsay right back up on top where she belongs and shes going to turn around and say dad you were right all along
8707975 she dated guys her whole life she has a relationship with sam and its a friendship because shes been hurt by so many guys in the past maybe she kind of walked away and found solace and companionship in a girl

8707977 but thats between lindsay and god and samantha and god
8707978 if dina was on the right page and doing the right thing as a mother and didnt play two sides of the coin like she does then things would be much better for lindsay

8708033 here we were eating lunch and it was like the clouds parted and the sun was shining
8708034 the real point is does this just feed into the growing perception that what we have is one big glitzy production
8708035 but really after the crowd files out after the fireworks take place the question remains what is left and is this person ready to be president of the united states
8708036 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8708037 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8708038 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8708039 i dont think theres anything to announce yet but i know that that is under discussion
8708040 it is time to establish the truth about the crimes committed before and during russias invasion of georgia
8708041 georgia continues the redeployment of its forces in the direction of south ossetia and the restoration of the combat capability of its troops
8708042 even if the damage from the approaching storm is fractional it could still be significant
8708043 sparse capacity means that every barrel of oil lost to the marketplace will be felt particularly as the northern hemispheres winter is just around the corner
8708044 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the gulf coast region to listen to what their local officials are advising over the course of the next few days and to take these simple steps to prepare
8708045 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
8708046 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
8708047 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it
8708048 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling
8708049 a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work
8708050 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products
8708051 sometimes you feel like youre in line with the soup nazi
8708052 its a really good deal to be part of the apple thing and you dont want to say anything to rock the boat no soup for you your apps are gone
8708053 the transgression has to be so egregious for someone to completely change the narrative
8708054 if something like this had happened to microsoft the long term impact would be much more for microsoft than for apple
8708055 motion to suspend the rules for emergency order on petitioners motion to issue writ of mandamus pending review and decision of the supreme court of the united states and motion for such relief
8708056 petitioners motion for relief does not seek to preserve the status quo pendent lite in the supreme court of the united states rather it seeks on an emergency basis and purportedly only pending a ruling from the supreme court precisely the relief sought in the petition on the merits which this court denied in its order of august 26 petitioners have provided neither rationale nor legal authority for granting pending appeal the very relief already denied by the court particularly where that relief would deny a candidate a place on the ballot and therefore require a new election if petitioners are unsuccessful on the merits
8708057 hes just a dude in a suit hes not like superman

8708059 im two issues done and i got one issue to do walter is almost on the last page of issue one in terms of artwork
8708060 at the end of the day the movie batman has always been very separate and distinct from the comic book batman and i think you can definitely drive yourself crazy thinking do i really want to touch batman after the dark knight but that cant stop people from writing batman on a regular basis it didnt feel intimidating at that point i would be stupid not to do it just based on the fact that the dark knight was so successful
8708061 thankfully i finished the first two issues before the dark knight came out laughs
8708062 errh well in the blogosphere we are free to walk hike stroll wander roam and ramble as much as we want at any time anywhere and any how we want it without the blogospolice raising a finger a blogger without a niche

8708085 mas mais recentemente entre 1985 e 2006 essas rela es entram num movimento de intensidade vari vel e cont nuo com per odos de ambival ncias e incertezas de acentuado decl nio entre as d cadas de 1980 e 1990 esbo ando recupera o nesta virada de s culo
8708086 se ajusta s varia es observadas no plano internacional e na pr pria agenda diplom tica brasileira
8708087 a constru o de uma pol tica africana embasada na premissa de la os maternos pressup e uma vis o distorcida da pr pria frica em que o brasil por meio de um discurso pretensamente progressista julga se capaz de ajudar os pa ses africanos promovendo uma pol tica mission ria
8708088 constata se que o processo de formula o da pol tica externa para o continente ainda desprovido de embasamento societ rio
8708089 inexistem mecanismos de articula o e canais fluidos de comunica o entre os dois segmentos o que compromete a participa o mais ampla de setores e atores sociais como o caso do setor privado que pela pol tica diplom tica insular se mant m margem dos processos negociadores
8708090 a aproxima o com o continente africano um dos mais acertados desdobramentos recentes da pol tica externa brasileira avaliada superficialmente a estrat gia tem atra do cr ticas uma vez que pode parecer paradoxal um pa s em desenvolvimento como o brasil incrementar seus esfor os diplom ticos em parceiros pobres com relativamente pouca influ ncia no contexto geopol tico global e peso ainda baixo na balan a comercial brasileira
8708091 preciso ir al m da superf cie e avaliar essa estrat gia nos movimentos de internacionaliza o de empresas brasileiras a frica um dos territ rios naturalmente adequados de investimentos em setores em que empresas brasileiras j s o muito competitivas
8708092 as potencialidades do com rcio brasil frica existem pois ainda que se observe a debilidade da situa o econ mica de muitos pa ses h v rias economias africanas que desde 1994 v m conseguindo taxas anuais de crescimento acima de 10 o que justifica maior interesse e agressividade de empresas brasileiras
8708093 h uma frica em crescente internacionaliza o e nada marginal e que est no centro de uma concorr ncia fort ssima de interesses e interessados de todas as partes do globo em especial a china e mais recentemente os eua
8708094 n o sejamos por m ing nuos bvio que a frica outra fronteira do capitalismo o faroeste de hoje h ali claro uma luta de gigantes iniciada pela china em 1989 com a crise da paz celestial que isolou o pa s e obrigou o primeiro ministro li peng a se aproximar do continente africano de onde n o partiram cr ticas aos incidentes pol ticos chineses
8708095 mas h um artigo recente vindo dos eua de 2006 escrito por um professor de harvard e chester crooker ex subsecret rio americano de estado para a frica
8708096 os resultados mais recentes mostram que a galactose pode proteger contra a destrui o da cartilagem que reveste os ossos
8708097 ainda n o existe nenhuma medica o que impe a a progress o da artrose
8708098 pensei em criar uma empresa para fazer os testes pr cl nicos mas n o tenho expertise nem esse meu projeto de vida
8708099 eu pretendia incentivar o uso sustent vel das sementes e colaborar com a conserva o do cerrado
8708100 para explorar as sementes as rvores teriam de ser preservadas
8708101 queremos intensificar em quantidade e qualidade a contribui o dos pesquisadores de s o paulo no avan o do conhecimento sobre as mudan as clim ticas e temos expectativa de que o programa propicie a produ o de mais estudos em temas nos quais o brasil tenha interesse espec fico

8708103 temos uma ind stria mais moderna que a de outros pa ses que se estabeleceu num momento em que j havia recursos tecnol gicos para poluir menos nossos grandes problemas concentram se em transporte e em gera o de energia
8708104 mesmo nos estados unidos que t m uma postura reacion ria estados munic pios e empresas tomaram decis es para controlar as emiss es de gases estufa na contram o de washington porque a base da sociedade participa do processo de compreens o dos efeitos do aquecimento global
8708105 que os pesquisadores se lancem agora com afinco a seus estudos para que no futuro esses infelizes a quem cabe tomar decis es espinhosas felizmente n o sou mais um deles possam decidir com base em dados mais confi veis
8708106 have you been watching the convention its such garbage remember when it used to be fun youd have gavel to gavel coverage youd get to watch the platform fight the roll call it was great fun and you really got to see these people in action its all so scripted and polished and safe now
8708107 it doesnt sound like up til now there has been much worth watching besides the hissy fits and adolescent dramatics of keith olbermann and chris matthews
8708108 i used to love chris matthews and now hes just this sniveling little crankpot and olbermann is unhinged theyre eating each other over there with scarborough and schuster taking tabs on wholl emerge on top and fighting for scraps and theyre so in the tank for obama theyre not even trying to hide it any more ive never seen anything like it
8708109 al qaeda attacks us or our interests about every 18 months and we ignore it until they get so emboldened that they figure they can attack us on our soil
8708110 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8708111 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured
8708112 through the introduction of tomtom live services we are also evolving from a pure pnd manufacturer to a provider of state of the art routing information
8708113 we believe that through those innovations we can enhance the lives of millions
8708114 what were trying to do is build business models that are more and more online supported with additional services and additional content that you get online so people will see the value in not just getting that physical disc to play at home alone but actually playing those games online and paying for them
8708115 in our understanding of the business model we are actually giving away the rights to play and if you just pass it on pass it on pass it on that is not comparable to second hand sales in the normal physical goods area where you have physical wear out second hand cars second hand clothes second hand books theyre all physically wearing out so you have an inferior quality product
8708116 but digital goods is not actually becoming inferior in quality so people passing that on is actually very challenging for us
8708117 however the advice being given to sundin is to avoid using the term
8708118 he knows that once you stop at this age getting going again at the same level is close to impossible
8708119 reading is inherently private hence the reader at npr when we all know he should be out there promoting his excellent book why we hate us says we as a nation regardless of our political affiliations or which way were voting should feel proud tonight to watch an african american be declared the official presidential nominee of a major political party
8708120 its because of this one thing that that is happening or not happening

8708129 androgyny mong adds or lets just say it straight up
8708130 there are songs that can provide comfort from the literal and metaphorical storms in your life joelle jacinto lists ten of the songs that do that for her
8708131 sometime in mid june my friend kathy put together a playlist for her friends i listened to it and felt embraced comforted as if it were raining outside and she provided me warmth i told her it sounded like a playlist for healing and she admitted that it was ive been broken before by relationships by lost career opportunities by sprained ankles at the height of my dance career and ive been healed by music
8708132 dong abay ely buendia vin dancel owel alvero and aldus santos take turns in a slippery show and tell how are these damn songs made
8708133 there is nothing more elusive than the artistic process often being asked to speak of ones craft is like being asked to describe the sun the stars or the wind youd be right but youd be terribly mistaken as well

8708137 the gas and the fuel for cars has always been a problem for iraqis inside iraq the irony that iraq has one of the worlds largest reservoirs of oil is not lost on iraqis
8708138 were there any questions from the audience then youd know what they want to hear
8708139 to a reasonable suspicion that his possession is for a purpose connected with the commission preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism
8708140 theres one label we are certainly going to go with at this point
8708141 but i dont think im allowed to disclose that right now
8708142 it is the first fossil of a pregnant turtle found in the world and its only the second fossil of an animal found in the world thats pregnant
8708143 its a very primitive turtle and its basically an ancestor of modern turtles so we can look at characteristics of the eggs and nests and we can learn about the evolution of these traits in turtles today
8708144 the turtle was prepared at the royal tyrrell museum so basically the fossil was removed from the rock so that probably took about a year
8708145 last year we finally finished the preparation of the turtle nest so i wanted to publish them together in a single paper so thats why its out now
8708146 although it is relatively rare to find the eggs and babies of extinct animals it is even rarer to find them inside the body of the mother
8708147 the turtle specimen was partly broken when it was first discovered it is this fortuitous break that revealed that the fossil was a mother
8708148 the odds of actually of finding an animal that died and was fossilized at the time it was basically laying its eggs is basically one in a million so when you find something like that you know youve found something that is unique
8708149 absolutely thats why we keep going back every summer in the hope that you actually find something new that was not known before
8708150 our whole purpose is to make sure the unit is as safe as possible
8708151 we know we could be the patient who gets the blood
8708152 a trauma arises or somebody gets into difficulty post surgery or a baby is born and needs transfusion support that can happen at any time day or night
8708153 something that you thought was not curable and not treatable you may be able to actually change
8708154 it will certainly encourage lots of researchers to use dopamine drugs in clinical trials
8708155 its not all of it but its a big chunk of it
8708156 you think oh my god mentally challenged sheltered work environment for the rest of their lives are they going to get married can they go to school can they take care of themselves
8708157 all those images you have of your hopes and aspirations theyre gone its like a death
8708158 dopamine is still being released in patients dopamine still binds to the receptor but nothing is going on after that
8708159 we are very pleased to receive this sizeable follow on solar order in the rapidly growing asia pacific region which further demonstrates the increasing acceptance we are seeing for our solar products from our worldwide base of solar customers we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our marketing pipeline and opportunities to grow our solar business into fiscal 2009

8708162 none of us can provide a cast iron guarantee that salmonella saintpaul will not re emerge
8708163 is an important indication that this particular outbreak is over
8708164 we continue to believe that association could reflect real contamination early on
8708165 it is information that is more restricted in time and does not have confirmatory laboratory findings behind it
8708166 this tragedy we are living in mexico city is going to spread to other states
8708167 it opens the road for all of latin america to start visualizing legal paths to abortion
8708168 its not up to the supreme court to legalize or criminalize abortion
8708169 i offered those women free prenatal checkups and a free birth and then i told them they could wring the childs neck themselves
8708170 they are just encouraging women to be dirty and loose
8708171 the justices decision is only going to spread more irresponsible behavior
8708172 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8708173 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8708174 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing
8708175 were glad to see were in the forecast path because they never get it right this far out
8708176 i say that slightly tongue in cheek but its true
8708177 today were announcing the launch of ubiquity a mozilla labs experiment into connecting the web with language in an attempt to find new user interfaces that could make it possible for everyone to do common web tasks more quickly and easily
8708178 too often and for too long we have overstated the inconvenience of warfarin and exaggerated its risks ignoring convincing evidence of its effectiveness in practice
8708179 reminds us of the perils of discounting the benefits of warfarin
8708180 potentially preventable strokes in high risk patients with atrial fibrillation who are not adequately anticoagulated
8708181 the medical community once thought that while the body benefited from good health choices very little could be done to help regenerate the brain we now know that the brain is very resilient and it is possible to keep the brain sharp and agile as one grows older
8708182 im the person you call when you have more questions than answers about your mothers or fathers care
8708183 such an event dangerously threatens our religious feelings it is not appropriate to hold it during the ramadan
8708184 this is the festival of arts and culture and there are many believers in our population as well
8708185 the lack of sexual freedom has made people in the region very prone to war mongering and crimes
8708186 this is a traditional society in which most people still do not accept the existence of different sexualities or identities
8708187 sadly we frequently see patients admitted to a hospital with a devastating stroke who are known to have atrial fibrillation yet were either not taking warfarin or were taking a dose that is not therapeutic
8708188 too often and for too long we have overstated the inconvenience of warfarin and exaggerated its risks ignoring convincing evidence of its effectiveness in practice
8708189 lyon will be a hurdle to overcome fiorentina has its attraction because of luca toni it will no doubt be a very exciting affair
8708190 this is a group no one should underestimate but the match against fiorentina will be delicacy for luca toni and our fans
8708191 i would not have preferred to play against a big club like chelsea manchester or arsenal its good to play lyon from my own experience i know what they are like
8708192 i would be a liar if i said we could not solve this task
8708193 we are happy even if the group does not appear spectacular on the first view it is interesting
8708194 inter milan is a big challenge and the greeks can be very hard to beat
8708195 our fans will experience a first against famagusta so the group is not without its attractions
8708196 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8708197 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08
8708198 the diaper opened and the baby fell to the ground but at a much slower speed
8708199 the diaper obviously lessened the impact of the fall and saved the babys life
8708200 he could also have been killed by one of the spikes
8708201 well i have met on one occasion with speaker pelosi before she was speaker pelosi
8708202 we held the same target group with the singstar karaoke game but perhaps we neglected to pursue that avenue
8708203 playstation games are rather designed for those who play a lot although its a different strategy it pays off we currently have a production bottleneck with the playstation 3 consumers are purchasing our playstation 3 video game consoles faster than we can produce them
8708204 the wii is not succeeding at our expense it is not hurting us we decided years ago to build a game console that offers much greater functionality
8708205 they are going to be fantastic games the rivalry is there between scotland and england we played against them a couple of years ago and got a victory it promises to be a great atmosphere in both games
8708206 our home form is very good its just our away form that has been very poor if we can get that right it will go a long way to getting through to the next round
8708207 we dont have to travel far and the fixtures have fallen nicely weve got a home game against villarreal inbetween the games against liverpool and chelsea
8708208 i remember the last game at celtic distinctly they beat us to qualify and the atmosphere from their fans was unbelievable they will be two huge games
8708209 its a big one we seem to make a habit of drawing the european champions
8708210 weve had man utd ac milan and barcelona three years in a row theres no free passes in europe but its great for the fans
8708211 wouldnt it be fabulous if we could get through and meet united later on in the competition
8708212 with our spanish contingent that will be a couple of very big games and there will be a lot of attention focused on those
8708213 theyve got some very good players and if theres one team in the last pot we didnt want to sign it was them
8708214 we know all of the teams quite well for different reasons
8708215 if you come down to the training ground you will see the boys are totally focused on the champions league
8708216 we have always been the bridesmaids weve been to four semi finals and a final we want to go one better this year
8708217 its an interesting draw a bit of mixed bag the romanian team is interesting because im not aware of them well have to do our homework
8708218 one of the issues for arsene is the distances we have to travel
8708219 the draw is the draw theres nothing to do about it
8708220 even after seeing the teams we will play you dont know if it will be an easy or difficult first phase
8708221 our first objective is to get to the next phase the second is to try to do so as group b winners
8708222 of course were really motivated and confident we want to start playing the champions league as soon as possible
8708223 for us its great to be welcomed back to the champions league with a classic encounter against real madrid
8708224 but theres also zenit who represent the progression of east european teams our players need to remember that theyre playing at the highest level and that juve are back
8708225 it seems like a good group to me certainly an interesting one
8708226 that team has something extra however weve attained a certain level over the last few years and i think thats something the players should cherish like a treasure
8708227 voices of alzheimers disease summary report on the nationwide town hall meetings for people with early stage dementia
8708228 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8708229 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8708230 current drugs given to people with lewy body and parkinsons disease simply treat the symptoms this model is the first platform to understand how the brain cell deterioration takes place we will use this model to identify targets for new drugs to slow or prevent the disease
8708231 the important thing is making a good start we took one point from the first three games last season and weve got to do better
8708232 there are no easy games you just take it as it comes we are just delighted to be in it
8708233 we know it wont be easy but we know liverpool from p laying them last year that could be an advantage for us but also for them
8708234 romanian football has come on a lot and fiorentina were semi finalists in last seasons uefa cup and had a good season in italy well have to get points pretty much everywhere
8708235 we are experiencing the first episode in history of reverse coupling in which the rest of the world pulls the u s forward rather than the opposite
8708236 the improvement in trade balance has accounted for the totality of u s economic growth over the three quarters

8708248 john mccain supported the rescinding of martin luther king day while sending his own money to terrorists in nicaragua

8708508 doctrine is not an affair of the tongue but of the life is not apprehended by the intellect and memory merely like other branches of learning but is received only when it possesses the whole soul and finds its seat and habitation in the inmost recesses of the heart but it must be transfused into the breast and pass into the conduct and so transform us into itself as not to prove unfruitful

8708560 what is the greatest miracle that god can do for us some would call the healing of the body gods greatest miracle while others would vote for the raising of the dead however i think that the greatest miracle of all is the salvation of a lost sinner why because salvation costs the greatest price it produces the greatest results and it brings the greatest glory to god the bible exposition commentary vol 1 443

8708604 a 2008 objective for norsat is to establish a foothold in the global maritime satellite communication market and this strategic partnership is a key first step
8708605 navisystem is a leading developer of maritime satellite terminals making its product offering a natural addition to our portfolio of satellite systems we look forward to working with navisystem to further expand our product suite in an effort to become a strong player in the worldwide maritime satellite communication market
8708606 partnering with norsat expands our geographic reach enabling us to better capitalize on the global demand for maritime satellite communication systems
8708607 by leveraging norsats strong brand and leadership position in the portable satellite terminal industry we believe we will be well positioned to effectively penetrate the north american market
8708608 the information provided by the gis will allow us to keep up to date and accurate records among various departments basically all of our utilities are on the mapping system which provides easy access to accurate data
8708609 the benefit is in knowing where everything is and how it all interrelates
8708610 now we have this information readily accessible to everyone in the city to use and view it is not just in someones head gis is all about the information and the ability to access it
8708611 the water and sewer mapping is about 95 percent done
8708612 that means we have gis positions on all of the sewer manhole covers pipes and grinder pumps as well as the water valves backflows and fire hydrants we are working on the meters and storm water features as well
8708613 before with all of the growth occurring in the city the maps in the city police cars were not kept completely up to date
8708614 it is very important for emergency services to know exactly where they are going and be able to track distances with the gis they can calculate the exact footage of distances between points within seconds they can access an accurate picture of the city the system enables us to update addresses and street center lines in house as soon as a plat is finalized
8708615 part of our ultimate goal is to have one asset management database and we will be proposing that soon
8708616 input wise there is still a bit left to do but it is an ongoing process the new city web site will make all of this information as easy to access as possible for everyone in the city most importantly we now have a way to make institutional knowledge available for everyone to use in making plans and decisions

8708621 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition we dont know and so i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins human life begins
8708622 and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy but it is also true that god has given us a free will and a responsibility to answer for our actions
8708623 ardent practicing catholics will quickly learn from the historical record that from apostolic times the christian tradition overwhelmingly held that abortion was grievously evil
8708624 some of the early fathers held that abortion was homicide others that it was tantamount to homicide and various scholars theorized about when and how the unborn child might be animated or ensouled but none diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself
8708625 it is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it catholics who make excuses for it whether theyre famous or not fool only themselves and abuse the fidelity of those catholics who do sincerely seek to follow the gospel and live their catholic faith
8708626 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable

8708652 hes a great american and a great and dear friend and i rely on him and i have for many years
8708653 doing the speech at mile high is an important point for our campaign its symbolic of how sen obama won the nomination it will show how obama wants to involve people who are not usually involved in the political process

8708659 this schedule will tell us where we stand from the first game
8708660 to open the season by taking on a mountain west opponent and then turn around and face three straight postseason teams is going to be tough but i am sure our team will be up for the challenge we have a great mix of opponents early on which will help our team prepare for the conference schedule which will be difficult as usual
8708661 this is quite an ambitious schedule especially the away and neutral court games with a team as youthful and inexperienced as ours
8708662 the old spice classic and games at texas tech and tcu will provide an early challenge the good news is that those two teams tt and tcu return to charles koch arena next season
8708663 our home schedule this season is also one that is full of teams that have had some degrees of success such as gardner webb winning at kentucky and centenary defeating texas tech last year

8708745 mccain may be good enough to go off to vietnam and get himself tortured good for him but he just aint smart enough to be president
8708746 it seems to me that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign

8708755 we want to be respectful of events inside the convention center for example if we were lowering the roof today and there were an event over there im betting the people would probably want to walk out of their event come over and watch the roof
8708756 what were trying to do is get a sense of whats going on in the city over those two weeks
8708757 again and again john mccain was wrong barack obama was right
8708758 well obviously i didnt want to scare her unnecessarily but then i weighed out the options if something wasnt wrong then no real harm was done if something was wrong then i really had no option so obviously i had to tell her really
8708759 i suppose if thats how they feel then thats what i am to them i think anybody in my situation would have done the same thing if theyd known what i knew and had the opportunity to say it so i suppose im a hero in a certain sense but in another sense i think im just you know rather normal and i care about people

8708768 with the world economy slowing we shouldnt expect exports to add nearly as much to growth
8708769 the question is while the economy apparently expanded strongly during the spring what does this mean for the second half of the year
8708770 although the increase in real gdp in the second quarter was a bit faster than anticipated at the time of the june meeting
8708771 the labor market continued to weaken significantly financial conditions remained unfavorable consumer and business confidence was downbeat and manufacturing activity was contracting

8708941 ten years ago i was teaching in the new york city school system making 28 000 a year and on the verge of being evicted from my apartment i threw my first party falling out of the garden of eden it was such a huge success theatrically erotically financially for me that my friends asked me to host more erotic parties thats how one leg up got started
8708942 a lot of the people who attend them are vultures
8708943 when the clothes come off so do the job the status the pretensions
8708944 women need to feel safe to explore fantasy and expand their boundaries in a private setting
8708945 the sense of anticipation leading up to our events and the costumes the theatrical elements create an atmosphere of sensual and luxurious eroticism that appeals to women they want to go to a party where they can walk around in their undies feel safe and explore

8708952 my nose completely clogs us my throat will sometimes depending on the type of allergy but will close up as well red puffy eyes just very itchy
8708953 we found that stress and anxiety make a big difference in terms of allergic responses
8708954 if you dont have an allergy youre just going to see a little bit of redness temporary and thatll be the end of it but if youre a highly allergic person youre going to get something called a wheal
8708955 so the take home message is if youre allergic stress and anxiety are a bad combination
8708956 but its summer well the end but we normally invite them during the winter
8708957 i believe everything is fine but if it makes you feel better go talk with him

8708983 nous sommes l pour tre au travail pour les fran ais ce que je demande cest que nous fassions bloc que nous fassions parler les socialistes dune seule voix
8708984 vous donnez trop dimportance au poids des images et pas assez au fond
8708985 chaque fois que je participe une r union socialiste je me sens bien
8708986 jai beaucoup de d fauts mais laissez moi au moins tre un bon militant
8708987 il y a des nuages noirs qui samoncellent sur la situation conomique de la france avec la r cession les socialistes ont une responsabilit minente ils doivent donner une image de retenue tre la hauteur de ce que lon attend de nous et bannir les petites phrases
8708988 i think that was a very good sign that this was not going to be a top down kind of campaign it was going to be a bottom up structure and i think thats working very well
8708989 you know when you go to a restaurant and after eating you feel kind of ripped off because for the amount you paid you can probably make the
8708990 hello mountain vista farms you took the rib dinner off your menu right
8708991 i figured id update since its been near 3 years since i wrote the first review for patrick evan
8708992 how long will it be until you tell me you actually hate it
8708993 its not just a personal opinion that you came up with randomly
8708994 it doesnt need any further discussion just perhaps a little amplification
8708995 what we have learned this year more than ever is that social justice is always the priority to political justice
8708996 so would it not be an anxiety that a woman would feel after seeing someone come so close to wonder when the next time will come will it be in 2020 2040 2060
8708997 can we understand the feelings of individuals who worked hard enough who tried hard enough and who always seemed to come up with less than their talent and character would take them do we really and truly and sincerely recognize what it does to a nation that too often has systematically dismantled opportunity for half of the human race
8708998 then wed understand why a lot of supporters wouldnt say well get em tomorrow or wait till next year because its been next year and next year and next year
8708999 but im just saying how much more foresighted would it have been for him to have made a surprise appearance at the new york delegation or one of his top people or he could have even sent senator biden
8709000 these are the kinds of political strategies that can diffuse a situation like that
8709001 i dont know if i ever thought id really see it
8709002 they told him he was an asset on that ticket
8709003 when they got to the general election they never even mentioned his name in the paid television campaign ads what do you think that did to the people that supported him
8709004 each time one of us has been able to rise above what the standard has been
8709005 the result has been that it has pulled all of us along whether we be latino whether we be gay or lesbian whether we be african american or women
8709006 you cant imagine what we are called upon to do out there
8709007 and x hasnt a clue hes flat out going a million miles an hour
8709008 what you should be is second oboist for the cincinnati symphony
8709009 with ferrari you have not to worry you get in you drive you win
8709010 i could have had him on with me at maserati
8709011 i had to come from behind i spun on the first turn
8709012 i can do it i can go faster than anyone
8709013 i suppose i didnt think it was sporting and yet i was glad to have the advantage
8709014 of course he was better before we went over the cliff in 1953
8709015 id see moss or fangio moving up behind me and id just get out of the way
8709016 they want you to break the lap record every time but they want you to do it slowly
8709017 when they say piano piano go like hell but smile doing it
8709018 if he hadnt been there i could have passed him
8709019 i function best when im doing better than expected of me
8709020 i mean he is tough you wouldnt know it to look at him or to talk to him but when you see what he has done and how hes done it well hes tough
8709021 tough having the quality of being strong but flexible and not brittle yielding to force without breaking capable of resisting great strain without coming apart
8709022 otherwise it would be too inconvenient for people and will largely decrease the efficiency of the city
8709023 actually nowadays many ordinary people sincerely hope that the games could finish sooner
8709024 in my opinion this is the perfect spot for brunch lunch
8709025 last time team officials called me up and said were going out to oakland for a week
8709026 so i pack up some clothes and get out to oakland and look on tv and every thing i own is under water
8709027 weve all had time to put together a clear plan as to how it affects the organization the team the families of the team
8709028 i dont want to go into detail as to what we do because what we do is really predicated on when its supposed to arrive
8709029 we will be focused and ready to play the buccaneers
8709030 were planning on that game being at the superdome but the powers that be will have a clear plan in place if that should change any or if our preparation should have to be somewhere else it wont be a distraction we wont allow it to be
8709031 that first game that right there ill never forget that
8709032 even though we didnt make it to the super bowl that year that was my super bowl i never seen anything like that and i was just happy to see people out in the streets just happy to see the saints play that day thats probably one thing ill always remember about new orleans is that day
8709033 there are some areas where it looks like it happened yesterday
8709034 those are houses people used to live in and theyre not living there any more so where are they
8709035 i felt like we were all kind of in this thing together
8709036 im trying to rebuild my career coming off the injury and changing teams kind of a fresh start for me a fresh start for the organization and a fresh start for the city
8709037 the more you talk to people and the more you drive around i think you just feel like life is back
8709038 when the storm happened your mind set had to be were going to make things better than they were before were going to try to turn this into a positive somehow some way i see that happening in a lot of areas so just to kind of be there and just feel like youre kind of a part of the rebuilding process is rewarding
8709039 das highlight des programms war ein vortrag von teut weidemann der von seinen erfahrungen beim entwickeln des umfangreichen projekts s ldner berichtete
8709040 neben dem rahmenprogramm wurden viele gespr che rund um die games branche gef hrt leider war der abend wie immer viel zu schnell zu ende
8709041 when i used to live a block from this place i would come here every weekend for a great gourmet deli treat
8709042 is that hair stuff working for i forget the dudes name
8709043 continuer comunque anche se non quello che devo e non quello che vuoi
8709044 im sure theres some anxiety because guys want to be20here and theyve worked hard
8709045 there are a lot of guys who have earned the right to be a part of this team but you can only keep so many guys
8709046 theres going to be a lot of competitiveness and its going to be a big night for a lot of these guys there are some battles being waged
8709047 to me the chemistry is always the same and whatever some guys are going through theyre doing a good job at hiding it
8709048 theres a sense of urgency on some guys part but they do a good job of just playing football its always in the back of your mind but thats where it needs to be
8709049 these guys arent walking around moping with a bad spirit and bringing guys down and tampering with the chemistry of the squad whatever the numbers game may be thats fine
8709050 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
8709051 we never lost cabin pressure so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks by the time we got on the ground the crack on the front of the planes window was huge and getting bigger by the second
8709052 it was like in the movies when they land and you see all the fire trucks and emergency crews thats a real experience
8709053 i didnt have any anxiety like the last thing i want to do is get back on an airplane i did feel like the pilots and the flight attendants handled it perfectly they were so very calm it wasnt a scary situation until afterward when you think about what possibly could have happened
8709054 last time team officials called me up and said were going out to oakland for a week pack up a weeks worth of clothes
8709055 so i pack up some clothes and get out to oakland and look on tv and every thing i own is under water
8709056 weve all had time to put together a clear plan as to how it affects the organization the team the families of the team
8709057 i dont want to go into detail as to what we do because what we do is really predicated on when its supposed to arrive
8709058 we will be focused and ready to play the buccaneers
8709059 were planning on that game being at the superdome but the powers that be will have a clear plan in place if that should change any or if our preparation should have to be somewhere else it wont be a distraction we wont allow it to be
8709060 that first game that right there ill never forget that
8709061 even though we didnt make it to the super bowl that year that was my super bowl i never seen anything like that and i was just happy to see people out in the streets just happy to see the saints play that day thats probably one thing ill always remember about new orleans is that day
8709062 there are some areas where it looks like it happened yesterday
8709063 those are houses people used to live in and theyre not living there any more so where are they
8709064 i felt like we were all kind of in this thing together
8709065 im trying to rebuild my career coming off the injury and changing teams kind of a fresh start for me a fresh start for the organization and a fresh start for the city
8709066 the more you talk to people and the more you drive around i think you just feel like life is back

8709068 i think that was a very good sign that this was not going to be a top down kind of campaign it was going to be a bottom up structure and i think thats working very well
8709069 its amazing for me to see all these people who made history together in one place
8709070 im proud to be a democrat im proud to be at my convention im proud to support barack obama we have to build a bigger team including independents and republicans to really change this country
8709071 if we continue to follow this slippery oil slicked downward winding path our citizens will shiver in darkness as our resources hemorrhage to third world thugs whose only virtue is their control of petroleum based energy
8709072 since a number of these projects involve open ground we must get them completed and reseeded by the end of august if we are to get a catch of new grass before fall weather sets in
8709073 theres billions of dollars being spent there that could go to real campaigning and real campaigns
8709074 im proud to be a democrat im proud to be at my convention im proud to support barack obama we have to build a bigger team including independents and republicans to really change this country
8709075 oh my god mom its joe biden can i get a picture with him
8709076 danced and laughed their hearts out prayed for 81st national guard brigade and every night we have cheered and you know what we have cried
8709077 im looking forward to a womans pj party in the white house so we can really hang out
8709078 after they vote for barack obama and joe biden they keep going all the way down that ticket
8709079 i dont want to vote for a rock star i want somebody who is going to take care of the issues
8709080 the evidence in this record clearly shows that marijuana has been accepted as capable of relieving the distress of great numbers of very ill people and doing so with safety under medical supervision
8709081 judge francis young of the drug enforcement administration went on to say
8709082 marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known
8709083 judge young recommended that the dea allow marijuana to be prescribed as medicine but the dea has refused
8709084 if the hideous monster frankenstein came face to face with the monster marijuana he would drop dead of fright
8709085 marijuana is the most violence causing drug in the history of mankind
8709086 most marijuana smokers are negroes hispanics filipinos and entertainers their satanic music jazz and swing result from marijuana usage this marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with negroes
8709087 the barack obama campaign started late to try to reach out to latinos
8709088 they basically gave up the latino vote in the primaries to hillary clinton and theres a struggle now
8709089 polls show that latinos are thinking of voting for obama theyre obviously thinking about voting democratic
8709090 after a couple of electoral seasons when a specific number of latinos went to the republican party up to 40 per cent of latinos voted for george bush in 2004 they are going back to the democratic party because they dont like the way things are going in the country they dont like the immigration rhetoric they dont like the economy they dont like the war
8709091 the level of support that obama has among latinos is still not high enough
8709092 think obama is too young he doesnt understand the us chinese relationship and he really doesnt understand chinas issues
8709093 there really is a reason why during the primaries the super delegates and many influential black people lined up behind hillary
8709094 there was something so different about obama that people needed to be convinced that he was united with the black community in america
8709095 the truth is this is a different guy and hes different in many ways because hes not like african americans are and people know that
8709096 tristan would your sisters mind helping clean up and decorate the castle

8709111 and mention nothing to the females or the twins understand
8709112 your family will remain under the protection of aidans coven
8709113 our hearts just pound when she hits her high notes
8709114 she is simple splendid better than an instrument not even a harp can stand in comparison with her voice
8709115 we have a need to decorate the home for some guests
8709116 he will be back soon do not worry she asked dariens permission if she could go with him
8709117 oh kami ive been meaning to ask you about our human family
8709118 yes i thought humans were not aloud to know of us
8709119 they help keep our home clean and our secrets safe when people go missing while they do that for us we keep them safe from the bastards we hunt many covens have a human family we need someone to help keep our secret safe evaleen has the ability to tell if a human can be trusted she chose the family for darien a hundred years ago hes been protecting them ever sense
8709120 thats why the two of them get along so well hes a walking history book however he can turn his gift on or off at will darien has no control over his visions
8709121 we will get more time together to speak of such things
8709122 they must be here to help get things ready for the hunters guild
8709123 about time ive been wondering about darien all night why was he so upset yesterday
8709124 i asked my husband the same thing while we hunted
8709125 aidan told me that master darien witnessed a very visual vision of the distant future and was surprised
8709126 humans and their advancements in technology we thought the telephone was amazing
8709127 looks like they come up with more exciting things in the future
8709128 when the telephone was released darien purchased three of them once he had the things in his hands he took every one of them apart i have no idea why he did that he cant see to put them back together just a waist
8709129 i am sure if something was wrong master darien would have told us
8709130 im sure darien would not keep us in the shadows
8709131 darien has asked me to stay with you girls for a while
8709132 there were several carriages full of furniture food and other commendations at the front of the castle dariens human family and the men are helping bring things in
8709133 he is truly an amazing man did you know darien used to hunt game with king henry viii
8709134 he used to meet with henry on a normal basis when we were younger big deal
8709135 well i knew he was alive during henrys reign but i had no idea they knew one another
8709136 it was so hard to part with him there is so much going on outside darien says we will be having a full house in a couple days
8709137 kami mentioned that the hunters guild will be visiting us
8709138 the most profitable and desireable crop that can be grown
8709139 ok vamos s seis perguntas que jann pediu que eu fizesse
8709140 although the market is reacting to storm updates there is still some uncertainty about the path of the storm
8709141 how ever nationwide and in maryland the average price for a gallon of gas dropped a fraction of a cent overnight prices across maryland dropped nearly a pen ny or more overnight after already dropping 34 cents on average since a month ago

8709224 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8709225 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8709226 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8709275 senator obama what have you done and what have you run
8709276 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8709277 ever since ive been here ive wanted to be able to pound the football and we havent yet
8709278 so were going to find out because were going to pound it
8709279 the only way to find out is getting the big boys up front to get off the ball and hand it off to those backs youve got to keep fresh legs out there at half back and keep pounding it
8709280 that puts a lot of responsibility in our hands to re establish the line of scrimmage as an offensive lineman thats what you love to do instead of being passive aggressive in pass blocking you need to be aggressive and knock the other guy in the mouth
8709281 i think thats one of the reasons we had such a physical camp we want to be able to use our strength and size
8709282 when you run the ball in your mind youre thinking yes
8709283 you start pounding the ball and coming off the ball as hard as you can defenses come up the field blitzing because of the run game you can see it in their eyes they cant take it any more you keep pushing and pushing and eventually theyll give up
8709284 what coach weis is really saying is we have an offensive line that is a lot bigger and stronger
8709285 we have multiple backs that are running a lot better than they have in past years so it creates an opportunity now for us to run the ball a little more effectively than we have over the past several years
8709286 were teaching them the importance of down and distance red zone football coming out football taking shots were basically doing a lot more teaching of football some of them didnt have any knowledge of the game as far as thats concerned
8709287 were creating an identity by being able to run the football drop back pass play action pass but the most important thing were doing is were teaching guys football were teaching guys situational football
8709288 were teaching guys that on 1st and 10 when we call this play were expecting four yards and it being 2nd and 6
8709289 on the next call were making a call to get us in 3rd and short or to get the first down
8709290 were still looking for a balance but were trying to create better looks for kids in practice
8709291 they now have some recall previously we havent had much recall with the young players
8709292 if you run the ball you can control the clock much better
8709293 if you run the ball effectively you suck the safeties in and you can throw over the top you can play action all kinds of windows open up
8709294 i spend a number of hours primarily doing the same things ive been doing over the last several years
8709295 however i spend a few more late nights instead of going home at 10 or 10 30 i may stay until 12 30 or 1 00
8709296 there are different things to discuss with the offensive staff different things to pass by coach weis when he comes in but its just one day at a time right now
8709297 as an offensive lineman when are you ever going to run a 110 yard sprint
8709298 if you were to recover a fumble i think you would get caught way before you scored although left guard eric olsen probably doesnt think he would
8709299 with pushing sleds king of the ring sumo wrestling type things punching sandbags the list of drills you can run is endless that builds up a specific stamina to push someone its definitely paid dividends thats why i think the transition to this new style has been seamless
8709300 i feel much more confident this year than last year
8709301 i just have to trust myself i trust my feet and my hands and i wasnt doing that before i was playing a little tentative
8709302 two things being a starter in 07 and knowing that the guys have my back
8709303 knowing the left guard will be there because he knows the protection having a year of seeing stuff and then getting beat up last year really makes you work hard in the off season

8709313 i dont know whether i have any clever suggestions the only thing i know for sure is that print and online versions of the newspaper are going to have to work together to survive
8709314 online is having trouble figuring out how to make money and print papers are circling the drain to use a phrase i heard recently from a hardworking print reporter i know
8709315 i like print newspapers because i have an easier time directing my attention to stories that i consider important
8709316 for me this is a balance between what catches my eye and what the newspaper editors amp sic the layout staff think is important additionally a newspaper is more portable for people who dont like portable electronic devices like pdas i do not think that these features came about due to readers behavioral changes i think that these are longstanding features of a print newspaper
8709317 online newspapers are often free and convenient for many people to access still though i dont like any of the available portable electronic gadgets for newspaper reading if i want to read the paper on a train then ill choose the print paper i have always really enjoyed excellent slide shows like those on the ny times site as a feature of online news and more and more im enjoying video too obviously these are online only features yes i do think that changes to online newspapers come about as a result of readers behavioral changes or the changes come about simply because thats what employers will allow i know folks in online newsrooms and sometimes they are faced with ignorant bosses who only let certain changes go through and they might not be the changes that readers most desire

8709362 the walls started moving then the bang everything started coming down everyone started screaming
8709363 every organization has to be ready to abandon everything it does to reinvent itself
8709364 why would i need help finding and buying a house
8709365 we can never be replaced this is a people business and there is always going to be a need for a real estate professional in the transaction
8709366 during the 1970s and early 1980s technological upheavals appearance of the quartz technology and the difficult economic situation resulted in a reduction in the size of the industry the number of employees fell from some 90 000 in 1970 to a little over 30 000 in 1984

8709375 the walls started moving then the bang everything started coming down everyone started screaming
8709376 the bottom line is that to build this water plant the taxpayers are getting soaked
8709377 the need to complete important projects like the water plant has not diminished
8709378 we cant sit back and let others worry about the future
8709379 i have never understood how putting a building underground is cheaper than putting a building aboveground
8709380 all other things being equal it may be more expensive to have the plant underground than at the surface level but it wasnt all other things being equal the length of tunneling that was required at the respective sites was a significant factor
8709381 the thruway has already jacked up its tolls we want to make sure that motorists arent being shaken down at the pump too there are limits to how much stations on the thruway can charge our audit will look at whether or not those limits are being adhered to anyone who drives the thruway knows gas prices are higher and motorists are forced to pay those prices there arent a lot of options once you get on the thruway but just because those stations have a captive market doesnt give them license to gouge at the gas pump gas prices are high enough already
8709382 in buffalo we are paying 3 97 right now a gallon and here there at 3 85 so its a bonus for me now traveling down the thruway i was actually surprised that they are cheaper on the thruway
8709383 you kind of have to think about where youre going to stop for gas instead of waiting till its almost empty
8709384 i fill up in albany because i can drive all the way to buffalo with one tank of gas its like 40 cents more in buffalo than in albany
8709385 this follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value i think what were seeing is evolutionary
8709386 what were dealing with here is a use of the technology that i dont think the good people at magellan or garmin or tomtom really thought about when they were developing it
8709387 typically the gps data being used is for the purpose of contradicting defendants alibis
8709388 its not too late to discover what many new yorkers have already found this summer camping at a state park is a fun inexpensive way to getaway
8709389 were looking forward to hosting even more fun outings this labor day weekend when campers can squeeze in another summer trip to new yorks great state parks if youre looking for a fun escape this holiday i recommend visiting one of the many scenic state parks right here in our own backyard
8709390 the virus did not attempt any malicious or destructive operations the virus was never a threat to any of the computers that are used for command and control station and hasnt had any adverse effect on the station operations
8709391 this is really just a nuisance for us at this point
8709392 how it got there is really the question they should be asking themselves
8709393 if theres no direct internet access like theyre saying and theres no intranet access like theyre saying then it was probably transferred onto it either via a cd or stick or something like that
8709394 if i was them i would take this as a wake up call because it could have been a far more nasty piece of malware
8709395 the presence of any malware should be taken very seriously but it could have been a lot worse
8709396 more and more its simply unsafe surfing thats exposing users to malware these days
8709397 users really need to consider having those kinds of things disabled so you have to load them manually that way if that external device actually has a piece of malware on it the auto run functionality is disabled and it wont at least automatically copy itself over
8709398 thats a very good best practice for everybody to implement
8709399 we probably can get by with one and just add tables and data elements to capture some of the unique services some of these systems do

8709410 its great to see microsoft moving forward with ie and trying to innovate in the browser they are making the correct choices regarding standards support and privacy
8709411 the launching of linked articles in new tabs coupled with the automatic grouping and color coding is probably the killer feature for me
8709412 i hate losing the page im looking at when i click on a link and there is a huge architecture change here where rather than always navigating away from a page you tend to with ie8 stay on the page but still see additional information
8709413 this means that youll find sites even if you type something other than just the first part of the web address to make it easier to find what youre looking for we group the results and highlight the matched text
8709414 the smart address bar appears to go farther than the very popular firefox awesome bar what it does differently is that when it displays addresses while you type one in it groups them making the feature vastly more useful
8709415 standout features for me include inprivate browsing and accelerators formerly known as
8709416 the improvements in compatibility mean fewer problems with pages that werent optimized for ie and this alone will probably reduce substantially the movement from ie to alternatives
8709417 the installation process took a bit longer than i expected and required a reboot id contrast that with the very clean and quick firefox installation process but its probably unavoidable given ies integration with windows at some fairly low levels
8709418 firefox and ie is where the battle is being fought and ie remains the dominant product i think this release should be enough to stop folks from leaving ie to go to firefox particularly given some of the problems with the latest firefox release
8709419 to the extent that we can when the city transfers these rental properties over for a dollar we want to make sure that the people who are going to be running them have a good solid track record and theyre going to put people in good quality housing and treat them with respect

8709422 we are very pleased that judge lloyd has recognized veohs strict compliance with the dmca and our dedication to providing a valuable service for users that respects the rights of content owners
8709423 one of the questions is why do they do it
8709424 do they do it because they believe twitter or facebook or blogs create more discourse and citizen engagement or do they do it because being in that world draws attention to the news media as being hip or technologically timely i have the sort of cynical suspicion that they do it for the latter reason more to appear current than it is for some strong romantic or moral belief that citizen contribution has an impact on a sense of self government
8709425 theres nothing wrong with old uses modified for the new channels of communications
8709426 but it is somewhat suspicious to say oh look how progressive the new technology is its an incremental improvement not some kind of magic silver bullet it does show that news organizations are really paying attention to this stuff the lesson learned from the early 90s when the web was new was that the news industry totally missed out it signals a shift to me that news organizations have recognized theyre going to think more about this stuff theyve recognized that they have to think more about technology in their strategic planning

8709428 i do worry about children being abducted because it happens
8709429 i think the best choice is to protect them as long as you can
8709430 she and i do not see eye to eye on this
8709431 im pretty certain ive been called a hypocrite because of the way i was raised
8709432 it depends upon the child and it depends upon the neighborhood
8709433 one of the fears that parents expressed was that their children could be harmed or kidnapped
8709434 in fact more kids are hurt by the cars of parents driving other kids to school considerably more the percentage of kids who are nabbed on their way to school is minuscule
8709435 we havent encouraged them to walk alone at any specific age
8709436 some of the neighborhoods are not such that we recommend it
8709437 we never expect or encourage even 10 year olds to be riding their bikes alone
8709438 we have a number of parents who are also walking with our middle school students
8709439 long story short my son got home ecstatic with independence
8709440 long story longer and analyzed to boot half the people ive told this episode to now want to turn me in for child abuse as if keeping kids under lock and key and helmet and cell phone and nanny and surveillance is the right way to rear kids its not its debilitating for us and for them
8709441 i like him being independent and i like him to be a little confident and get places by himself

8709445 we get a whole bunch of little ones all the time
8709446 it doesnt have any implication of other earthquakes on land or big ones
8709447 that whole area is where the two oceanic plates are moving and that drives magmatic activity and you do get swarms of earthquakes like that but there are other faults and features that could be responsible
8709448 were in a tsunami zone theres signs all over our harbour were quite aware of it
8709449 when the big one comes itll be pretty exciting around here i think
8709450 because of recent memories of what happened in asia in 2004 as soon as people hear about there being an earthquake they immediately think of a tsunami
8709451 not all types of earthquakes cause tsunamis it has to be big and it has to occur with the right type of faulting
8709452 its absolutely stupid that were pouring out that kind of money and getting nothing for it
8709453 theres no jobs created no taxes paid and no profit made
8709454 i have seen our team go through adversity and i have seen how they react
8709455 some of it is not always as good as we want the team has also seen me go through adversity and handle disappointments when you do that there is trust to be built
8709456 in any job those first 365 days you learn more than you probably do in the next five years combined there isnt the feeling of anxiety heading into your second season
8709457 verisign facilitated an average of approximately 572 million messages per day in q2 2008 compared to approximately 476 million messages per day in q1 2008 and approximately 230 million messages per day in q2 2007 verisigns network also set a single day record by enabling 648 million texts over a 24 hour period and a one hour record of 42 million messages
8709458 contributing to this growth were increases in the steady adoption of mobile banking services by verisigns customers including 7 of the top 10 banks in the united states and a 30 percent increase in traffic volumes for standard and premium a2p traffic messages carried in europe

8709464 from what i understand of stanley he was really quiet
8709465 im sure he had friends but i dont know if he created long lasting friends or relationships
8709466 it was just high school stuff he wasnt ever any real trouble
8709467 some credit didnt count or something and he went back and graduated with the other class
8709468 madelyn sometimes could not do a lot of the things the other girls could

8709471 our parents just wouldnt tell a lie they said its so much easier to tell the truth because you just dont have to worry about it
8709472 it may be a function of social perceptions of alcohol in that particular region
8709473 it has had a very negative impact on our day to day life
8709474 but i saw a man yesterday who knows a fellow who had it from a chappie that said that urquhart had been dipping himself a bit recklessly off the deep end
8709475 all of a sudden we now had a rule book to go by and when we had problems the preacher was right there to give us the answers
8709476 we have met with families in which for weeks together not an article of sustenance but potatoes had been used yet for every child the hard earned sum was provided to send them to school
8709477 gates of hell will never gainst that church prevail we have christs own promise and it cannot fail

8709480 we have met with families in which for weeks together not an article of sustenance but potatoes had been used yet for every child the hard earned sum was provided to send them to school
8709481 when we began first to preach these things the people appeared as awakened from the sleep of ages they seemed to see for the first time that they were responsible beings

8709492 the first president bush i didnt agree with him on everything but he was a real president you know what i mean
8709493 what we have to do is to try to restore the confidence of the american people that the system is on the level
8709494 just used a little willpower and didnt smoke any more
8709495 i started walking today i brushed my own teeth today sat up in a chair today fed myself today

8709497 es una obra que no puede faltar en las bibliotecas de nuestros lectores c mo conseguirlo
8709498 hes taller than me but i believe im going to be stronger
8709499 when people started saying manny can beat you and manny can knock you out and especially when freddie roach started saying oscar cant pull the trigger or manny pacquiao the fighter i train can beat you it started to become a challenge to me
8709500 now its very personal especially when manny pacquiao beat all the legendary mexican fighters from mexico to me its a challenge people are talking people are talking that manny pacquiao can beat me well well see dec 6
8709501 last year i knew that after u s open i was going to stop working with my ex coach
8709502 i wanted to work with heinz guenthardt but he could not travel a lot so we needed to find a guy who could
8709503 i need to thank ivan ljubicic because he advised me about krajan after the australia open in january i decided okay im going to work with him
8709504 first well give it a try until french open it turned out really good and now we working together
8709505 so i think i need to thank ljubicic or invite him for dinner
8709506 i was working with the dutch guy for almost two years at the end we just stopped listening to each other
8709507 he would not accept what i would say he didnt want to hear my opinions this is the reason why we started to fight a lot on the court
8709508 i have enough stress on the court playing a match and if i go for practice and im still fighting with my coach i dont need this
8709509 so i decided i better try with somebody else maybe who would listen a little bit more to me
8709510 i would never imagine that one tennis coach would have so much patience for me
8709511 i would scream cry whatever and he would say okay lets go keep on going
8709512 ive had certain putts i had in real life competition break the same way and by the same amount
8709513 what is involved when we say what people are doing and why they are doing it
8709514 and believed that such an approach to language analysis and use could help us understand the basis of conflict the virtues and dangers of cooperation and the opportunities of identification and consubstantiality
8709515 a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in beings that by nature respond to symbols
8709516 the symbol using making and mis using animal inventor of the negative separated from his natural condition by instruments of his own making goaded by the spirit of hierarchy and rotten with perfection
8709517 been built up for us through nothing but our symbol system
8709518 clutter of symbols about the past combined with whatever things we know mainly through maps magazines newspapers and the like about the present a construct of our symbol systems
8709519 ive had certain putts i had in real life competition break the same way and by the same amount

8709525 the material that was supposed to be destroyed was already superseded and had been replaced
8709526 there is no risk to the security of the weapon system and no possibility of an inadvertent launch as a result of this being taken from the weapon facility
8709527 they are not obviously working missile alert duties until the investigation is complete
8709528 the male has been temporarily reassigned while its being investigated
8709529 as chair of the ncaa mens ice hockey committee i can assure that the xcel center was awarded the bid due to the tremendous reputation of the facility and the work of individuals like jack larson at the center and marc ryan from our staff
8709530 the committee has made a conscious decision to try to move regional competition off campuses and olympic sized rinks while still preserving a great college hockey atmosphere the xcel center does just that
8709531 the xcel center is one of the top hockey facilities in north america
8709532 the ncaa made a terrific choice for the fans and the teams that will be playing in the tournament you want to have an ncaa regional in a first class facility and the xcel will do a fantastic job hosting the event
8709533 this is a great place to get started on my next goal my next dream of trying to get more people involved in the sport of swimming but also more people involved in exercising
8709534 i hope im literally not a fish out of water in that one
8709535 i prefer the word motivation because people cant change a behavior unless they have motivation
8709536 we dont use the word willpower we prefer the word motivation
8709537 suck it up soldier whats wrong with you have some willpower
8709538 i did that i do that kind of thing in many ways its a permanent part of who i am
8709539 it was the situation and that situation was unique anyway itll be different next time
8709540 he is a veteran leader who has been on winning teams and will be a great addition to our frontcourt
8709541 one under was a good score today with the wind and the soft greens
8709542 i think that some greens drain better than these theres no question
8709543 so well have to look into that at a future date
8709544 this was ok one over is by no means out of this tournament
8709545 e o grupa in care putem termina pe locul 1 dar si pe locul 4
8709546 when i take that walk to the ring to fight oscar i will carry all the people of the philippines the entire country on my shoulders
8709547 i promise i will fight with all of my heart and that i will give everything i have like my fight of my life
8709548 it was difficult i wont tell you that its not because we had some doors shut in our face early
8709549 there were enough young people out there that when we sat down and told them what we expected this program to be and what the vision of this program was going to be that they were able to buy into this vision and they were able to see themselves
8709550 i think i was one of the later players to finally see the vision
8709551 i found it kind of hard to believe while being recruited in 2007 that a year from now that well be playing and i just see a patch of field and a track around it
8709552 i started looking into this conference and i started talking to coach steele and he described to me what the buildings are going to look like how its going to feel all the new incoming atmosphere
8709553 and he told me up front everybodys a freshman and everybodys going to be getting a fair shot and thats all i could ask for
8709554 at campbell steele told him you are kind of small but youre talented
8709555 it was a need to know more thing because the team was not playing for a year but at the same time if i went anywhere else im pretty sure i would have got redshirted and wouldnt play for a year anyway so thats what kind of equaled it out for me
8709556 weve all invested a lot of ourselves in this program
8709557 i have invested a lot of myself in this program in terms of building day by day of this program the small details that need to be taken care of to build a solid program that i felt would represent this university and stand the test of time
8709558 im going to obviously be nervous because we dont know yet where we are this will be the first litmus test of where we stand today because we can guess we can estimate
8709559 but we really dont know until after saturday what we have to do to move the program forward from the way that we handle it administratively as we get a large crowd here to the way we handle players on the football field to the way they handle things they dont know yet we all feel like were as absolutely prepared as we can be but we all have that nervousness and if you dont have that nervousness its time to stop playing the game
8709560 this is a classic partnership where were leveraging mutual assets
8709561 young guys are still watching live action sports so we still have a big presence there but theyre also spending a lot of time gaming thats where guys are these days
8709562 gaming is part of the bridge to that next group of consumers theyre trying to tap into
8709563 at the same time its not so far away from their core consumers and their group of classic sports like golf and football
8709564 this is the first time anything of this scope has been done before
8709565 i think that curry is going to be one of the areas top backs
8709566 it seems our guys always have to prove themselves during their senior season and they always come through im sure curry will do the same
8709567 the thing about curry that separates him from the pack is hes very explosive and has great speed
8709568 curry has also improved his catching skills making him even more of a threat
8709569 you have to know how to block in our offense and thats another skill of currys
8709570 im sure that curry will be getting a lot of attention once colleges see some senior film
8709571 was das auge nicht sieht kann die faust nicht treffen
8709572 hey guys i found this in the news and it made my blood boil summary execution for bincrime can you believe it what the hell sort of state is this country getting into
8709573 the desperate libertarian comments link on the execution for bincrime thing yet another example of the insanity of modern britain
8709574 and now according to link council jobsworths will get to shoot people on the spot for leaving their bins out on the wrong day
8709575 listen you f c s i am a free man not a number so you can take your f dustbins and shove em up your f corporate a and if i see one of your gunslinging enforcers up here its gonna be 7
8709576 oh well i suppose it must have been worse under the tsar
8709577 yeah well its completely evil thats what it is but what am i supposed to do about it theyve got me over a barrel i just have to tag along in the hope that they dont notice me i cant afford to be evicted have my house repossessed have the children taken away get put on some database to be rounded up later get on the wrong side of the police council masons etc
8709578 but im afraid of the terrorists im afraid of the padeophiles im afraid of being called a paedophile if im not sufficiently afraid of the paedophiles im afraid of the government they know everything about me already people like you ought not to be talking like this
8709579 the governments right the people they ought to keep files on are all the ones who dont like the idea of files being kept on em nothing to hide nothing to fear right right

8709587 an interest bearing account from which members of the california settlement class can make claims
8709588 a three year relationship during which the advocacy group will keep testing the site to make sure it is accessible to the blind
8709589 we continue to be a good serve and block team and hold our opponents to low hitting percentages
8709590 however the two areas we need to fix from last year are our offensive efficiency and our mental toughness in crucial situations we had three to five matches that could have easily swung our way had the right plays been made and that is a huge difference when you look at the overall view of the season
8709591 our senior class will play a big role in the success of this team
8709592 this group has had a variety of experiences throughout their career as a senior class they view this as their chance to leave their legacy and lead the team to a high level of success in their final seasons i think they gained a lot of confidence and played well during the spring season however they must now carry that into the fall to help this team succeed at a high level
8709593 i think christine tan has really done a great job in the backrow in her two years with the program and gained valuable experience as our libero last year
8709594 i am also excited about our sophomore class who has a lot of talent and played well in their first year last season it is hard to play right away as a freshman and despite some struggles last year they played great for us and should really make a big jump forward in their second year with the team
8709595 we might not have the most marquee players in the nation but we got exactly what we went after we add a setter who can hit the ground running right away a quality middle blocker and both defensive players should help right away we also add pam luiz who is a very savvy outside hitter and should make an impact at that spot
8709596 any coach in a team sport loves competition for playing time at different spots among the players on the team
8709597 competition for a position is the best motivator for a player and will be beneficial to the success of our team this season
8709598 i think our players gained a great deal of confidence from the spring season and are ready to move forward and have a successful 2008 campaign
8709599 i think we got a similar result to a lesser degree out of our trip to puerto rico as we did when we returned from europe two years ago our players got to bond spend more time with each other and gained more of a trust to rely on each other in difficult situations i liked the way our team played in crunch time during the spring hopefully they can take that mentality and apply it successfully this year
8709600 we are looking for rachel to embrace her role as a senior setter and provide stability and leadership on the floor
8709601 she has had a great deal of experience and played at a high level for us however we are looking for her to take the next step and play with more confidence and flair
8709602 i think we have a great setting situation heading into the season
8709603 rachel is a talented and experienced setter who will give us senior leadership however we also think alex is ready to play at this level at this point and she will come in and push rachel to raise the level of her game right away
8709604 brook dieter had a great freshman season and we need here to continue to improve because she can play all the way around for us on the court
8709605 kyla is coming off shoulder surgery but has been hitting the ball hard during the summer again katie is an experienced player who can play opposite or outside hitter for us i really like the fact that all of the returning players have the versatility to do that pam comes to us as a junior college transfer out of brazil she is a very smart and crafty outside hitter and she has great overall court play as a defender and a passer another player who could be in the outside hitter mix at some point is hailey cowles she is our best volleyball player and she can do a lot of different things on the court overall we are happy with the versatility and skill that this group of outside hitters provides us
8709606 this group of middle blockers gives us options heading into the season
8709607 kelly is coming off a great spring season and we are looking for her to continue to play at that level
8709608 in fact it should be our strongest position on the court we are excited about all four players christine will obviously have the advantage as the libero having played the position at this level last year there will be strong competition among all four players throughout the year which should make us a better team
8709609 it is always a big part of our preparation early in the season to seek out the best competition
8709610 i have always thought that good competition always brings the best out of our team and we strive to get best out of our players with tough matchups in non conference play to start the season all that in addition to the tough big ten schedule means we need to be ready to be good from the start
8709611 will not enter his plea to the indictement until the new one which he will be judged upon is finished
8709612 we will ensure that it reflects the current case law facts already established by the court and evidence collected over the past eight years
8709613 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subjected to over a long period by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8709614 when theres so many discrimination cases coming out by ethnic minorities that speaks for itself
8709615 i think that there are even further allegations against sir ian at the moment which are probably just as serious i think its an accumulation of many allegations against him
8709616 foreign countries are monitoring and keeping a close watch and waiting for a showdown
8709617 i assign police to do this task without forcibly dispersing the rally

8709619 today the state railway of thailand union has already gone on strike for the first day and tomorrow the unionists at other state enterprises will meet to join them

8709624 peter boal pnb artistic director and the stagers setting the ballet on behalf of the choreographer were looking for someone with less experience and younger to do the role romeo matches my sensibility i have always loved the character as much as i like to have a good time i am not a jokester like mercutio and it would be a stretch to be tybalt although i would enjoy the challenge i grew up seeing the oregon shakespeare festival postlewaite was reared in santa cruz calif and i always wanted to dance that role it was a total dream doing romeo did not seem like i was acting it was not putting something on we are all humans with feelings of love and betrayal and heartbreak with romeo i feel as if i am reliving those feelings in front of an audience
8709625 i like dancing her work it is a cool process she demands a lot of others and herself by the night of the premiere tharp will have spent two months at pnb she can be a little intimidating but she has been really wonderful

8709634 weve always known from direct customer feedback and informal estimates that grid mp is a product that delivers deep financial benefits but its certainly gratifying to have this validated by a 3rd party analysis
8709635 univa ud is all about better performance for a better price clearly as this paper shows with grid mp our customers stand to enjoy huge gains in many areas beyond the obvious reductions in hardware costs
8709636 i was surprised at the number of areas in which this technology delivers economic benefits
8709637 i think most people make the assumption that grid technology simply replaces hardware so thats the main area where roi gets estimated but it actually goes way beyond that
8709638 in fact hardware purchase avoidance only represents 5 of the total first year savings for this company and is not factored in at all for the millions in savings after year one

8709640 im just looking out out there at the pepsi center and thinking about next august
8709641 when the democrats nominate hillary clinton as their candidate for president
8709642 one of the ways for sen obama to win the west frankly is to understand that we have an important priority that we put on our land our water and our wild places here in this state
8709643 i know the price of success dedication hard work and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen
8709644 well its a big night its a big night for me its a big night for new mexico and its thrilling
8709645 even though we didnt make it as president even though we didnt make it as vice president the country will be listening to my national security message and why im so supportive of sen obama
8709646 the goal of the speech is to say obama is ready to be commander in chief
8709647 and what im trying to do is reinforce the view that to be a good president you have to have more than long experience you have to have values good judgment and obama in opposing the war early showed he had that early early vision
8709648 they were broad themes the speeches were about values they were about what america stands for rather than ten point plans
8709649 i think those are the speeches that you remember and are important
8709650 im not going have any laughs or jokes because the subject is national security its foreign policy its values its too important a speech to bring the crowd to its feet
8709651 so im sure it will get panned but thats fine i think we have to establish obama as the candidate that can be an effective commander in chief
8709652 it was an iraq speech and i wanted to add what i believe is important also like that we follow the constitution human rights darfur doing something about poverty
8709653 so i just added and made it a broader speech than just focused on ending the war
8709654 you know it wasnt my year this was the year that the public wanted change they wanted soaring rhetoric and they wanted people coming together
8709655 on global warming on renewable energy on ending the war

8709657 we were on an operation in beit awwa to arrest some wanted men and had reached a darkened basement when we found two naked human beings
8709658 the place stunk like a stable and the ground was covered with hay
8709659 they shouted saying that if we go near the place their son bassam would cut us to pieces we later learned that he is mentally disabled
8709660 they are mentally disabled but we are taking very good care of them the police are lying
8709661 my husband was married to his maternal cousin and they had seven children five of them were born with various types of handicaps and have all passed away only nawal and bassam were left and we could not place them in any institution
8709662 we lock them up to keep them away from people and children out on the streets who could harm them we are not holding them prisoner
8709663 some people hide their mentally disabled children and dont speak about them because they are afraid this will harm their reputation

8709677 we have set a cultural programme for the mahdi army and we have named it al mumahidun supporters of the mahdi and everybody should abide by it and whoever does not agree with it will be expelled from the army
8709678 we want to transform as large a number as we can of mahdi army fighters into a social organisation
8709679 the resistance is for the professional fighters only that will be selected according to sadrs rules
8709680 there are around 1 500 people from both the communities who have been rescued by the police

8709813 if three out of every 10 students in the nation failing to graduate is reason for concern then the fact that just half of those educated in americas largest cities are finishing high school truly raises cause for alarm and the much higher rates of high school completion among their suburban counterparts who may literally live and attend school right around the corner place in a particularly harsh and unflattering light the deep undercurrents of inequity that plague american public education

8709823 slash and burn why does the national rifle association leadership support congresss biggest opponents of conservation
8709824 the nra has long claimed to represent hunters and shooters but todays alarming report the first of its kind ever produced pulls the curtain back on the ugly truth the nra has overwhelmingly supported the biggest opponents of conservation we want americas 70 million gun owners most of whom like me consider themselves conservationists to have the opportunity to learn about the nras dismal record on conservation
8709825 with research from the league of conservation voters and the assistance of former congressman pete mccloskey we launched this effort today but will keep fighting until the nra starts working for hunters and shooters instead of against them
8709826 that for the nra to have given pombo any money was an outrage
8709827 this report is based on solid data compiled by many respected groups including the league of conservation voters

8709834 we went to cook country jail today marched around the jail chanting educate or die and spoke to 1 000 men in division four asking them to write letters to their family to have them take their children to school next tuesday
8709835 last week we took a letter to tom dart and asked him to provide paper envelopes and stamps and he did saying yes
8709836 the media here pretty much ignored the million father march for 5 years
8709837 the mfm is all over the country in new york is huge were in 475 cities including chicago were expecting 600 000 fathers across the country to take their kids to school and those are just the cities who are registered with us
8709838 every day i hear about cities we have no connection to doing million father march and thats what we want we dont control the mfm anymore its something that every community controls
8709839 were not leaving anybody behind i had a white man from traverse city mi call me and ask can white people participate in the million father march i said yes if you have children he went out and recruited 25 other small cities in central michigan where the total minority population is less than 2 percent to participate
8709840 the rev meeks brought up this boycott and now people are giving me the opportunity to talk about mfm and things i think we need to do to educate poor black poor latino poor rural white children
8709841 but we are going to depart with him on the first day in fact were going to door to door in low attendance communities to make sure the kids come to school we even have teachers out doing it
8709842 see were doing it all we were going to keep working for the money to equalize educational opportunities and were going to keep talking about fathers and mothers becoming involved in childrens educations how that leads to a better education higher test scores higher graduation rates less drop outs less drugs less school suspensions and less pregnancies thats what we should be doing
8709843 this is not wellll its sept 2 nd the kids are back no well keep working
8709844 the main reason for establishing ourselves under the banner of this wonderful club is simply based on the facts that we liberians and africans tend to behave differently in many different settings it is interesting how we follow protocols at our various jobs speak within allotted time abide by established procedures and sadly do it differently in our community meetings events and gatherings get angry when asked to make our point within a specified timeframe or respond negatively when urged to live by basic rules

8709894 la prima condizione per cui il cristianesimo si realizza come avvenimento laffezione a s alla propria umanit
8709895 di recente ho vissuto un fenomeno per me strano sentirmi nella posizione di giovanni e andrea quando incontrarono ges per la prima volta
8709896 sono seduto a un bar prendo un caff con un amico e c una sedia vuota come per un altro ospite allora comincio a pensare a come sarebbe se arrivasse lui come potrei fare a riconoscerlo che aspetto avrebbe
8709897 una giungla buia allinterno della quale cammino a tentoni e tocco senza riuscire a capire se sono buone o cattive
8709898 l ho incontrato gente che guardava tutti i miei desideri e mi ha invitato a fare un viaggio questo il meeting lincontro lunico incontro che io conosca
8709899 ho conosciuto cos la realt del cristianesimo vissuto attraverso le opere buone dalle suore e dai frati che insegnavano l da allora continua cresciuta sempre di pi la mia spiritualit e la convinta adesione ai valori non negoziabili la sacralit della vita la dignit della persona che comporta la libert personale in particolare quella religiosa oggi messa sempre pi spesso a repentaglio
8709900 la religione del dio che si fa testo e si incarta nel corano
8709901 come musulmano laico moderato e impegnato a cercare la compatibilit dellislam con i diritti umani fondamentali ho dovuto prendere atto che questa non possibile non infatti possibile approcciarsi con gli strumenti della ragione e della critica ad un testo il corano considerato intangibile e ingiudicabile come dio ho compiuto approfonditi studi sui testi della religione islamica e posso dire che molti versetti legittimano lideologia dellodio e della violenza la stessa biografia ufficiale di maometto riconosciuta dal mondo islamico descrive la vita del profeta come un guerriero che si macchiato di efferati crimini come luccisione di settecento ebrei a medina nel 627 d c
8709902 ma questa mia condanna alla religione vuole puntualizzare non inficia lamore autenticamente cristiano verso i musulmani che accettano e vivono secondo i valori universali vanno dunque rispettati ed inoltre necessario incoraggiare un lavoro per costruire insieme il mondo
8709903 con la certezza della nostra verit senza accostarci al relativismo per cui si devono mettere su un piano di parit tutte le religioni questo permette di agire da protagonisti per edificare il bene comune
8709904 when you get an education that is something nobody can take from you money is only temporary but what you have in your head if you have the right kind of head stays with you
8709905 and surely struggle against him we must in every possible way who would annihilate knowledge and reason and mind and yet ventures to speak confidently about everything
8709906 when the power of love becomes stronger than the love of power we will have peace
8709907 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads
8709908 from the day we went to school we learned nothing on the contrary we were made obtuse we were wrapped in a fog of words and abstractions
8709909 ive always said that theres nothing an atheist cant do if hes really unsure whether he believes anything or not
8709910 to my surprise she bit me and drew blood i saw her lick the blood from her lips then she looked at me like i was a piece of meat
8709911 im sure of it their mouths were dripping with saliva and they had sharp fangs unlike anything id ever seen before
8709912 its very unusual for an animal to develop a taste for flesh
8709913 its as if cattle have it in for humanity as a whole
8709914 when she turned around and bit my leg ive never been so scared in my life
8709915 i know what it isnt and thats an ordinary alligator
8709916 i had it in my possession for almost three hours and im telling you this thing is smart as a whip now dont get me wrong im not saying its human but it certainly doesnt take a scientist to tell you that its not reptilian at least not all reptilian
8709917 there is already some speculation that it might be a distant ancestor of man a missing link that jumped off the evolutionary ladder and blazed its own trail into the modern era im personally going to postpone judgment until i have more information in hand
8709918 lets just say i alerted the authorities and they arrived in what i would consider record time
8709919 they seized the creature and thanked me for my trouble moments later they were out the door and quite frankly i havent heard from them since they arent returning my calls and for the time being at least i dont expect they will
8709920 one source did tell me that the feds had come in but thats all i know
8709921 it warmed up a little when i offered it some food
8709922 my assistant had some fried chicken and a piece of chocolate cake left over from lunch and it gobbled them up bones and all like there was no tomorrow
8709923 after that it remained wary but showed no sign of fear it was eerie really to watch it watch us that face is distinctly human and the eyes are clearly intelligent when i spoke with my assistant i couldnt shake the feeling that the creature understood at least some of what we were saying
8709924 ive never experienced anything quite like it thats for sure
8709925 the water is dirty but what can we do we dont have any other choice
8709926 people like us who earn three or four dollars a day we spend it all on generators
8709927 hes on vacation ive been told thats all im allowed to say hes on vacation
8709928 ill even go one step further with you than ive gone with other reporters
8709929 trusted by our allies and respected and feared by our enemies
8709930 will do what is in our national interest even when it means bucking public opinion polls and even when it means standing up to his own party
8709931 can not be appeased by sweet reason or appeals to the better angels of their nature
8709932 i wish that senator obama would just say that the surge has worked
8709933 obviously these are two businessmen that are known in the community
8709934 millions of americans suffer from problem or pathological gambling that can destroy families we support legislation prohibiting gambling over the internet or in student athletics by student athletes who are participating in competitive sports
8709935 i started walking today i brushed my own teeth today sat up in a chair today fed myself today
8709936 most of it was things said by tony and even his father don they hit our soft spots and we took some of the things kind of personal it was obvious we didnt care for each other much
8709937 i look back at those days when we didnt get along and wonder if there was malicious intent in the things they said
8709938 the more i know tony and don the more i realize they sometimes say things without thinking about the impact of those words on others
8709939 one thing ive tried to drill into tonys head since ive been here is that you never want to give your rivals more motivation to beat you just let the car do the talking
8709940 alan and gary were so much better than everyone else
8709941 hes a better driver now because the car gives him confidence
8709942 he knows hell win most races if he just does his job so the focus is there
8709943 hes a great crew chief one of the best ever so to hear him say anything complimentary is a big deal to me
8709944 we had a team meeting the other day to address the rumors about him leaving the team he said were part of something very special that this is a truly great team he told us hes excited to come to the track every day
8709945 i mean were not gonna go out and have beers and hang out we joke around but when the race is over we go our own way
8709946 turning the house upside down adding weight to it and shaking it
8709947 most people agree that a playoff system adds a great level of excitement late in the year
8709948 it definitely gets more media attention and it keeps many more racers and sponsors involved in the process
8709949 we thought the two tiered system would add a second level of excitement but given the nature of drag racing the racers themselves ended up being a little uncomfortable with it we said wed tweak this deal so thats what we did
8709950 having six races to decide it all will allow for a little back and forth amongst the teams and the luck factor is minimized
8709951 itll be easier to follow because its more consistent with what you see in other sports
8709952 you can have one or two not so great races out of six and still survive
8709953 its fairer this way it wont be one person just lucking out and winning it all at the end
8709954 if at first you dont succeed call it version 1 0
8709955 next year were going to have a new congress probably even a more broader democratic majority
8709956 i think we have a real good opportunity to move toward the direction that we want
8709957 as a result of the acts of empathy ritual and symbolism with a dash of hope and good branding thank you hrh prince charles you will get better the tablets are an essential part of the process but they are completely inert
8709958 if people need delusions faith belief then to deprive them is not to liberate them but to enforce an unnatural rationality upon them
8709959 this might be a real drug or it can be placebo
8709960 funny he never attacks the many disasters perpetrated by mainstream big pharma
8709961 its all in the book ooh which is out in about a week now
8709962 presumably its as evidence based an analysis as he is used to doing know the results you want and marshall the facts accordingly

8709969 he gave a litany of problems that he had heard from middle class people as he sped into washington on the taxpayer dime using amtrak a boondogle he has vigirously defended during his entire senate career and to which he has directed
8709970 and folks these are not isolated discussions among families down on their luck
8709971 i concluded your professed concern for the institution and the public interest was genuine and admirable
8709972 he was a beautiful boy im telling you this from the heart not because he was my grandson but because he was a very good boy
8709973 you could just talk to him and have a laugh he was my guy and someone has just taken him away
8709974 i am appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time of the murder to please contact police with any information you may have
8709975 the incident happened close to a well lit bus garage
8709976 did you see several males in the grass area near to the bus garage and close to selborne walk shopping centre did you see anyone run away from the scene
8709977 could be felt as a provocation on the part of the population of alto adige 99 per cent of whom are catholic
8709978 not art but a blasphemy and a disgusting piece of trash that offends many people
8709979 injured the feelings of many people who see in the cross the symbol of the love of god and of our salvation which deserves recognition and religious devotion
8709980 not only wounds the religious feelings of many who see in the cross the symbol of the love of god but also offends the good sense and feelings of those who do not identify with the symbol
