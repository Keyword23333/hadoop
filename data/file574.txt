5740071 our taxi operator engagement is very extensive including the steering committee technical committee and 18 affected associations with assistance being provided by the city in terms of consulting and logistical support
5740072 we as joburg interact with the level of industry concurrent with our sphere of government which is the regional structures of the taxi industry we dont have a mandate to speak to santaco we dont have a mandate to speak to the national taxi alliance
5740073 the taxi industry moves the largest percentage of the commuting public and yet the industry was not involved in the brt system by this attitude the government is simply disempowering the taxi industry
5740074 unless the difficulty is really that the industry is not confined to those people we are engaging with and understandably people that would not have the benefit of the information to the same level as those in the steering committee or the technical working committee do are feeling left out

5740096 i had my day in court and thats all im entitled to
5740097 you dont go to the hospital for ankle surgery and end up in the morgue
5740098 for any doctor to come here and say oxycontin doesnt have a thing to do with mr brenns death then a they dont know what theyre talking about which is not true
5740099 or b theyre prepared to come up with every excuse on earth to protect a fellow doctor
5740100 they go ballistic they go nuts how can ordinary people second guess me
5740101 somewhere in the middle of this someone lost a life
5740102 if you listen to mr barton its almost a conspiracy to the level of the jfk shooting
5740103 they didnt waffle they said the medication prescribed here was nothing out of the ordinary
5740104 i guess youre being asked to figure out how the loss of someones society and companionship went down 6 5 million in one month
5740105 is there any evidence of that other than the plaintiffs doctors testimony
5740106 i wish we werent here but i believe the evidence was overwhelming based upon the experts who testified dr hinz met the standard of care hes a good doctor and we want this guy working
5740107 i think a lot of physicians given the climate of medical malpractice understand how unnecessary and how burdensome and crazy some of these cases can become

5740115 heading into this event we figured 15 of the 15 guys could possibly make finals jason was a little lucky to make the top eight but today we decided to go big and see how it goes he went big he was great the second element in his routine was the hardest of any athlete here today
5740116 a 41 wouldve made me really happy said burnett who owns the federation internationale de gymnastique competition record for dd at 17
5740117 the 40 7 was great but i knew it could be caught by the chinese
5740118 i remember him as a little kid in the gym watching matt turgeon 2000 olympic bronze medallist and jason saying thats cool
5740119 and matt remember used to hold the unofficial dd before jason took it from him
5740120 well the first time i sucked but i tried gymnastics and i was just better on the trampoline i guess it was the right choice
5740121 i think what was the most amazing thing marvelled cockburn joining in an impromptu celebration of family friends and teammates in the press mixed zone as burnett entered wearing his medal
5740122 for someone in his position he handled the pressure so so well

5740132 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
5740133 never mind that thomas already had been confirmed by the senate to three different positions including the u s court of appeals for the d c circuit the second most prestigious court in the land after the u s supreme court before he was nominated to the supreme court
5740134 never mind that he had accomplished all this after overcoming more personal adversity than any other sitting justice has endured sen obamas comment simply ignored facts and history
5740135 they reveal that obama is ignorant of facts and history misunderstands the constitution and contradicts himself in his own alleged criteria for supreme court nominees
5740136 first of all i think justice clarence thomas is one of the best appointments that have been made by republican presidents or any presidents for that matter in recent times
5740137 ill tell you why hes the only justice on the supreme court who prior to his appointment had recognized the relationship between the declaration of independence and the constitution that the constitution is a means of indicating the inalienable rights that are traceable to our creator
5740138 his is a tougher question only because i find him to be a very compelling person you know in conversation individually

5740199 the first seasons harvest has been so poor because of a long dry spell while heavy rains pests and diseases are destroying crops for the second season
5740200 we anticipate tougher periods for idps internally displaced persons and other people in months to come because the food quantity from the first season harvest was inadequate to feed them for the coming months as they await the second harvest that is being badly affected by the rain
5740201 i thought i would get seeds from the first seasons harvest for planting in the second season but there is virtually nothing the long dry season destroyed the beans maize millet and groundnuts that were maturing

5740231 es cierto que el consell ha hecho m s por entorpecer la aplicaci n de la ley que por agilizarla y seg n parece ha gastado fondos recibidos para estas prestaciones en otras cosas pero tambi n es cierto que las partidas presupuestarias para las ayudas que la ley establece como derechos no est n garantizadas por el gobierno
5740232 quiso apuntarse l s lo el xito de la ley de dependencia pero dej su aplicaci n pr ctica a expensas de la gesti n y la cofinanciaci n por parte de las comunidades aut nomas
5740233 la verdad es que la generalitat valenciana est a la cola en prestaciones reconocidas pero tampoco las comunidades con gobiernos del psoe han cubierto las expectativas
5740234 tener al frente de la generalitat un gobierno inepto en la gesti n y oportunista en la pol tica puesto que prefiere utilizar el tema de la dependencia para confrontar con el psoe en lugar de para beneficiar a las personas necesitadas
5740235 el esfuerzo de la conselleria por impulsar estos programas es evidente si tenemos en cuenta que en el curso 1998 99 eran 50 los centros que aplicaban este tipo de programas

5740331 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5740332 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5740333 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5740334 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5740335 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5740336 who are open to doing something on the production side
5740337 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5740338 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5740339 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5740340 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5740341 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5740342 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5740343 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5740344 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5740345 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5740346 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5740347 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5740348 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5740349 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5740350 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5740351 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5740352 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5740353 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5740354 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5740355 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5740356 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5740357 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5740358 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5740359 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5740360 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5740361 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5740362 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5740363 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5740364 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5740365 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5740366 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5740367 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5740368 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5740369 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5740370 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5740371 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5740372 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5740373 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5740374 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5740375 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5740376 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5740377 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5740378 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5740379 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5740380 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5740381 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5740382 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5740383 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5740384 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5740385 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5740386 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5740387 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5740388 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5740389 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5740390 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5740391 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5740392 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5740393 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5740394 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

5740400 its very difficult for the boxers especially asian boxers because their skills are based on technique
5740401 if he can get another one at this olympics it would mean a lot to the whole of
5740402 hopefully i can keep the fun rolling to the 2012 olympics in london
5740403 a lot of boxers want to go pro and win titles but for me the last three years have been all about winning a medal
5740404 everyone in prison will be sad as they watched me on the tv
5740405 no matter what our guys are going to win the gold
5740406 if people could have watched our practices they would have paid who knows how much to get in
5740407 for us the games were just an appetizer for the next days practice
5740408 i love the mix they have to this team it resembles our team
5740409 no one cares who gets credit for what no one cares how many minutes they play or how many points you score you check your egos at the door
5740410 did you interrupt my coffee just to ask me that question
5740411 hes earned it with his consistent play and he has the best mastery of the offense at this point
5740412 for 10 years while ive been training ive always had the games in a corner of my mind
5740413 thats a lot of sacrifices hours of training of being away from my family and then its a discipline that really only exists because of the olympic games so when it works its a huge thing
5740414 weve come up against a british team that is out of the ordinary
5740415 against hoy i gave everything i had in the first race and still he beat me
5740416 so i let it slide for the second because i knew that levy was beatable and i had a chance of bronze
5740417 we beat them easily only four months ago and now theyre untouchable
5740418 for 10 years while ive been training ive always had the games in a corner of my mind
5740419 thats a lot of sacrifices hours of training of being away from my family and then its a discipline that really only exists because of the olympic games so when it works its a huge thing
5740420 weve come up against a british team that is out of the ordinary
5740421 against hoy i gave everything i had in the first race and still he beat me
5740422 so i let it slide for the second because i knew that levy was beatable and i had a chance of bronze
5740423 we beat them easily only four months ago and now theyre untouchable
5740424 all of the supporters of spanish cycling said we had to raise the bar
5740425 competing in spain lots of the financial support from the authorities tends to come after the performances in the olympics so im going to be giving up quite a lot of money
5740426 but this is a decision i have taken with the family it has been carefully thought through and i have no plans to change that decision
5740427 perhaps its best to go out like this its a dream to retire at the top with a very nice taste in your mouth
5740428 one day last season i got home from practice and was totally starved
5740429 i went in the kitchen to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich but after i put the peanut butter on one slice of bread i realized i was out of jelly so i improvised i took some yellow mustard and ham and put that together with the peanut butter and it was like completely awesome
5740430 ham and mustard taste great together right and then when you get that peanut butter to level it off it just makes it so smooth
5740431 if its before noon i go with bacon instead of ham thats awesome too i know it sounds like it wouldnt be good but trust me youve got to try it
5740432 i dont try much that cooley comes up with and i cant imagine that being anything but bad
5740433 if i did try it id probably get food poisoned
5740434 no im not trying that crap its ridiculous just because you like peanut butter mustard and ham separately doesnt mean you should eat them in one sandwich some things arent meant to go together chris might try to convince himself it tastes good but if he really looked himself in the mirror hed admit that its some pretty nasty expletive
5740435 cudos to gonzo for sticking up for his diet and being able to play at such a high level for such a long time but eating fish and the occasional chicken dish does not make one a vegan or vegetarian for that matter still its very refreshing to see professional athletes talk about this im a vegetarian and constantly ridiculed for my dietary habits on the basketball court thanks for the article
5740436 why do you insist on calling t gonzalez a vegan when he clearly isnt vegans dont eat fish or chicken occasionally as a vegan i take offense call him what he is a half ass atarian
5740437 where did you get the term neo vegan its one of the most idiotic things ive heard this week im not vegan or vegetarian but i know stupid when i read it how about slightly dead or almost alive how about this more unique youre either fricken vegan or you arent if you eat animal products you arent vegan or vegetarian freakin idiots
5740438 first of all i have to commend you on your spectacular vernacular you are definitely a cunning linguist and a master debater so when did tony gonzalez become a leaf eater i have this article in an espn magazine that shows tony gonzalez grilling these monster t bones on the rooftop deck of his manhattan beach home did t gonz get a colon polyp or what i saw a t shirt in a shop on the boardwalk in venice last weekend that said guess what vegetarians plants have feelings too you should just not eat murderer how do you sleep at night tony do you hear the cries of the carrots
5740439 now that jared allen has publicly stated he wants to put his helmet into the middle of aaron rodgers spine we will find out if the commissioner reads your column if he does as he should there should be a warning forthcoming to allen from the nfl ivory tower
5740440 respect the writer he is all knowing and all powerful respect him actually i should say respect you since the e mail is addressed to you but you get the point and those minnesota linemen are mean
5740441 thanks for the inciteful article hopefully rodgers reads it and shreds the vikings porous secondary in week 1 obviously due to his remark allen is not quite rid of the juice while im not ignorant to the probability that most football players possess amped up levels of aggression and that it contributes to their success on the field i had to make that last low blow id respect much more if he did his talking after hed actually accomplished his job of stopping the packers running game and didnt lose 34 0 keep up the great work i enjoy your columns even when i disagree with them
5740442 im just wondering if favre fumbles the ball does a penalty lap and is cheered what is going to happen to him when he throws a backbreaking interception in an actual game i dont reward my dog for expletive on the carpet unless of course if once you become an icon your expletive no longer smells the jets fans really need to raise their standards
5740443 we must do a don julio shot for isaac hayes and one for stax records for good measure i thought you and your fathers song list was excellent although i would have substituted fortunate son for born on the bayou its as topical now as the day it was written
5740444 michael i always wondered where you got it but now i know it must be from your father i must say that your fathers taste in music is excellent and his selections pretty much mirror all of my own lets say top 50 songs of all time and the low spark of high heeled boys at no 1 perfect i actually listened to that song on the way to work this morning believe it or not which is what prompted me to write aah they dont make music like they used to anyway i just had to share i know its not sports related but i had to comment and p s i love your attention to spelling grammar and sentence structure and your willingness to point it out to your droves of readers im just a lowly product of the california state university system but even i appreciate it keep up the good work
5740445 michael ive been reading your comments alot lately and have a question why dont you get on the packers about how they handled this yes they both are wrong on how it was handled how do you know whos telling the truth or do you have a special gift to be able to tell when someone os telling the truth cause if you do you need to work for the police i think what should be done is sit all the parties down and hook them up to a lie detector and find out the real truth but that isnt going to happen one more thing you need to get your facts straight before you open your mouth just like all the sports writers
5740446 i am a yahoo sportsaholic and catch pretty much all of your columns and you do a great job but i must say that i am incredibly jealous that you helped write natalie coughlins book with coughlin there is finally a real reason for a guy in big 12 country to care about cal in the interviews ive seen ms coughlin seems so down to earth articulate and attentive on top of that that incredible smile and those dimples are just two of the many reasons that make her a gorgeous woman nothing against amanda beard who is pretty but shes not in natalies league is natalie as great of a gal as she seems to be if so clearly you have some connections plant a seed of doubt in her head about that dang fianc and put in a good word for me
5740447 yeah nat she did it again with all of the news that michael phelps gets it is nice to see some others get some print loved jason lezak banishing some demons katie hoff isnt dominating but she isnt embarrassing herself either however with all of the press that other 100m backstrokers were getting before the final race it was great to see our golden girl come through again lets hope she can do it in the 200 im also
5740448 michael i am sure that natalie coughlin will be getting a don julio call out for her impressive efforts in the pool this past week but whats with the swimming to the right of the lane on the backstroke i thought all you cal guys leaned left
5740449 im glad to see that the monkeys that snuck into your office and were writing your columns during the
5740450 oh yeah you screwed up milwaukee barely acknowledges burlingtons existence when i was growing up i got a lot more coverage in the chicago newspapers than i ever did in the milwaukee journal sentinel
5740451 logic said it could happen but the hard part is getting it on the day when it really counts
5740452 i try to go into a race with the frame of mind that i couldnt have trained harder whatever happens then is out of your hands
5740453 hes my sporting hero and i get to train with him nearly every day how lucky am i
5740454 i would be very surprised if people were doubting us
5740455 weve stepped up to a whole new level since the world championships but there are reasons for that
5740456 it seems more surprising that some nations have underperformed the gap has been exaggerated by some nations that havent raised their game
5740457 restaurants that invest strategically in energy efficiency can cut utility costs between 10 to 30 percent without sacrificing service quality style or comfort while making significant contributions to a cleaner environment
5740458 as an energy star partner we appreciate foodservicewarehouse coms efforts to promote energy star in the commercial kitchen and improve the environmental sustainability of restaurants
5740459 were at a crossroads in the foodservice industry where ecological concerns and operating cost concerns are perfectly aligned our end customers are searching for the most cost effective way to green their business and foodservicewarehouse coms program provides an excellent roadmap the going green program breaks it down into stages and truly simplifies the process
5740460 todays commercial kitchens are being squeezed by high operating costs driven by energy prices and a reduction in discretionary spending by consumers
5740461 our customers wanted a way to reduce their operating costs while becoming more ecologically responsible which in turn would make their establishment more appealing to patrons the program we developed allows our customers to achieve these goals while putting them further down the path toward other types of certifications

5740470 aku tulis dalam bahasa melayulah engkau menyemak dengan kamus bahasa inggeris tentulah salah semuanya
5740471 our aim is of course to qualify for the 2010 world cup but just because i am the coach that is no foregone conclusion
5740472 switzerland obviously doesnt have as large a pool of players as the bigger nations so we have to start well and hope the players stay in good form and play regularly for their clubs
5740473 i know how to deal with high expectations but i also know you can only hope to meet such expecations through a lot of hard work
5740474 i dont think many of our world cup qualifying opponents can say they have been to three straight major tournaments which shows that the work of koebi kuhn should not be taken for granted
5740475 wednesday will be a chance though for the players to show which of them can make the decisive steps ahead of our first qualifying match in israel and which other players offer us good alternatives
5740476 i think you might want to come smell your dogs
5740477 youve got no mercy i swear herb if you caught a hired man drinking out hed go and you wouldnt care if his family was starving
5740478 thats fine herb you always know whats best to do on the other fellows land plant this terrace that but you might say a slight different if the place was your own
5740479 have you some particular work in mind today cause we got a sick un the baby me and missis been up and down with her most the night i been thinking to carry her to doctor
5740480 an inch more of rain and this country would be paradise eden on earth
5740481 my husband cares more for the trees than he does for his children
5740482 herb was fit to be tied why the propeller hadnt stopped turning before hed slapped a lawsuit on the pilot
5740483 im not as poor as i look go ahead get all you can
5740484 shed your clothes put on a relaxed grin live like a rajah and have all the women you want for 50 a month
5740485 cozumel is a hold out against social economic and political pressure no official pushes any private person around on this island
5740486 every year flights of parrots come over from the mainland to lay their eggs
5740487 every time you see a mirror you go into a trance like like you was looking at some gorgeous piece of butt i mean my god dont you ever get tired
5740488 parrots dont sing talk maybe holler but they sure as hell dont sing
5740489 i told your daddy not to wake you up i said nancy must be tired after all that wonderful acting she did last night you were lovely dear those white ribbons in your hair and that part when you thought tom sawyer was dead you had real tears in your eyes good as anything on tv but your daddy said it was time you got up well it is going on for nine now what i wanted dear my little girl my little jolene shes just dying to bake a cherry pie and seeing how youre a champion cherry pie maker always winning prizes i wondered could i bring her over there this morning and you show her
5740490 mrs katz will you hold the line a moment please
5740491 and to begin tell why you were flirting with jerry roth
5740492 last night good grief i wasnt flirting you mean because we were holding hands he just came backstage during the show and i was so nervous so he held my hand to give me courage
5740493 bobby took me to the spook movie and we held hands
5740494 he didnt think so he just laughed but you know me boo and i fall off the seat
5740495 well daddy hes been in an awful mood the last three weeks awful at least around me and when i got home last night he started that again
5740496 that needed no amplification it was a subject that the two friends had discussed completely and upon which they agreed
5740497 you love bobby now and you need him but deep down even bobby knows there isnt any future in it later on when we go off to manhattan everything will seem a new world
5740498 everything will change whether you want it to or not but you cant change it now living here in holcomb seeing bobby everyday sitting in the same classes and theres no reason to because you and bobby are a very happy thing and it will be something happy to think back about if youre left alone cant you make your father understand that
5740499 whenever i start to say something he looks at me as though i must not love him or as though i loved him less and suddenly im tongue tied i just want to be his daughter and do as he wishes
5740500 im not sure its me thats making him grouchy something else hes really worried about something
5740501 well but were all so happy about mother you heard the wonderful news
5740502 sorry susie ive got to go mrs katz is here
5740503 knock knock excuse me sir weve been out hunting and lost our way if we could use the phone
5740504 i promise you honey well blast hair all over them walls

5740506 like we said i said wed be gone overnight said we was going to visit your sister in fort scott on account of she was holding money for you fifteen hundred dollars
5740507 nothing to do with you as such its just they dont like me seeing anybody from the walls
5740508 i sympathize with that theyre good people shes a real sweet person your mother
5740509 you go dear ill keep jolene company until her mother comes for her
5740510 goodness no i just love her to death well everybody does there isnt anybody like nancy do you know what mrs stringer says
5740511 one day she told the class nancy clutter is always in a hurry yet she always has time
5740512 all my children are very efficient they dont need me
5740513 im going to make one of these every day seven days a week
5740514 well you have all those little brothers and boys can eat a lot of pie mr clutter and kenyon i know they never get tired of them but the cook does nancy just turns up her nose itll be the same with you no no why do i say that
5740515 forgive me dear im sure youll never know what it is to be tired im sure youll always be happy
5740516 ive had some of these since i was a child daddy and mama all of us spent part of most years in california by the ocean and there was a shop that sold such precious little things these cups
5740517 daddy gave them to me i had a lovely childhood
5740518 instead she had met and married herb a college classmate of her oldest brother glenn actually since the two families lived within twenty miles of each other she had long known him by sight but the clutters plain farm people were not on visiting terms with the well to do and cultivated foxes
5740519 oh hes always headed somewhere washington and chicago and oklahoma and kansas city sometimes it seems like hes never home but wherever he goes he remembers how i dote on tiny things
5740520 he brought me this from san francisco it only cost a penny but isnt it pretty
5740521 they dont have to be left behind you can carry them in shoebox
5740522 why wherever you go you might be gone for a long time
5740523 or you might never go home and its important always to have with you something of your own thats really yours
5740524 im not hot im cold im freezing lord lord lord
5740525 ive been listening to you wilma all of you laughing having a good time im missing out on everything the best years the children everything a little while and even kenyon will be grown up a man and how will he remember me as a kind of ghost wilma
5740526 take ye heed watch and pray for ye know not when the time is
5740527 i have three boys who i will definitely take care of
5740528 but neither dicks physique nor the inky gallery adorning it made as remarkable an impression as his face which seemed composed of mismatching parts
5740529 it was true that the tightening action of a smile contracted his face into its correct proportions and made it possible to discern a less unnerving personality an american style
5740530 look all over the world and you wont find friendlier people or fresher air or sweeter drinking water
5740531 i could go to denver at triple the salary but ive got five kids and i figure theres no better place to raise kids than right here swell schools with every kind of sport we even have a junior college
5740532 now i have something to say concerning one of our adult members
5740533 you all know mrs hulco ashida know how the ashidas moved here from colorado started farming out to holcomb two years ago a fine family the kind of people holcombs lucky to have as anyone will tell you anyone who has been sick and had mrs ashida walk nobody can calculate how many miles to bring them some of the wonderful soups she makes or the flowers she grows where you wouldnt expect a flower could grow and last year at the county fair you will recall how much she contributed to the success of the 4 h exhibits so i want to suggest we honor mrs ashida with an award at our achievement banquet next tuesday
5740534 you know in most ways this is the best place weve ever lived hideo says the same we sure hate to think about leaving starting all over again
5740535 well herb the farm here the people were working for hideo thinks we could do better maybe in nebraska but nothings settled its just talk so far
5740536 me and the kids weve been saving up we want to give hideo something on the grand side for christmas what he needs is teeth now if your wife was to give you three gold teeth would that strike you as a wrong kind of present i mean asking a man to spend christmas in the dentists chair
5740537 you beat all dont ever try to get away from here well hogtie you
5740538 yes yes by all means gold teeth was me id be tickled
5740539 look herb at the banquet no speeches huh not for me you youre different the way you can stand up and talk to hundreds of people thousands and be so easy convince anybody about whatever just nothing scares you
5740540 i cant imagine you afraid no matter what happened youd talk your way out of it
5740541 what about my eye theyre all too light colored to hide that
5740542 get the bubbles out of your blood nothing can go wrong
5740543 theres him her the kid and the girl and maybe the other two but its saturday they might have guests lets count on eight or even twelve the only sure thing is everyone of them has got to go
5740544 seems like a lot of it to be so sure about
5740545 aint that what i promised you honey plenty of hair on them those walls
5740546 when youre my age youll feel different i used to think the same as you women so what but then you get to talking to some woman and its mighty nice youll see
5740547 oh kenyon its just that he lives in a world of his own
5740548 not unless its mr johnson dad said he was expecting him
5740549 your dad must be laying in a stack of it that cars been here id say three hours
5740550 do you think tracy will be able to talk by thanksgiving
5740551 it would thrill me to pieces to hear him say aunt nancy or uncle kenyon wouldnt you like to hear him say that i mean dont you love being an uncle kenyon good grief why cant you ever answer me
5740552 was the last i seen them nancy leading old babe off to the barn like i said nothing out of the ordinary
5740553 way above average intellectually perceptive as a well trained psychologist
5740554 you are a man of extreme passion a hungry man not quite sure where his appetite lies a deeply frustrated man striving to project his individuality against a backdrop of rigid conformity
5740555 will prove stronger than your strength and defeat you the flaw explosive emotional reaction out of all proportion to the occasion why why this unreasonable anger at the sight of others who are happy or content this growing contempt for people and the desire to hurt them all right you think theyre fools you despise them because their morals their happiness is the source of your frustration and resentment but these are dreadful enemies you carry within yourself in time destructive as bullets mercifully a bullet kills its victim this other bacteria permitted to age does not kill a man but leaves in its wake the hulk of a creature torn and twisted there is still fire within his being but it is kept alive by casting upon it faggots of scorn and hate he may successfully accumulate but he does not accumulate success for he is his own enemy and is kept from truly enjoying his achievements
5740556 friend p came out in august and after you left i met someone you do not know him but he put me on to something we could bring off beautiful a cinch the perfect score
5740557 you want not to give a damn to exist without responsibility without faith or friends or warmth
5740558 to fine opportunities a decent job and a home with some good people who are willing to help him
5740559 i dont believe you i think you went in there hung around a couple of minutes and came out
5740560 it was a puky idea what the hell would they have thought me barging in there like it was a god dam five n dime
5740561 maybe its just as well nuns are a bad luck bunch
5740562 thats the way i do business when those tax fellows come poking around canceled checks are your best friend
5740563 ive plenty to be grateful for wonderful things in my life
5740564 the kids weve been lucky there shouldnt say it but im real proud of them take kenyon right now he kind of leans toward being an engineer or a scientist but you cant tell me my boys not a born rancher god willing hell run this place someday you ever met eveannas husband don jarchow veterinarian i cant tell you how much i think of that boy vere too vere english the boy my girl beverly had the good sense to settle on if anything ever happened to me im sure i could trust those fellows to take responsibility bonnie by herself bonnie wouldnt be able to carry on an operation like this
5740565 youre a young man forty eight and from the looks of you from what the medical report tells us were likely to have you around a couple of weeks more
5740566 tell the truth i feel pretty good and pretty optimistic ive got an idea a man could make some real money around here the next few years
5740567 and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me i am his own and the joy we share as we tarry there none other has ever known
5740568 christ and they told me to keep away from kansas never set my pretty foot here again although they were barring me from heaven and just look at it just feast your eyes
5740569 remember dick all that talk about getting a boat i was thinking we could buy a boat in mexico something cheap but sturdy and we could go to japan sail right across the pacific been done thousands of people have done it im not conning you dick youd go for japan wonderful gentle people with manners like flowers really considerate not just out for your dough and the women youve never met a real woman
5740570 there are these baths one place called the dream pool you stretch out and beautiful knockout type girls come and scrub you head to toe
5740571 later lets talk about it later hell man ive got plenty on my mind
5740572 i came to the garden alone while the dew was still on the roses and the voice i hear falling on my ear the son of god discloses
5740573 there was a full moon and i thought maybe if nancy wanted to we might go for a drive drive out to mckinney lake
5740574 the phone rang once twice gosh i cant remember except that once the phone rang and mr clutter answered it in his office the door was open that sliding door between the living room and the office and i heard him say van so i knew he was talking to his partner mr van vleet and i heard him say that he had a headache but that it was getting better and said hed see mr van vleet on monday when he came back yes the mike hammer was just over five minutes of news then the weather report mr clutter always perked up when the weather report came on its all he ever really waited for like the only thing that interested me was the sports which came on next after the sports ended that was ten thirty and i got up to go nancy walked me out we talked a while and made a date to go to the movies sunday night a picture all the girls were looking forward to blue denim then she ran back in the house and i drove away it was as clear as day the moon was so bright and cold and kind of windy a lot of tumbleweed blowing about but thats all i saw only now when i think back i think somebody must have been hiding there maybe down among the trees somebody just waiting for me to leave

5740586 i called the house and let the phone ring at least i had the impression it was ringing oh a minute or more nobody answered so mr ewalt suggested that we go to the house and try to wake them up but when we got there i didnt want to do it go to the house i was frightened and i dont know why because it never occurred to me well something like that just doesnt but the sun was so bright everything looked too bright and quiet and then i saw that all the cars were there even kenyons old coyote wagon mr ewalt was wearing work clothes he had mud on his boots he felt he wasnt properly dressed to go calling on clutters especially since he never had been in the house i mean finally nancy said she would go with me we went around to the kitchen door and of course it wasnt locked the only person who ever locked doors around there was mrs helm the family never did we walked in and i saw right away that the clutters hadnt eaten breakfast there were no dishes nothing on the stove then i noticed something funny nancys purse it was lying on the floor sort of open we passed on through the dining room and stopped at the bottom of the stairs nancys room is just at the top i called her name and started up the stairs and nancy ewalt followed the sound of our footsteps frightened me more than anything they were so loud and everything else was so silent nancys door was open the curtains hadnt been drawn and the room was full of sunlight i dont remember screaming nancy ewalt says i did screamed and screamed i only remember nancys teddy bear staring at me and nancy and running
5740587 no she isnt and dont you say it dont you dare its only a nosebleed she has them all the time terrible nosebleed and thats all it is
5740588 theres too much blood theres blood on the walls you didnt really look
5740589 i thought maybe the child was hurt it seemed to me the first thing to do was call an ambulance miss kidwell susan she told me there was a telephone in the kitchen i found it right where she said but the receiver was off the hook and when i picked it up i saw the line had been cut
5740590 its the only way we can keep the kids pacified
5740591 the sheriff arrived it was nine thirty five i looked at my watch
5740592 well he said wendle did theres another one down here
5740593 yessir youve got to keep on your toes them trains come through here sometimes theyre going a hundred miles an hour the breeze alone why its enough to knock you down and when those mail sacks come flying out sakes alive its like playing tackle on a football team wham wham wham not that im complaining mind you its honest work government work and it keeps me young
5740594 most comfortable things you can put on your feet soft as a loon feather
5740595 time was wasnt anybody here wasnt my kin them days we called this place sherlock then along came this stranger by the name holcomb a hog raiser he was made money and decided the town ought to be called after him soon as it was what did he do sold out moved to california not us i was born here my children was born here and here we are
5740596 only dont go thinking thats how i got this position with the government myrt didnt even want me to have it but its a job you bid for goes to whoever puts in the lowest bid and i always do so low a caterpillar could peek over it ha ha that sure does rile the boys lots of boys would like to be mail messenger yessir but i dont know how much theyd like it when the snows high as old mr primo camera and the winds blowing blue hard and those sacks come sailing ugh wham
5740597 but the stamps work dont they anyhow what do i care back here in my part is real cozy ive got my rocker and a nice wood stove and a coffee pot and plenty to read
5740598 some of those bowlegged country boys you give em a little hooch and theyre like redskins want to scalp everything in sight course we only sold setups never the hard stuff itself wouldnt have even if it was legal my husband homer clare he didnt hold with it neither did i one day homer clare he passed on seven months and twelve days ago today after a five hour operation out in oregon he said to me myrt weve lived all our lives in hell now were going to die in heaven the next day we closed the dance hall ive never regretted it oh along at first i missed being a night owl the tunes the jollity but now that homers gone im just glad to do my work here at the federal building sit a spell drink a cup of coffee
5740599 but myrt if its only bonnie why would there be two ambulances
5740600 when you think how herb clutter spent his whole life in a hurry rushing in here to get his mail with never a minute to say good morning and thank you dog rushing around like a chicken with its head off joining clubs running everything getting jobs maybe other people wanted and now look its all caught up with him well he wont be rushing any more
5740601 because hes dead and bonnie too and nancy and the boy somebody shot them
5740602 the man in the airplane the one herb sued for crashing into his fruit trees if it wasnt him maybe it was you or somebody across the street all the neighbors are rattlesnakes varmints looking for a chance to slam the door in your face its the same the whole world over you know that
5740603 of what when your time comes it comes and tears wont save you
5740604 when homer died i used up all the fear i had in me and all the grief too if theres somebody loose around here that wants to cut my throat i wish him luck what difference does it make its all the same in eternity just remember if one bird carried every grain of sand grain by grain across the ocean by the time he got them all on the other side that would only be the beginning of eternity so blow your nose
5740605 a tragedy unbelievable and shocking beyond words struck four members of the herb clutter family late saturday night or early today
5740606 some people say im a tough old bird but the clutter business sure took the fly out of me
5740607 imagine anybody pulling a stunt like that time i heard it when everybody was pouring in here talking all kinds of wild eyed stuff my first thought was bonnie course it was silly but we didnt know the facts and a lot of people thought maybe on account of her spells now we dont know what to think it must have been a grudge killing done by somebody who knew the house inside out but who hated the clutters i never heard a word against them they were about as popular as a family can be and if something like this could happen to them then whos safe i ask you one old man sitting here that sunday he put his finger right on it the reason nobody can sleep he said all weve got out here are our friends there isnt anything else in a way thats the worst part of the crime what a terrible thing when neighbors cant look at each other without kind of wondering yes its a hard fact to live with but if they ever do find out who done it im sure itll be a bigger surprise than the murders themselves
5740608 was the first i heard of what had happened in holcomb i didnt believe it i couldnt afford to lord i had clutters check right here in my pocket a piece of paper worth eighty thousand dollars if what id heard was true but i thought it cant be there must be some mistake things like that dont happen you dont sell a man a big policy one minute and hes dead the next murdered meaning double indemnity i didnt know what to do i called the manager of our office in wichita told him how i had the check but hadnt put it through and asked what was his advice well it was a delicate situation it appeared that legally we werent obliged to pay but morally that was another matter naturally we decided to do the moral thing
5740609 if bobby just hears it he loved her we both did i have to be the one to tell him
5740610 hey bobby listen if were going somewhere why dont we go in the car
5740611 hey bobby listen they wont let you see her it wont do any good
5740612 it just shut you up the strangeness of it going out there where wed always had such a welcome
5740613 sheriff and all them fellas been out here finger printin and scratchin around they got good sense they understand how it was how come we didnt hear for one thing the wind a west wind like it was would carry the sound tother way another thing theres that big milo barn tween this house and ourn that old barn ud soak up a lotta racket fore it reached us and did you ever think of this him that done it he mustve knowed we wouldnt hear else he wouldnt have took the chance shootin off a shotgun four times in the middle of the night why hed be crazy course you might say he must be crazy anyhow to go doing what he did but my opinion him that done it had it figured out to the final t he knowed and theres one thing i know too me and the missis weve slept our last night on this place were movin out to a house alongside the highway
5740614 everything herb had he earned with the help of god he was a modest man but a proud man as he had a right to be he raised a fine family he made something of his life
5740615 but even if i hadnt known the family and liked them so well i wouldnt feel any different because ive seen some bad things i sure as hell have but nothing so vicious as this however long it takes it maybe the rest of my life im going to know what happened in that house the why and the who
5740616 now the big fact here the thing to remember is were not dealing with one murder but four and we dont know which of the four was the main target the primary victim it could have been nancy or kenyon or either of their parents some people say well it must have been mr clutter because his throat was cut he was the most abused but thats theory not fact it would help if we knew in what order the family died but the coroner cant tell us that he only knows the murders happened sometime between eleven p m saturday and two a m sunday
5740617 if herb had thought his family was in danger mortal danger he would have fought like a tiger and herb was no ninny a strong guy in top condition kenyon too big as his dad bigger a big shouldered boy its hard to see how one man armed or not could have handled the two of them
5740618 how two individuals could reach the same degree of rage the kind of psychopathic rage it took to commit such a crime
5740619 assuming murderer was someone known to the family a member of this community assuming that he was an ordinary man ordinary except that he had a quirk an insane grudge against the clutters or of the clutters where did he find a partner someone crazy enough to help him it doesnt add up it doesnt make sense but then come right down to it nothing does
5740620 as a matter of fact one of the photographs a close up of mr
5740621 jolene k came over and i showed her how to make a cherry pie practiced with roxie bobby here and we watched tv left at eleven
5740622 but none of the persons he questioned and none of the questions he asked
5740623 of all the people in all the world the clutters were the least likely to be murdered
5740624 every time i think of that bastard my hands start to twitch i just want to choke him
5740625 one of those maybe thats our deal a personal thing a grudge that got out of hand
5740626 the whole setup has that robbery smell what about clutters wallet someone left it open and empty on clutters bed i dont think it was the owner and nancys purse the purse was lying on the kitchen floor how did it get there yes and not a dime in the house well two dollars we found two dollars in an envelope on nancys desk and we know clutter cashed a check for sixty bucks just the day before we figure there ought to have been at least fifty of that left so some say nobody would kill four people for fifty bucks and say sure maybe the killer did take the money but just to try and mislead us make us think robbery was the reason i wonder
5740627 only when you come home tonight youll have to ring the bell ive had all the locks changed
5740628 dont worry honey just lock the doors and turn on the porch light
5740629 a lily livered lot shaking in their boots afraid to shut their eyes
5740630 this old girl shes sleeping good as ever anybody wants to play a trick on me let em try
5740631 locks and bolts are the fastest going item folks aint particular what brand they buy they just want them to hold
5740632 feeling wouldnt run half so high if this had happened to anyone except the clutters anyone less admired prosperous secure but that family represented everything people hereabouts really value and respect and that such a thing could happen to them well its like being told there is no god it makes life seem pointless i dont think people are so much frightened as they are deeply depressed
5740633 when this is cleared up ill wager whoever did it was someone within ten miles of where we now stand
5740634 ive always played my hunches thats why im alive today you know willie jay he said i was a natural born medium and he knew about things like that he was interested he said i had a high degree of extrasensory perception sort of like having built in radar you see things before you see them the outlines of coming events take like my brother and his wife jimmy and his wife they were crazy about each other but he was jealous as hell and he made her so miserable being jealous and always thinking she was passing it out behind his back that she shot herself and the next day jimmy put a bullet through his head when it happened this was 1949 and i was in alaska with dad up around circle city i told dad jimmys dead a week later we got the news lords truth another time over in japan i was helping load a ship and i sat down to rest a minute suddenly a voice inside me said jump i jumped i guess maybe ten feet and just then right where id been sitting a ton of stuff came crashing down i could give you a hundred examples i dont care if you believe me or not for instance right before i had my motorcycle accident i saw the whole thing happen saw it in my mind the rain the skid tracks me lying there bleeding and my legs broken thats what ive got now a premonition something tells me this is a trap
5740635 aw come on baby get the bubbles out of your blood we scored it was perfect
5740636 but on the whole it was perfect we hit the ball right out of park its lost and its gonna stay lost there isnt a single connection
5740637 if we get caught lets get caught together then we can back each other up when they start pulling the confession crap saying you said and i said
5740638 itd be worth it like if i was nabbed on a check charge itd be worth it just to get back in there
5740639 about that premonition stuff tell me this if you were so damn sure you were gonna crack up why didnt you call it quits it wouldnt have happened if youd stayed off your bike right
5740640 im a normal i only dream about blond chicken speaking of which you hear about the nanny goats nightmare
5740641 nancy loved the river summer nights we used to ride double on nancys horse babe that old fat gray ride straight to the river and right into the water then babe would wade along in the shallow part while we played our flutes and sang got cool i keep wondering gosh what will become of her babe a lady from garden city took kenyons dog took teddy he ran away found his way back to holcomb but she came and got him again and i have nancys cat evinrude but babe i suppose theyll sell her wouldnt nancy hate that wouldnt she be furious another day the day before the funeral bobby and i were sitting by the railroad tracks watching the trains go by real stupid like sheep in a blizzard when suddenly bobby woke up and said we ought to go see nancy we ought to be with her so we drove to garden city went to the phillip v funeral home there on main street i think bobbys kid brother was with us yes im sure he was because i remember we picked him up after school and i remember he said how there wasnt going to be any school the next day so all the holcomb kids could go to the funeral and he kept telling us what the kids thought he said the kids were convinced it was the work of a hired killer i didnt want to hear about it just gossip and talk everything nancy despised anyway i dont much care who did it somehow it seems beside the point my friend is gone knowing who killed her isnt going to bring her back what else matters they wouldnt let us at the funeral parlor i mean they said no one could view the family except the relatives but bobby insisted and finally the undertaker he knew bobby and i guess felt sorry for him he said all right be quiet about it but come on in now i wish we hadnt
5740642 across the street a man was raking leaves i kept looking at him because i didnt want to close my eyes i thought if i do ill faint so i watched him rake leaves and burn them watched without really seeing him because all i could see was the dress i knew it so well i helped her pick the material it was her own design and she sewed it herself i remember how excited she was the first time she wore it at a party all i could see was nancys red velvet and nancy in it dancing
5740643 a thousand persons the largest crowd in the five year history of the first methodist church attended services for the four victims today several classmates of nancys from holcomb high school wept as the reverend leonard cowan said god offers us courage love and hope even though we walk through the shadows of the valley of death im sure he was with them in their last hours jesus has never promised us we would not suffer pain or sorrow but he has always said he would be there to help us bear the sorrow and the pain on the unseasonably warm day about six hundred persons went to the valley view cemetery on the north edge of this city there at graveside services they recited the lords prayer their voices massed together in a low whisper could be heard throughout the cemetery
5740644 like the clerk in the kansas city missouri clothing store the first of the places dick had decided to
5740645 for the task proposed it seemed dick had perfect pitch
5740646 after commenting on the customers oddly proportioned figure the oversized torso supported by the undersized legs he added
5740647 in miami beach they got reservations a present from her folks two weeks at forty bucks a day how about that an ugly runt like him hes making it with a honey shes not only built but loaded while guys like you and me good lookin guys
5740648 so youre going to get married next week well youll need a ring
5740649 easiest thing to hock or sell cameras and tv sets
5740650 what about dad i feel oh jesus hes such a good old guy and my mother well you saw her what about them me ill be off in mexico or wherever but theyll be right here when those checks start to bounce i know dad hell want to make them good like he tried to before and he cant hes old and hes sick he aint got anything
5740651 we can pay off the checks once were in mexico once we get started down there well make money lots of it
5740652 you get paid five hundred bucks a trip or so perry had read somewhere
5740653 this is authentic ive got a map ive got the whole history it was buried there back in 1821 peruvian bullion jewelry sixty million dollars thats what they say its worth even if we didnt find all of it even if we found only some of it are you with me dick
5740654 alvin now ive known you since you were a boy
5740655 this may be something may not but a bartender here says he over heard two fellows discussing the case in terms made it sound like they had a lot to do with it
5740656 im not going to tell you anything not till i get the reward you send the reward then ill tell you who i am thats final
5740657 alvin are you lighting another cigarette honestly alvin cant you at least try to sleep
5740658 it all adds up to a nice round number zero
5740659 something here is wrong i feel it i know it but i dont know what it is
5740660 to accept it would obliterate his image of the killer or rather killers
5740661 something fussy and soft those bedcovers now what kind of person would do that tie up two women the way bonnie and the girl were tied and then draw up the bedcovers tuck them in like sweet dreams and good night or the pillow under kenyons head at first i thought maybe the pillow was put there to make his head a simpler target now i think no it was done for the same reason the mattress box was spread on the floor to make the victim more comfortable
5740662 we have to keep going till we know the clutters better than they ever knew themselves until we see the connection between what we found last sunday morning and something that happened maybe five years ago the link got to be one got to
5740663 you take it easy now and tomorrow ill teach you to play poker
5740664 i want to remember bonnie the way bonnie was and all of them
5740665 alvin do you think well ever get back to normal living
5740666 when alvin was sheriff i know some of the boys teased him
5740667 i dont see how anyone can sit down to table without wanting to bless it
5740668 sometimes when i come home from work well im tired but theres always coffee on the stove and sometimes a steak in the icebox the boys make a fire to cook the steak and we talk and tell each other our day and by the time suppers ready i know we have good cause to be happy and grateful so i say thank you lord not just because i should because i want to
5740669 alvin answer me do you think well ever have a normal life again
5740670 vere and beverly had planned to be married at christmas time the invitations were printed and her father had reserved the church for that date due to the unexpected tragedy and because of the many relatives being here from distant places the young couple decided to have their wedding saturday
5740671 there is much resentment in this community that is garden city
5740672 i have even heard on more than one occasion that the man when found should be hanged from the nearest tree let us not feel this way the deed is done and taking another life cannot change it instead let us forgive as god would have us do it is not right that we should hold a grudge in our hearts the doer of this act is going to find it very difficult indeed to live with himself his only peace of mind will be when he goes to god for forgiveness let us not stand in the way but instead give prayers that he may find his peace
5740673 theres got to be something wrong with somebody whod do a thing like that
5740674 sit for hours just sucking his thumb and poring over them phony damn treasure guides
5740675 he might be ready to kill you but youd never know it not to look at or listen to
5740676 way way rock bottom i never thought i could do it a thing like that
5740677 sure i did only a nigger its not the same
5740678 know what it is that really bugs me about the other thing its just i dont believe it that anyone can get away with a thing like that because i dont see how its possible to do what we did and just one hundred percent get away with it i mean thats what bugs me i cant get it out of my head that somethings got to happen
5740679 honest to god going to get away with doing a thing like that
5740680 oh no oh please no no no no dont oh please dont please
5740681 if shed ever had any luck at all with her looks and all she could have got somewhere been somebody
5740682 way way rock bottom i never thought i could do it
5740683 and at once he recognized his error dick would of course answer by asking
5740684 as you wait in a dentists office or a railway station try studying the give away signs in people around you
5740685 ive always been an outstanding character detective otherwise id be dead today
5740686 and perry saw as he went on that dick was interested he was really listening
5740687 it was a couple of summers ago out in vegas i was living in this old boarding house it used to be a fancy cathouse but all the fancy was gone it was a place they should have torn down ten years back anyway it was sort of coming down by itself the cheapest rooms were in the attic and i lived up there so did this nigger his name was king he was a transient we were the only two up there us and a million cucarachas king he wasnt too young but hed done roadwork and other outdoor stuff he had a good build he wore glasses and he read a lot he never shut his door time i passed by he was always lying there buck naked was out of work and said hed saved a few dollars from his job said he wanted to stay in bed awhile read and fan himself and drink beer the stuff he read it was just junk comic books and cowboy junk he was o k sometimes wed have a beer together and once he lent me ten dollars i had no cause to hurt him but one night we were sitting in the attic it was so hot you couldnt sleep so i said come on king lets go for a drive i had an old car id stripped and souped and painted silver the silver ghost i called it we went for a long drive drove way out in the desert out there it was cool we parked and drank a few more beers king got out of the car and i followed after him he didnt see id picked up this chain a bicycle chain i kept under the seat actually i had no real idea to do it till i did it i hit him across the face broke his glasses i kept right on afterward i didnt feel a thing i left him there and never heard a word about it maybe nobody ever found him just buzzards
5740688 sure i did only a nigger its not the same
5740689 know what it is that really bugs me about that other thing its just i dont believe it that anyone can get away with a thing like that
5740690 since the trouble started weve been doing all the business we can handle
5740691 if it was spring and work to be done they wouldnt be here but wheats winters on the way they got nothing to do but sit around and scare each other you know bill brown down to the telegram see the editorial he wrote that one he called it another crime said its time for everyone to stop wagging loose tongues because thats a crime too telling plain out lies but what can you expect look around you rattlesnakes varmints rumor mongers see anything else ha like dash you do
5740692 got to nowhere else for them to go less they drive seven miles one direction or fifteen the other anyway we run a friendly place and the coffees good since mable came to work
5740693 after the tragedy i said mabel now that youre out of a job why dont you come give me a hand at the cafe cook a little wait counter how it turned out the only bad feature is everybody comes in here they pester her with questions about the tragedy but mabels not like cousin myrt or me shes shy besides she doesnt know anything special no more than anybody else
5740694 anybody reads the papers knows as much as i do more because i dont read them
5740695 taxes my dear death duties enormous criminal death duties thats what drove us out of england yes we left a year ago without regrets none we love it here just adore it though of course its very different from our other life the life weve always known paris and rome monte london i do occasionally think of london oh i dont really miss it the frenzy and never a cab and always worrying how one looks positively not we love it here i suppose some people those aware of our past the life weve led wonder arent we the tiniest bit lonely out there in the wheat fields out west is where we meant to settle wyoming or neveda la vraie chose we hoped when we got there some oil might stick to us but on our way we stopped to visit friends in garden city friends of friends actually but they couldnt have been kinder insisted we linger on and we thought well why not why not hire a bit of land and start ranching or farming which is a decision we still havent come to whether to ranch or farm dr austin asked if we didnt find it perhaps too quiet actually no actually ive never known such bedlam its noisier than a bomb raid train whistles coyotes monsters howling the bloody night long a horrid racket and since the murders it seems to bother me more so many things do our house what an old creaker it is mark you im not complaining really its quite a serviceable house has all the mod cons but oh how it coughs and grunts and after dark when the wind commences that hateful prairie wind one hears the most appalling moans i mean if ones a bit nervy one cant help imagining silly things dear god that poor family no we never met them i saw mr clutter once in the federal building
5740696 i had my self a talk with mr mccoy tried to let him know whats going on out here in holcomb and here abouts how a body cant sleep my wife cant sleep and she wont allow me so i told mr mccoy i like his place fine but he better hunt up another man count if were movin on down to east colorado maybe then ill get some rest

5740705 funny but you know bess ill bet he wasnt afraid i mean however it happened ill bet right up to the last he didnt believe it would because it couldnt not to him

5740715 i was terribly sure trees and flowers were the same as birds or people
5740716 my eyes arent too good and i wondered if they had played me a trick
5740717 out walked a person no one present had ever seen before a man in his middle thirties dull eyed wild haired and wearing a hip holster stocked with a
5740718 i guess all of us there had the identical idea this was him the one who came and killed them
5740719 he didnt make a move stood quiet kind of blinking they took the gun away and started asking questions
5740720 somebody asked him was he a hitchhiker hitchhiking his way to new mexico no he said he was driving his own car and it was parked down the lane a piece so everybody went to look at the car when they found what was inside it one of the men maybe it was al dewey said to him told this jonathan daniel adrian well mister seems like weve got something to discuss because inside the car what theyd found was a 12 gauge shotgun and a hunting knife

5740726 i let her go and said goodby as she took the car and left me behind this was during depression my children all cryed at the top of their voices she only cursed them saying they would run away to come to me later
5740727 i was always thinking about dad hoping he could come take me away and i remember like as second ago the time i saw him again standing in the schoolyard it was like when the ball hits the bat really solid di maggio only dad wouldnt help me told me to be good and hugged me and went away it was not long afterward my mother put me to stay in a catholic orphanage the one where the black widows were always at me hitting me because of wetting the bed which is one reason i have an aversion to nuns and god and religion but later on i found there are people even more evil because after a couple of months they tossed me out of the orphanage and she his mother put me some place worse a childrens shelter operated by the salvation army they hated me too for wetting the bed and being half indian there was this one nurse she used to call me nigger and say there wasnt any difference between niggers and indians oh jesus was she an evil bastard incarnate what she used to do shed fill a tub with ice cold water put me in it and hold me under till i was blue nearly drowned but she got found out the bitch because i caught pneumonia i almost conked i was in the hospital two months it was while i was so sick that dad came back when i got well he took me away
5740728 which was the finish i never went back because that summer dad built a primitive sort of trailer what he called a house car it had two bunks and a little cooking galley the stove was good you could cook anything on it baked our own bread i used to put up preserves pickled apples crab apple jelly anyway for the next six years we shifted around the country never stayed nowhere too long when we stayed some place too long people would begin to look at dad act like he was a character and i hated that it hurt me because i loved dad then even though he could be rough on me bossy as hell but i loved dad then so i was always glad when we moved on
5740729 dad and i slept hugged together rolled up in blankets and bearskins morning before daylight id hustle our breakfast biscuits and syrup fried meat and off we went to scratch a living it would have been o k if only i hadnt grown up the older i got the less i was able to appreciate dad he knew everything one way but he didnt know anything another way whole sections of me dad was ignorant of didnt understand an iota of like i could play a harmonica first time i picked one up guitar too i had this great natural musical ability which dad didnt recognize or care about i liked to read too improve my vocabulary make up songs and i could draw but i never got any encouragement from him or anybody else nights i used to lie awake trying to control my bladder partly and partly because i couldnt stop thinking always when it was too cold hardly to breathe id think about hawaii about a movie id seen with dorothy lamour i wanted to go there where the sun was and all you wore was grass and flowers
5740730 but i never would have joined if id known what i was going up against
5740731 i never minded the work and i liked being a sailor seaports and all that but the queens on ship wouldnt leave me alone a sixteen year old kid and a small kid i could handle myself sure but a lot of queens arent effeminate you know hell ive known queens could toss a pool table out the window and the piano after it those kind of girls they can give you an evil time especially when theres a couple of them they get together and gang up on you and youre just a kid it can make you practically want to kill yourself years later when i went into the army when i was stationed in korea the same problem came up i had a good record in the army good as anybody they gave me the bronze star but i never got promoted after four years and fighting through the whole goddam korean war i ought at least to have made corporal but i never did know why because the sergeant we had was tough because i wouldnt roll over jesus i hate that stuff i cant stand it though i dont know some queers ive really liked as long as they didnt try anything the most worth while friend i ever had really sensitive and intelligent he turned out to be queer
5740732 wrote me he had bought some land on the highway outside anchorage said he was going to have a hunting lodge a place for tourists trappers den lodge that was to be the name and asked me to hurry on up there and help him build it he was sure wed make a fortune well while i was still in the army stationed at fort lewis washington id bought a motorcycle murdercycles they ought to call them and as soon as i got discharged i headed for alaska got as far as bellingham up there on the border it was raining my bike went into a skid
5740733 joe james he and his wife befriended me the difference in our age was only two or three years but they took me into their home and treated me like i was one of their kids which was o k because they took trouble with their kids and liked them at the time they had four the number finally went to seven they were very good to me joe and his family i was on crutches i was pretty helpless just had to sit around so to give me something to do try to make myself useful i started what became a sort of school the pupils were joes kids along with some of their friends and we held classes in the parlor i was teaching harmonica and guitar drawing and penmanship everybody always remarks what a beautiful handwriting i have i do and its because once i bought a book on the subject and practiced till i could write same as in the book also we used to read stories the kids did each one in turn and id correct them as we went along it was fun i like kids little kids and that was a nice time but then the spring came it hurt me to walk but i could walk and dad was still waiting for me
5740734 but he didnt commence to build till i got there

5740775 sort of drifting around the country taking jobs as they came
5740776 one way and another i found myself out there in western kansas
5740777 i dont exactly recall how mr clutter first got mentioned it must have been when we were discussing jobs different kinds of work wed done dick he was a trained car mechanic and mostly that was the work hed done only once hed had a job driving a hospital ambulance he was full of brag about that about nurses and all what hed done with them in the back of the ambulance anyway i informed him how id worked a year on a considerable wheat spread in western kansas for mr clutter he wanted to know if mr clutter was a wealthy man yes i said yes he was in fact i said mr clutter had once told me that he got rid often thousand dollars in one week i mean said it sometimes cost him ten thousand dollars a week to run his operation after that dick never stopped asking me about the family how many was they what ages would the kids be now exactly how did you get to the house how was it laid out did mr clutter keep a safe i wont deny it i told him he did because i seemed to remember a sort of cabinet or safe or something right behind the desk in the room mr clutter used as an office next thing i knew dick was talking about killing mr clutter said him and perry was gonna go out there and rob the place and they was gonna kill all witnesses the clutters and anybody else that happened to be around he described to me a dozen times how he was gonna do it how him and perry was gonna tie them people up and gun them down i told him dick youll never get by with it but i cant honestly say i tried to persuade him different because i never for a minute believed he meant to carry it out i thought it was just talk like you hear plenty of in lansing thats about all you do hear what a fellows gonna do when he gets out the holdups and robberies and so forth its nothing but brag mostly nobody takes it serious thats why when i heard what i heard on the earphones well i didnt hardly believe it still and all it happened just like dick said it would
5740778 a particular friend a catholic kind of very religious he asked me well what are you gonna do floyd i said well i didnt rightly know what did he think i ought to do well he was all for me going to the proper people said he didnt think i ought to live with something like on my mind and he said i could do it without anybody inside guessing i was the one told said hed fix it so the next day he got word to the deputy warden told him i wanted to be called out
5740779 the person to whom warden hand telephoned was logan sanford
5740780 funny the past three weeks thats the angle weve concentrated on tracking down every man who ever worked on the clutter place now the way its turned out it just seems like a piece of luck but a few days more and we wouldve hit this wells found he was in prison we wouldve got the truth then hell yes
5740781 i hope you find him mr nye for his own sake we have two sons and hes one of them our first born we love him but oh i realized i realized he wouldnt have packed up run off without a word to anybody his daddy or his brother unless he was in trouble again what makes him do it why
5740782 an outstanding athlete always on the first team at school basketball baseball football dick was always the star player a pretty good student too with a marks in several subjects history mechanical drawing after he graduated from high school june 1949 he wanted to go on to college study to be an engineer but we couldnt do it plain didnt have the money never have had any money our farm here its only forty four acres we hardly can scratch a living i guess dick resented it not getting to college the first job he had was with santa fe railways in kansas city made seventy five dollars a week he figured that was enough to get married on so him and carol got married she wasnt but sixteen he wasnt but nineteen hisself i never thought nothing good would come of it didnt neither
5740783 three precious little boys our grandchildren there thats what came of it and carol is a lovely girl shes not to blame
5740784 him and carol rented a good size house bought a fancy car they was in debt all the time even though pretty soon dick was making better money driving a hospital ambulance later on the mark buick company a big outfit there in kansas city they hired him as a mechanic and car painter but him and carol lived too high kept buying stuff they couldnt no how afford and dick got to writing checks i still think the reason he started doing stunts such as that was connected with the smash up concussed his head in a car smash up after that he wasnt the same boy gambling writing bad checks i never knew him to do them things before and it was along about then he took up with this other gal the one he divorced carol for and was his second wife
5740785 dick couldnt help that you remember how margaret edna was attracted to him
5740786 cause a woman likes you does that mean you got to get caught
5740787 well mr nye i expect you know as much about it as we do why our boy was sent to prison locked away seventeen months and all he done was borrow a hunting rifle from the house of a neighbor here he had no idea to steal it i dont give a damn what nobody says and that was the ruination of him when he came out of lansing he was a plain stranger to me you couldnt talk to him the whole world was against dick hickock thats how he figured even the second wife she left him filed for divorce while he was in prison just the same lately there he seemed to be settling down working for the bob sands body shop over in olathe living here at home with us getting to bed early not violating his parole any shape or fashion ill tell you mr nye ive not got long im with cancer and dick knowed that least ways he knowed im sickly and not a month ago right before he took off he told me dad youve been a pretty good old dad to me im not ever gonna do nothing more to hurt you he meant it too that boy has plenty of good inside him if ever you seen him on a football field if ever you seen him play with his children you wouldnt doubt me lord i wish the lord could tell me because i dont know what happened
5740788 from august until well i never saw him after the nineteenth of november or maybe it was the twentieth he left without giving me any notice whatever just took off i dont know where to and neither does his dad surprised well yes yes i was we were on a fairly friendly basis dick kind of has a way with him you know he can be very likable once in a while he used to come to our house fact is a week before he left we had some people over a little party and dick brought this friend he had visiting him a boy from nevada perry smith was his name he could play the guitar real nice he played the guitar and sang some songs and him and dick entertained everybody with a weight lifting act perry smith hes a little fellow not much over five feet high but he could just about pick up a horse no they didnt seem nervous neither one id say they were enjoying themselves the exact date sure i remember it was the thirteenth friday the thirteenth of november
5740789 dick hickock dont talk to me about dick hickock if ever i met the devil steal steal the weights off a dead mans eyes his mother though eunice shes a fine woman heart big as a barn his daddy too both of them plain honest people dick wouldve gone to jail more times than you can count except nobody around here ever wanted to prosecute out of respect for his folks
5740790 dick brought him perry home one evening and told us he was a friend just off a bus from las vegas and he wanted to know couldnt he sleep here stay here awhile
5740791 no sir i wouldnt have him in the house one look and i saw what he was with his perfume and his oily hair it was clear as day where dick had met him according to the conditions of his parole he wasnt supposed to associate with anybody hed met up there lansing i warned dick but he wouldnt listen he found a room for his friend at the hotel olathe in olathe and after that dick was with him every spare minute once they went off on a weekend trip mr nye certain as im sitting here perry smith was the one put him up to writing them checks
5740792 the way i understood it perry smith has a sister lives in fort scott she was supposed to be holding a piece of money belonged to him fifteen hundred dollars was the sum mentioned that was the main reason hed come to kansas to collect this money his sister was holding so dick drove him down there to get it it was only a overnight trip he was back home a little before noon sunday time for sunday dinner
5740793 an overnight trip which means they left here sometime saturday that would be saturday november fourteenth
5740794 on sunday when your son came home was he alone or was perry smith with him
5740795 no he was alone he said hed left perry off at the hotel olathe
5740796 and do you remember did anything in his manner strike you as unusual different
5740797 he seemed the same as ever soon as he came in we sat down to dinner he was mighty hungry started piling his plate before id finished the blessing i remarked on it said dick youre shoveling it in as fast as you can work your elbow dont you mean to leave nothing for the rest of us course hes always been a big eater pickles he can eat a whole tub of pickles
5740798 fell fast asleep and i guess you could say that was unusual wed gathered round to watch a basketball game on the tv me and dick and our other boy david pretty soon dick was snoring like a buzz saw and i said to his brother lord i never thought id live to see the day dick would go to sleep at a basketball game did though slept straight through it only woke up long enough to eat some cold supper and right after went off to bed
5740799 thats his gun dicks him and david go out once in a while after rabbits mostly
5740800 that gun cost me over a hundred dollars dick bought it on credit and now the store wont have it back even though its not hardly a month old and only been used the one time the start of november when him and david went to grinnell on a pheasant shoot he used ours names to buy it his daddy let him so here we are liable for the payments and when you think of walter sick as he is and all the things we need all we do without
5740801 are you sure you wont have a cup of coffee mr nye its no trouble
5740802 thank you but its late and i have to drive to topeka
5740803 now ill just run through this see if i have it straight perry smith arrived in kansas thursday the twelfth of november your son claimed this person came here to collect a sum of money from a sister residing in fort scott that saturday the two drove to fort scott where they remained overnight i assume in the home of the sister
5740804 no they never could find her seems like shed moved
5740805 nevertheless they stayed away overnight and during the week that followed that is from the fifteenth to the twenty first dick continued to see his friend perry smith but otherwise or as far as you know he maintained a normal routine lived at home and reported to work every day on the twenty first he disappeared and so did perry smith and since then youve not heard from him he hasnt written you
5740806 of what hes done of how hes hurt us again and afraid because he thinks we wont forgive him like we always have i and will you have children mr nye
5740807 one thing more have you any idea any at all where your son might have gone
5740808 thank you sir omahas where we were headed hoped we might find some work
5740809 we always wanted to go back but its hard to move around when youve got five kids

5740830 the guys out of a book he calls himself the lone wolf a lot of his mail comes addressed that way the lone wolf he doesnt receive many letters no but bales of catalogues and advertising pamphlets youd be surprised the number of people send away for that stuff just to get some mail must be how old id say sixty dresses western cowboy boots and a big ten gallon hat he told me he used to be with the rodeo ive talked to him quite a bit hes been in here almost every day the last few years once in a while hed disappear stay away a month or so always claimed hed been off prospecting one day last august a young man came here to the window he said he was looking for his father tex john smith and did i know where he could find him he didnt look much like his dad the wolf is so thin lipped and irish and this boy looked almost pure indian hair black as boot polish with eyes to match but next morning in walks the wolf and confirms it he told me his son had just got out of the army and that they were going to alaska hes an old alaska hand i think he once owned a hotel there or some kind of hunting lodge he said he expected to be gone about two years nope never seen him since him or his boy
5740831 my name is nye this is inspector guthrie were attached to the san francisco police and weve just received an inquiry from kansas concerning your brother perry edward smith it seems he hasnt been reporting to his parole officer and we wondered if you could tell us anything of his present whereabouts
5740832 i havent seen perry in four years or heard from him since he was paroled last summer when he came out of prison he visited my father in reno in a letter my father told me he was returning to atlanta and taking perry with him then he wrote again i think in september and he was very angry he and perry had quarreled and separated before they reached the border perry turned back my father went on to alaska alone
5740833 then its possible your brother may have joined him recently within the last month
5740834 but while he was in lansing you wrote him frequently or so the kansas authorities tell us
5740835 i wanted to help him i hoped i might change a few of his ideas now i know better the rights of other people mean nothing to perry he has no respect for anyone
5740836 about friends do you know of any with whom he might be staying
5740837 he said he was in trouble and asked if i would take care of his wife until he could send for her the girl looked twenty it turned out she was fourteen and of course she wasnt anyones wife but at the time i was taken in i felt sorry for her and asked her to stay with us she did though not for long less than a week and when she left she took our suitcases and everything they could hold most of my clothes and most of my husbands the silver even the kitchen clock
5740838 you understand mrs johnson were working on the assumption that your brother will contact you write or call or come to see you
5740839 i hope not as a matter of fact he doesnt know weve moved he thinks im still in denver please if you do find him dont give him my address im afraid
5740840 when you say that is it because you think he might harm you hurt you physically

5740845 im so cold i wouldnt give a damn if this caught fire and burned me alive
5740846 hang a lot of hot paper hell i know weve got to be careful i know theyve got a warrant out because of the paper we hung before but well move fast one day thatll do it if we grab enough maybe we ought to try florida spend christmas in miami stay the winter if it looks good
5740847 what is it honey that other deal why the hell cant you forget it they never made any connection they never will
5740848 you could be wrong and if you are it means the corner
5740849 but were pretty sure this is it we all think so if we didnt we wouldnt have set up a seventeen state alarm from arkansas to oregon but keep in mind it could be years before we catch them they may have separated or left the country theres a chance theyve gone to alaska not hard to get lost in alaska the longer theyre free the less of a case well have frankly as matters stand we dont have much of a case anyhow we could nab those sonsabitches tomorrow and never be able to prove spit
5740850 thats my opinion and thats why we cant be too cautious they think theyve got away with it well we dont want them to know any different the safer they feel the sooner well grab them
5740851 seems there was a man who worked for herb way back yonder around 47 or 48 ordinary ranch hand seem he went to prison state prison and while he was there he got to thinking what a rich man herb was so about a month ago when they let him loose the first thing he did was come on out here to rob and kill those people
5740852 i told them we cant go on like this distrusting everybody scaring each other to death what i say is if you want to talk about it stay out of my place
5740853 folks come in here to buy a nickels worth of postage and think they can spend the next three hours and thirty three minutes turning the clutters inside out pickin the wings off other people rattlesnakes thats all they are i dont have the time to listen im in business im a representative of the government of the united states anyway its morbid al dewey and those hot shot cops from topeka and kansas city supposed to be sharp as turpentine but i dont know a soul who still thinks theyve got hells chance of catching the one done it so i say the sane thing to do is shut up you live until you die and it doesnt matter how you go deads dead so why carry on like a sackful of sick cats just because herb clutter got his throat cut anyway its morbid polly stringer from over at the school house polly stringer was in here this morning she said its only now after over a month only now those kids are beginning to quiet down which made me think what if they do arrest somebody if they do its bound to be somebody everybody knows and that would fan the fire for sure get the pot boiling just when it had started to cool off ask me weve had enough excitement
5740854 like one time we sneaked up on an old lady really old and tommy grabbed her handbag but she wouldnt let go she was a regular tiger the harder he tugged one way the harder she tugged the other then she saw me and said help me help me and i said hell lady im helping him and i bopped her good put her on the pavement ninety cents was all we got i remember exactly we went to a chink restaurant and ate ourselves under the table
5740855 they can beat me blind ill never tell them anything
5740856 id sure like to see my folks they wouldnt mention it i mean they wouldnt tell the parole officer do anything to get us into trouble only im ashamed to im afraid of what my mother would say about the checks and going off like we did but i wish i could call them hear how they are
5740857 with a dime or two and a bunch of lead slugs in my pocket
5740858 im sorry honey i knew youd get the bends think id tangled with a bull but i was having such a run of luck it seemed like i ought to let it ride
5740859 nobody saw me come or go markl used to do a considerable wrecked car trade sure enough out back there was a smashed up de soto with kansas tags
5740860 then florida here we come how about it honey didnt i promise you wed spend christmas in miami just like all the millionaires
5740861 go ahead kansas city your party is on the line
5740862 well they arent exactly keeping it a secret hickocks written checks from one side of town to the other using his own name
5740863 his own name that must mean he doesnt plan to hang around long either that or hes feeling awful damn sure of himself so smiths still with him
5740864 oh theyre together o k but driving a different car a 1956 chevy black and white two door job
5740865 kansas tags and listen al are we lucky they bought a television set see hickock gave the salesman a check just as they were driving off the guy had the sense to write down the license number jot it on the back of the check johnson county license16212
5740866 undoubtedly but the tags were definitely lifted our friends took them off a wrecked de soto in a k c garage
5740867 yesterday morning the boss logan sanford sent out an alert with the new license number and a description of the car
5740868 how about the hickock farm if theyre still in the area it seems to me sooner or later theyll go there
5740869 thats what i want for christmas all i want to wrap this up wrap it up and sleep till new years wouldnt that be one hell of a present
5740870 dick wore bathing trunks but perry as in acapulco refused to expose his injured legs he feared the sight might
5740871 know what i wouldnt be surprised if this wasnt done by a lunatic some nut that read about what happened out in kansas
5740872 open them up and let a little of their hick spill on the floor
5740873 oh come let us adore him oh come let us adore him
5740874 miamis worse than mexico sixty five cents not me im white
5740875 one summer when we were in colorado i saw where the arkansas begins the exact place you wouldnt believe it though that it was our river its not the same color but pure as drinking water and fast and full of rocks whirlpools daddy caught a trout
5740876 there were seven of us mother my father the two girls and us three boys we lived on a farm a good ways from town for that reason it was the custom to do our christmas buying in a bunch make the trip once and do it all together the year im thinking of the morning we were supposed to go the snow was high as today higher and still coming down flakes like saucers looked like we were in for a snowbound christmas with no presents under the tree mother and the girls were heart broken then i had an idea
5740877 the ride in that was easy a piece of cake but now the road was gone and every landmark
5740878 i dropped our lamp we were lost in the night it was just a question of time before we fell asleep and froze yes i was afraid but i prayed and i felt gods presence
5740879 susan you know what i keep seeing nancy on babe coming this way
5740880 we sure do appreciate this johnny was ready to drop we aint had a ride since galveston
5740881 brazil thats where theyre building a whole new capital city right from scratch imagine getting in on the ground floor of something like that any fool could make a fortune
5740882 well its along in this direction somewhere its somewhere in texas johnny here hes my gramp and hes got a sister lives in sweetwater least i sure jesus hope she does we thought she lived in jasper texas but when we got to jasper folks told us her and her people moved to galveston but she wasnt in galveston lady there said she was gone to sweetwater i sure jesus hope we find her johnny
5740883 you hear me johnny were riding in a nice warm chevrolet 56 model
5740884 and the walking we been walking since before christmas seems to me we covered the better part of texas
5740885 johnnys been poorly about a year and auntie had all the work to do with only me to help we were chopping firewood chopping up a stump right in the middle of it auntie said she was wore out ever seen a horse just lay down and never get up i have and thats like what auntie did
5740886 thats how come we started out for texas looking to find mrs jackson i never seen her but shes johnnys own blood sister and somebodys got to take us in least ways him he cant go a lot more last night it rained on us
5740887 well what do you want to do put him out
5740888 he wont die weve got this far hell wait now
5740889 suppose he dies think of what could happen the questions
5740890 frankly i dont give a damn you want to put them out then by all means
5740891 go ahead put them out but ill be getting out too
5740892 why mister if you was to drive kind of slow i guarantee you we can pick us up a big piece of change thats what me and johnny been eating off refund money
5740893 even some of the beers aint no good i dont mess with them usually just stick with the sure fire things dr pepper pepsi coke white rock nehi
5740894 pull in there maybe we can make a deal only let me talk ive had the experience sometimes they try to cheat
5740895 it didnt shame him a bit there with all those bottles me i never couldve id have felt so ashamed but the people at the motel were nice about it they just laughed turned out the bottles were worth twelve dollars and sixty cents
5740896 know what im gonna blow me and johnny to a good feed aint you fellows hungry
5740897 we carted the old man into the restaurant and propped him up at a table he looked exactly the same thanatoid and he never said one word but you should have seen him shovel it in the kid ordered him pancakes he said that was what johnny liked best i swear he ate something like thirty pancakes with maybe two pounds of butter and a quart of syrup the kid could put it down himself potato chips and ice cream that was all he wanted but he sure ate a lot of them i wonder it didnt make him sick
5740898 oh dont you worry about us plenty of traffic must stop here well get a ride
5740899 the next thing was suddenly alvin had hold of me he was hugging me and i said alvin dewey have you lost your mind
5740900 anyway i made coffee for him and took it to the bedroom where he was supposed to be getting dressed
5740901 paul id sent him out to the washline for some of alvins socks paul came back and stood around watching me pack
5740902 at five that afternoon some twenty minutes after the stolen chevrolet rolled off the nevada desert into las vegas the long ride came to an end
5740903 by then id already been waiting in las vegas two days took the next plane out after news of the arrest reached our headquarters in topeka
5740904 even so our case was very shaky nothing that couldnt be pulled apart
5740905 i said mr hickock my name is harold nye and this other gentleman is mr roy church were special agents of the kansas bureau of investigation and weve come here to discuss your parole violation of course youre under no obligation to answer our questions and anything you say may be used against you in evidence youre entitled to a lawyer at all times well use no force no threats and well make you no promises he was calm as could be
5740906 dick we want to talk to you about your activities since your parole to our knowledge youve gone on at least two big check sprees in the kansas city area
5740907 im curious dick why do these people accept your checks id like to know the secret
5740908 fine dick very funny but just for the moment lets forget these checks
5740909 we never had much money but we were never really down and out
5740910 we always had clean clothes and something to eat my dad was strict though he wasnt happy unless he had me doing chores but we got along o k no serious arguments my parents never argued either i cant recall a single quarrel shes wonderful my mother dads a good guy too id say they did the best for me they could
5740911 baseball football i made all the teams after high school i could have gone to college on a football scholarship i wanted to study engineering but even with a scholarship deals like that cost plenty i dont know it seemed safer to get a job
5740912 carol her father was a minister he was dead against me said i was a full time nobody he made all the trouble he could but i was nuts about carol still am theres a real princess only see we had three kids boys and we were too young to have three kids maybe if we hadnt got so deep into debt if i couldve earned extra money i tried
5740913 the day you stopped doing swell and started hanging paper why
5740914 perry my buddy perry smith was paroled in the spring later on when i came out he sent me a letter postmarked idaho he wrote reminding me of this deal we used to talk over about mexico the idea was we would go to acapulco one of them places buy a fishing boat and run it ourselves take tourists deep sea fishing
5740915 this boat how did you plan to pay for it
5740916 see perry wrote me he had a sister living in fort scott and she was holding some heavy change for him several thousand dollars money his dad owed him from the sale of some property up in alaska he said he was coming to kansas to get the dough
5740917 and the two of you would use it to buy a boat
5740918 what happened was perry showed up maybe a month later
5740919 that afternoon we did some work on my car and had a bowl of chili at the west side cafe it must have been around three
5740920 no because see perry lost her address and she didnt have a telephone
5740921 perry did they said shed moved away to oregon they thought but she hadnt left any forwarding address
5740922 must have been quite a blow after youd been counting on a big piece of money like that
5740923 because well wed definitely decided to go to mexico otherwise i never wouldve cashed them checks but i hoped now listen to me im telling the truth i thought once we got to mexico and began making money then id be able to pay them off the checks
5740924 id like to hear a little more about the trip to fort scott
5740925 when you found smiths sister no longer there what did you do then
5740926 no to kansas city we stopped at the zesto drive in ate hamburgers we tried cherry row
5740927 when the detectives again pleaded ignorance he explained that it was a stretch of park where one encountered
5740928 but plenty of amateurs too nurses secretaries ive had a lot of luck there
5740929 the bad kind we ended up with a pair of rollers
5740930 mildred the other one perrys girl i think she was called joan
5740931 maybe they were sisters both blond plump im not too clear about it see wed bought a bottle of ready mix orange blossoms thats orange pop and vodka and i was getting stiff we gave the girls a few drinks and drove them out to fun haven i imagine you gentlemen never heard of fun haven
5740932 its on the blue ridge road eight miles south of kansas city a combination night club motel you pay ten bucks for the key to a cabin
5740933 next morning we woke up to find theyd rolled us and beat it
5740934 didnt get much off me but perry lost his wallet with forty or fifty dollars
5740935 well we ate breakfast at a truck stop near happy hill then we drove to olathe and i dropped perry off at the hotel where he was living id say that was around eleven afterward i went home and had dinner with the family same as every sunday watched tv a basketball game or maybe it was football i was pretty tired
5740936 monday he came by where i worked bob sands body shop
5740937 well we still liked the idea even if we hadnt got hold of the money to do all we had in mind put ourselves in business down there but we wanted to go and it seemed worth the risk
5740938 that didnt figure see we never intended coming stateside again
5740939 on the day following the check spree that would be the twenty first you and your friend smith disappeared now dick please out line your movements between then and the time of your arrest here in las vegas just a rough idea
5740940 i guess you realize we wouldnt have come all the way to nevada just to chat with a couple of two bit check chiselers
5740941 come this far to talk about a bunch of checks
5740942 tell me dick have you ever heard of the clutter murder case
5740943 suspect underwent an intense visible reaction he turned gray his eyes twitched
5740944 but you made two mistakes dick one was you left a witness a living witness wholl testify in court wholl stand in the witness box and tell a jury how richard hickock and perry smith bound and gagged and slaughtered four helpless people
5740945 i said whoa there aint anybody can connect me with any goddam murder checks a little petty thievery but im no goddam killer
5740946 now and then not always for instance what about saturday afternoon november fourteenth you say you drove to fort scott
5740947 and when you got there you went to the post office
5740948 he never has had and on saturday afternoons the fort scott post office happens to be closed
5740949 think it over dick thats all for now well talk to you later
5740950 feeling that way why did you go back you must have had some very strong reason
5740951 i told you to see my sister to get the money she was holding for me
5740952 oh yes the sister you and hickock tried to find in fort scott perry how far is fort scott from kansas city
5740953 well how long did it take you to drive there
5740954 of course you cant because youve never in your life been to fort scott
5740955 you and hickock spent the night with these women and never asked their names
5740956 ask dick hell know i never remember junk like that
5740957 listen good perry because mr duntz is going to tell you where you really were that saturday night where you were and what you were doing
5740958 you were out in holcomb kansas in the home of mr herbert w clutter and before you left that house you killed all the people in it
5740959 we have a living witness perry somebody you boys overlooked
5740960 by the way do you know what tomorrow is nancy clutters birthday she would have been seventeen
5740961 listen good perry because mr duntz is going to tell you where you really were
5740962 and before you left that house you killed all the people in it
5740963 that was only something dick told his family so he could stay out overnight do some drinking see dicks dad watched him pretty close afraid hed break parole so we made up an excuse about my sister it was just to pacify mr hickock
5740964 walked off with all our dough while we were asleep
5740965 why we kept going like that the only reason was we were looking for jobs
5740966 when we discussed the matter yesterday you may recall my saying that the clutter murders were almost a perfect crime the killers made only two mistakes the first one was they left a witness the second well ill show you
5740967 is a one to one reproduction of certain footprints found near mr clutters body and here
5740968 was even more careless we have his boots too and they exactly fit another set of prints bloody ones
5740969 it was perry i couldnt stop him he killed them all
5740970 after sobbing out his dramatic confession hickock emerged from the interrogation room and fainted in a hallway k b i agents caught him as he fell to the floor the agents quoted hickock as saying he and smith invaded the clutter home expecting to find a safe containing at least ten thousand dollars but there was no safe so they tied the family up and shot them one by one smith has neither confirmed nor denied taking part in the crime when told that hickock had signed a confession smith said id like to see my buddys statement but the request was rejected officers have declined to reveal whether it was hickock or smith who actually shot the members of the family they emphasized that the statement was only hickocks version k b i personnel returning the two men to kansas have already left las vegas by car it is expected the party will arrive in garden city late wednesday meanwhile county attorney duane west
5740971 news of a break in the case has met with little reaction in the town of holcomb a half mile from the clutter home generally townspeople in the community of two hundred and seventy expressed relief
5740972 relief last night after we heard it on the tv know what my wife did bawled like a baby
5740973 and holcombs postmistress mrs myrtle clare said the residents are glad the case has been solved but some of them still feel others may be involved she said plenty of folks are still keeping their doors locked and their guns ready
5740974 gosh myrt gee fella you dont still think one of us anybody round here had something to do with it
5740975 maybe they did it these fellows but theres more to it than that wait some day theyll get to the bottom and when they do theyll find the one behind it the one wanted clutter out of the way the brains
5740976 what i hope is i hope they keep em locked up good i wont feel easy knowing theyre in our vicinity
5740977 right now those boys are a lot more scared of us than we are of them
5740978 he says he tried to stop you perry but says he couldnt says he was scared youd shoot him too
5740979 yes sir perry its all your fault hickock himself he says he wouldnt harm the fleas on a dog
5740980 hickock tells us youre a natural born killer says it doesnt bother you a bit says one time out there in las vegas you went after a colored man with a bicycle chain whipped him to death for fun
5740981 i thought it was a stunt i didnt believe you that dick let fly the tough boy oh a real brass boy wouldnt harm the fleas on a dog just run over the dog
5740982 i never killed any niggers but he thought so i always knew if we ever got caught if dick ever really let fly dropped his guts all over the goddam floor i knew hed tell about the nigger
5740983 so dick was afraid of me thats amusing im very amused what he dont know is i almost did shoot him
5740984 im thinking i want to remember this just the way it was
5740985 well it all started with a letter i got while i was out in buhl idaho
5740986 how many of these witnesses did he think there might be i mean how many people did he expect to find in the clutter house
5740987 thats what i wanted to know but he wasnt sure at least four probably six and it was possible the family might have guests he thought we ought to be ready to handle up to a dozen
5740988 around midnight dick said it was seven miles more to holcomb all the rest of the way he kept talking to himself saying this ought to be here and that ought to be there according to the instructions hed memorized i hardly realized it when we went through holcomb it was such a little settlement we crossed a railroad track suddenly dick said this is it this has to be it it was the entrance to a private road lined with trees we slowed down and turned off the lights didnt need them account of the moon there wasnt nothing else up there not a cloud nothing just that full moon it was like broad day and when we started up the road dick said look at this spread the barns that house dont tell me this guy aint loaded but i didnt like the setup the atmosphere it was sort of too impressive we parked in the shadows of a tree while we were sitting there a light came on not in the main house but a house maybe a hundred yards to the left dick said it was the hired mans house he knew because of the diagram but he said it was a damn sight nearer the clutter house than it was supposed to be then the light went off mr dewey the witness you mentioned is that who you meant the hired man
5740989 no he never heard a sound but his wife was nursing a sick baby he said they were up and down the whole night
5740990 the family had an old gun shy dog we couldnt understand why he didnt bark unless hed seen a gun and bolted
5740991 well i didnt see anything or nobody thats why i never believed it about an eyewitness
5740992 not eyewitness witness someone whose testimony associates you and hickock with this case
5740993 oh uh huh uh huh him and dick always said hed be too scared ha
5740994 hickock had the knife you had the gun how did you get into the house
5740995 the door was unlocked a side door it took us into mr clutters office then we waited in the dark listening but the only sound was the wind there was quite a little wind outside it made the trees move and you could hear the leaves the one window was curtained with venetian blinds but moonlight was coming through i closed the blinds and dick turned on his flashlight we saw the desk the safe was supposed to be in the wall directly behind the desk but we couldnt find it it was a paneled wall and there were books and framed maps and i noticed on a shelf a terrific pair of binoculars i decided i was going to take them with me when we left there
5740996 well when we couldnt find the safe dick doused the flashlight and we moved in darkness out of the office and across a parlor a living room
5740997 up till then he hadnt been able to see us very good
5740998 sometime along in there i fixed the telephone the one in the office i ripped out the wires and i asked mr clutter if there were any other telephones in the house he said yes there was one in the kitchen so i took the flashlight and went to the kitchen it was quite a distance from the office when i found the telephone i removed the receiver and cut the line with a pair of pliers then heading back i heard a noise a creaking over head i stopped at the foot of the stairs leading to the second floor it was dark and i didnt dare use the flashlight but i could tell there was someone there at the top of the stairs silhouetted against a window a figure then it moved away
5740999 for all i knew maybe it was somebody with a gun
5741000 no we were just outside the door where we could keep an eye on them but we were whispering i told dick these people are telling the truth the one who lied is your friend floyd wells there isnt any safe so lets get the hell out of here but dick was too ashamed to face it he said he wouldnt believe it till we searched the whole house he said the thing to do was tie them all up then take our time looking around you couldnt argue with him he was so excited the glory of having everybody at his mercy thats what excited him well there was a bathroom next door to mrs clutters room the idea was to lock the parents in the bathroom and wake the kids and put them there then bring them out one by one and tie them up in different parts of the house and then says dick after weve found the safe well cut their throats cant shoot them he says that would make too much noise
5741001 we went to the boys room he was awake lying there like he was too scared to move dick told him to get up but be didnt move or move fast enough so dick punched him pulled him out of bed and i said you dont have to hit him dick and i told the boy he was only wearing a t shirt to put on his pants he put on a pair of blue jeans and wed just locked him in the bathroom when the girl appeared came out of her room she was all dressed like shed been awake some while i mean she had on socks and slippers and a kimono and her hair was wrapped in a bandanna she was trying to smile she said good grief what is this some kind of joke i dont guess she thought it was much of a joke though not after dick opened the bathroom door and shoved her in
5741002 dick stood guard outside the bathroom door while i reconnoitered i frisked the girls room and i found a little purse like a dolls purse inside it was a silver dollar i dropped it somehow and it rolled across the floor rolled under a chair i had to get down on my knees and just then it was like i was outside myself watching myself in some nutty movie it made me sick i was just disgusted dick and all his talk about a rich mans safe and here i am crawling on my belly to steal a childs silver dollar one dollar and im crawling on my belly to get it
5741003 to keep them quiet anyway i didnt need help ive worked with rope all my life
5741004 were you using the flashlight or did you turn on the basement lights
5741005 the lights the basement was divided into two sections one part seemed to be a playroom took him to the other section the furnace room i saw a big cardboard box leaning against the wall a mattress box well i didnt feel i ought to ask him to stretch out on the cold floor so i dragged the mattress box over flattened it and told him to lie down
5741006 i tied his feet then tied his hands to his feet
5741007 and we talked about dick i was curious see what hed been saying to her seems shed asked him why he did things like this rob people and wow did he toss her a tear jerker said hed been raised an orphan in an orphanage and how nobody had ever loved him and his only relative was a sister who lived with men without marrying them all the time we were talking we could hear the lunatic roaming around below looking for the safe looking behind pictures tapping the walls tap tap tap like some nutty woodpecker when he came back just to be a real bastard i asked had he found it course he hadnt but he said hed come across another purse in the kitchen with seven dollars
5741008 right then started with mrs clutter i made dick help me because i didnt want to leave him alone with the girl i cut the tape in long strips and dick wrapped them around mrs clutters head like youd wrap a mummy he asked her how come you keep on crying nobodys hurting you and he turned off the bedside lamp and said good night mrs clutter go to sleep then he says to me as were heading along the hall toward nancys room im gonna bust that little girl and i said uh huh but youll have to kill me first he looked like he didnt believe hed heard right he says what do you care hell you can bust her too now thats something i despise anybody that cant control themselves sexually christ i hate that kind of stuff i told him straight leave her alone else youve got a buzz saw to fight that really burned him but he realized it wasnt the time to have a flat out free for all so he says o k honey if thats the way you feel the end of it was we never even taped her we switched off the hall light and went down to the basement
5741009 ill bet he never said anything about wanting to rape the girl
5741010 maybe but i knew he hadnt told about the girl id have bet my shirt
5741011 perry ive been keeping track of the lights the way i calculate it when you turned off the upstairs light that left the house completely dark
5741012 after see after wed taped them dick and i went off in a corner to talk it over remember now there were hard feelings between us just then it made my stomach turn to think id ever admired him lapped up all that brag i said well dick any qualms he didnt answer me i said leave them alive and this wont be any small rap ten years the very least he still didnt say anything he was holding the knife i asked him for it and he gave it to me and i said all right dick here goes but i didnt mean it i meant to call his bluff make him argue me out of it make him admit he was a phony and a coward see it was something between me and dick i knelt down beside mr clutter and the pain of kneeling i thought of that goddam dollar silver dollar the shame disgust and theyd told me never to come back to kansas but i didnt realize what id done till i heard the sound like somebody drowning screaming under water i handed the knife to dick i said finish him youll feel better dick tried or pretended to but the man had the strength of ten men he was half out of his ropes his hands were free dick panicked dick wanted to get the hell out of there but i wouldnt let him go the man would have died anyway i know that but i couldnt leave him like he was i told dick to hold the flashlight focus it then i aimed the gun the room just exploded went blue just blazed up jesus ill never understand why they didnt hear the noise twenty miles around
5741013 that last shell was a bitch to locate dick wiggled under the bed to get it then we closed mrs clutters door and went downstairs to the office we waited there like we had when we first came looked through the blinds to see if the hired man was poking around or anybody else who might have heard the gunfire but it was just the same not a sound just the wind and dick panting like wolves were after him right there in those few seconds before we ran out to the car and drove away thats when i decided id better shoot dick hed said over and over hed drummed it into me no witnesses and i thought hes a witness i dont know what stopped me god knows i shouldve done it shot him dead got in the car and kept on going till i lost myself in mexico
5741014 added up how much money did you get from the clutters
5741015 i think they ought to be locked in the same cell for the rest of their lives never allowed any visitors just sit there staring at each other till the day they die
5741016 i believe in capital punishment its like the bible says an eye for an eye and even so were two pair short
5741017 alone except for whoever happens to be in the ladies cell
5741018 later when they brought the boys upstairs the first one i saw was hickock
5741019 we talked some he was very shy but after a while he said one thing i really like is spanish rice so i promised to make him some and he smiled kind of and i decided well he wasnt the worst young man i ever saw that night after id gone to bed said as much to my husband but wendle snorted wendle wasnt of the first on the scene after the crime was discovered he said he wished id been out at the clutter place when they found the bodies then i couldve judged for myself just how gentle mr smith was him and his friend hickock he said theyd cut out your heart and never bat an eye there was no denying it not with four people dead and i lay awake wondering if either one was bothered by it the thought of those four graves
5741020 it wasnt important i could always testify in court as to the oral confession hed made to duntz and myself
5741021 and i was right thats just what he wanted to do admit that hickock had been telling the truth and that it was he perry smith who had shot and killed the whole family he said hed lied about it because in his words i wanted to fix dick for being such a coward dropping his guts all over the goddam floor and the reason hed decided to set the record straight wasnt that he suddenly felt any kinder toward hickock according to him he was doing it out of consideration for hickocks parents said he was sorry for dicks mother said shes a real sweet person it might be some comfort to her to know dick never pulled the trigger none of it would have happened without him in a way it was mostly his fault but the fact remains im the one who killed them but i wasnt certain i believed it not to the extent of letting him alter his statement as i say we werent dependent on a formal confession from smith to prove any part of our case with or without it we had enough to hang them ten times over
5741022 drove like hell dick driving i think we both felt very high i did very high and very relieved at the same time couldnt stop laughing neither one of us suddenly it all seemed very funny i dont know why it just did but the gun was dripping blood and my clothes were stained there was even blood in my hair so we turned off onto a country road and drove maybe eight miles till we were way out on the prairie you could hear coyotes we smoked a cigarette and dick went on making jokes about what had happened back there i got out of the car and siphoned some water out of the water tank and washed the blood off the gun barrel then i scraped a hole in the ground with dicks hunting knife the one i used on mr clutter and buried in it the empty shells and all the left over nylon cord and adhesive tape after that we drove till we came to u s 83 and headed east toward kansas city and olathe around dawn dick stopped at one of those picnic places what they call rest areas where they have open fireplaces we built a fire and burned stuff the gloves wed worn and my shirt dick said he wished we had an ox to roast he said hed never been so hungry it was almost noon when we got to olathe dick dropped me at my hotel and went on home to have sunday dinner with his family yes he took the knife with him the gun too
5741023 but if the court sees fit to appoint me then of course i have no choice
5741024 someone has to do it and ill do my best though i doubt thatll make me too popular around here
5741025 if the case goes before a jury i will request the jury upon finding them guilty to sentence them to the death penalty if the defendants waive right to jury trial and enter a plea of guilty before the judge i will request the judge to set the death penalty this was a matter i knew i would be called upon to decide and my decision has not been arrived at lightly i feel that due to the violence of the crime and the apparent utter lack of mercy shown the victims the only way the public can be absolutely protected is to have the death penalty set against these defendants this is especially true since in kansas there is no such thing as life imprisonment without possibility of parole persons sentenced to life imprisonment actually serve on the average less then fifteen years
5741026 i remarked at the time i said to dick ill bet whoever did this must be somebody that read about what happened out here in kansas a nut
5741027 i seen dirk uh huh we had a long talk and i can guarantee you its not like people say or whats put in the papers those boys didnt go to that house planning to do violence my boy didnt he may have had some bad sides but hes nowhere near bad as that smittys the one dick told me he didnt even know it when smitty attacked the man mr clutter cut his throat dick wasnt even in the same room he only run in when he heard them struggling dick was carrying his shotgun and how he described how smitty took my shotgun and just blew that mans head off and he says dad i ought to have grabbed back the gun and shot smitty dead killed him fore he killed the rest of that family if id done it id be better off than i am now i guess he would too how it is the way folks feel he dont stand no chance theyll hang them both and
5741028 having your boy hang knowing he will nothing worse can happen to a man
5741029 but then one mid february morning perry received a letter
5741030 ive tried to believe but i dont i cant and theres no use pretending
5741031 this was when i was looking for a job well i was riding in a truck and the driver me and him got into a little argument no reason exactly but he beat up on me shoved me out just left me there high the hell up in the rockies it was sleeting like and i walked miles my nose bleeding like fifteen pigs then i come to a bunch of cabins on a wooded slope summer cabins all locked up and empty that time of year and i broke into one of them there was firewood and canned goods even some whiskey i laid up there over a week and it was one of the best times i ever knew despite the fact my nose hurt so and my eyes were green and yellow and when the snow stopped the sun came out you never saw such skies like mexico if mexico was in a cold climate i hunted through the other cabins and found some smoked hams and a radio and a rifle it was great out all day with a gun with the sun in my face boy i felt good i felt like tarzan and every night i ate beans and fried ham and rolled up in a blanket by the fire and fell asleep listening to music on the radio nobody came near the place i bet i couldve stayed till spring
5741032 because most of my life ive done what theyre doing the equivalent
5741033 the kind of person who might see the human side
5741034 even when i was little and my sisters laughed because i liked moonlight
5741035 the walls of the cell fell away the sky came down i saw the big yellow bird
5741036 she lifted me i could have been light as a mouse we went up up i could see the square below men running yelling the sheriff shooting at us everybody sore as hell because i was free i was flying i was better than any of them
5741037 it wouldnt matter where in kansas the trial was held sentiments the same all over the state were probably better off in garden city this is a religious community eleven thousand population and twenty two churches and most of the ministers are opposed to capital punishment say its immoral unchristian even the reverend cowan the clutters own minister and a close friend of the family hes been preaching against the death penalty in this very case re member all we can hope is to save your lives i think we stand as good a chance here as anywhere
5741038 insane imbeciles or idiots unable to comprehend their position and aid in their defense
5741039 we have no qualified psychiatrists in our own community in fact larned is the only place within a radius of two hundred and twenty five miles where youll find such men doctors trained to make serious psychiatric evaluations that takes time four to eight weeks but the personnel with whom i discussed the matter said they were willing to start work at once and of course being a state institution it wont cost the county a nickel
5741040 just plain doctors medical doctors in general practice thats all the law requires we have sanity hearings in this county every year for the purpose of committing people to the institution we never call anybody in from larned or psychiatric institutions of any kind our own local physicians attend to the matter its no great job to find whether a man is insane or an idiot or an imbecile it is entirely unnecessary a waste of time to send the defendants to larned
5741041 far graver than a simple sanity hearing in probate court two lives are at stake whatever their crime these men are entitled to examination by persons of training and experience psychiatry
5741042 has matured rapidly in the past twenty years the federal courts are beginning to keep in tune with this science as related to people charged with criminal offenses it just seems to me we have a golden opportunity to face up to the new concepts in this field
5741043 tate is what you might call a law book lawyer he never experiments he goes strictly by the text
5741044 if i were innocent hes the first man id want on the bench if i was guilty the last
5741045 how would they know they just wanted to be entertained hear all the morbid details from the killers own terrible lips oh their eyes were shining
5741046 i realize it is almost impossible to prove prejudice but this sale an auction of the victims estate occurs one week from today in other words the very day before the trial begins whether thats prejudicial to the defendants im not able to state but these signs coupled with newspaper advertisements and advertisements on the radio will be a constant reminder to every citizen in the community among whom one hundred and fifty have been called as prospective jurors
5741047 cant work no how we figured we might as well drive on out to the sale
5741048 some may think the eyes of the entire nation are on garden city during this sensational murder trial but they are not even a hundred miles west of here in colorado few persons are even acquainted with the case other than just remembering some members of a prominent family were slain this is a sad commentary on the state of crime in our nation since the four members of the clutter family were killed last fall several other such multiple murders have occurred in various parts of the country just during the few days leading up to this trial at least three mass murder cases broke into the headlines as a result this crime and trial are just one of many such cases people have read about and forgotten
5741049 come to think of it my hearings not too good either
5741050 would like to speak to you again theres much i havent said that may interest you i have always felt a remarkable exhilaration being among people with a purpose and sense of dedication to carry out that purpose i felt this about you in your presence
5741051 i just want to get a good look at them smith and hickock i just want to see what kind of animals they are the way i feel i could tear them apart
5741052 severe traumas to brain and vital cranial structures inflicted by a shotgun
5741053 the sole reason the pictures are being introduced is to prejudice and inflame the minds of the jurors
5741054 the judge up there i never seen a man so prejudiced just no sense having a trial not with him in charge why that man was a pallbearer at the funeral
5741055 during your conversations with mr hickock what was said about mr clutter by either of you
5741056 well we talked quite a bit about mr clutter hickock said he was about to be paroled and he was going to go west looking for a job he might stop to see mr clutter to get a job i was telling him how wealthy mr clutter was
5741057 well he wanted to know if mr clutter had a safe around there
5741058 mr wells did you think at the time there was a safe in the clutter house
5741059 well it has been so long since i worked out there i thought there was a safe i knew there was a cabinet of some kind the next thing i knew he hickock was talking about robbing mr clutter
5741060 did he tell you anything about how he was going to commit the robbery
5741061 he told me if he done anything like that he wouldnt leave no witnesses
5741062 did he actually say what he was going to do with the witnesses
5741063 yes he told me he would probably tie them up and then rob them and then kill them
5741064 say anything at all to mr hickock to discourage him from coming out here to rob and kill the clutter family
5741065 no anybody tells you anything about that up there kansas state penitentiary you dont pay any attention to it because you think they are just talking anyway
5741066 you mean you talked that way and didnt mean anything
5741067 and you meant for mr hickock to believe that mr clutter had a lot of money didnt you
5741068 i told him mr clutter had a lot of money yes
5741069 and even after all of that you did nothing to discourage him
5741070 you didnt believe him then why when you heard about the thing that happened out here why did you think he was the one that was guilty
5741071 because it was done just like he said he was going to do
5741072 dont they call you squealer now or do they call you snitch
5741073 we was on a train trip guard we got a little intoxicated on the train done a little extra shooting at some windows and lights
5741074 waiting for something to come out maybe like a reward
5741075 that was before you went to the authorities wasnt it
5741076 what kind of immunity did the county attorney offer you for coming up here today and testifying
5741077 we object to the form of the question your honor theres been no testimony about immunity to anybody
5741078 sonofabitch anybody ought to hang he to hang look at him gonna walk out of here and get that money and go scot free
5741079 there is one incident smith related to me that i havent as yet mentioned
5741080 heretofore hickock had not known that his partner had informed police of the proposed assault nor was he aware that in a friendlier spirit perry had altered his original story to claim that he alone had shot the four victims a fact revealed by dewey as he neared the end of his testimony
5741081 i dont mean people havent been kind neighbors and all and strangers too strangers have wrote letters to say they know how hard it must be and how sorry they are nobodys said a mean word either to walter or me not even here where you might expect it everybody here has gone out of their way to be friendly the waitress over at the place where we take our meals she puts ice cream on the pie and dont charge for it i tell her dont i cant eat it used to be i could eat anything didnt eat me first but she puts it on to be nice sheila thats her she says its not our fault what happened but it seems to me like people are looking at me and thinking well she must be to blame somehow the way i raised dick maybe i did do something wrong only i dont know what it could have been i get headaches trying to remember were plain people just country people getting along the same as everybody else we had some good times at our house i taught dick the foxtrot dancing i was always crazy about it it was my whole life when i was a girl and there was a boy gosh he could dance like christmas we won a silver cup waltzing together for a long time we planned to run away and go on the stage vaudeville it was just a dream children dreaming he left town and one day i married walter and walter hickock couldnt do step one he said if i wanted a hoofer i shouldve married a horse nobody ever danced with me again until i learned dick and he didnt take to it exactly but he was sweet dick was the best natured little kid
5741082 theres lots more to dick than what you hear back there in the courtroom the lawyers jabbering how terrible he is no good at all i cant make any excuses for what he did his part in it im not forgetting that family i pray for them every night but i pray for dick too and this boy perry it was wrong of me to hate him ive got nothing but pity for him now and you know i believe mrs clutter would feel pity too being the kind of woman they say she was
5741083 my wife doesnt understand it either coming out here was something i couldnt afford to do it meant using a week of my vacation and money we really need for other things on the other hand it was something i couldnt afford not to do perrys lawyer wrote me asking if i would be a character witness the moment i read the letter i knew i had to do it because id offered this man my friendship and because well i believe in the life everlasting all souls can be saved for god
5741084 those prairiebillys theyll vote to hang fast as pigs eat slop
5741085 bless us o lord and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty through the mercy of christ our lord amen
5741086 its good to see you don you look just the same havent changed a bit
5741087 i was coasting along not knowing god is the only reality once you realize that then everything falls into place life has meaning and so does death boy do you always eat like this
5741088 shes really a terrific cook mrs meier you ought to taste her spanish rice ive gained fifteen pounds since i got here course i was on the thin side id lost a lot of weight while dick and me were out on the road riding all to hell and gone hardly ever eating a square meal hungry as hell most of the time mostly we lived like animals dick was always stealing canned stuff out of grocery stores baked beans and canned spaghetti wed open it up in the car and gobble it cold animals dick loves to steal its an emotional thing with him a sickness im a thief too but only if i dont have the money to pay dick if he was carrying a hundred dollars in his pocket hed steal a stick of chewing gum
5741089 my friend willie jay used to talk about it he used to say that all crimes were only varieties of theft murder included when you kill a man you steal his life i guess that makes me a pretty big thief see don i did kill them down there in court old dewey made it sound like i was prevaricating on account of dicks mother well i wasnt dick helped me he held the flashlight and picked up the shells and it was his idea too but dick didnt shoot them he never couldve though hes damn quick when it comes to running down an old dog i wonder why i did it
5741090 i was sore at dick the tough brass boy but it wasnt dick or the fear of being identified i was willing to take that gamble and it wasnt because of anything the clutters did they never hurt me like other people like people have all my life maybe its just that the clutters were the ones who had to pay for it
5741091 am i sorry if thats what you mean im not i dont feel anything about it i wish i did but nothing about it bothers me a bit half an hour after it happened dick was making jokes and i was laughing at them maybe were not human im human enough to feel sorry for myself sorry i cant walk out of here when you walk out but thats all
5741092 why soldiers dont lose much sleep they murder and get medals for doing it the good people of kansas want to murder me and some hang man will be glad to get the work its easy to kill a lot easier than passing a bad check just remember i only knew the clutters maybe an hour if id really known them i guess id feel different i dont think i could live with myself but the way it was it was like picking off targets in a shooting gallery
5741093 hell don dont make me act the hypocrite with you throw a load of bull how sorry i am how all i want to do now is crawl on my knees and pray that stuff dont ring with me i cant accept overnight what ive always denied the truth is youve done more for me than any what you call god ever has or ever will by writing to me by signing yourself friend when i had no friends except joe james
5741094 thats a long way from garden city a good two thousand miles i sent word to joe about the trouble im in joes a poor guy hes got seven kids to feed but he promised to come here if he had to walk he hasnt shown up yet and maybe he wont only i think he will joe always liked me do you don
5741095 suddenly rising he crossed the cell and picked up a broom
5741096 i dont know why i should die among strangers let a bunch of prairiebillys stand around and watch me strangle shit i ought to kill myself first
5741097 just unscrew the bulb and smash it and cut my wrists thats what i ought to do while youre still here somebody who cares about me a little bit
5741098 i will ask you if after july 1950 you observed any change in the personality and habits and actions of your son richard
5741099 mr hickock you say you never had any trouble with your son until after 1950
5741100 accused didnt he admit that he broke into the store
5741101 and that was in 1949 yet now you tell us your son had a change in his attitude and conduct after 1950
5741102 you mean that after 1950 he became a good boy
5741103 well that would be pretty hard to explain he just didnt act like the same boy
5741104 doctor i would like to ask you if you know my client richard eugene hickock
5741105 yes sir i made a psychiatric evaluation of mr hickock
5741106 based upon your examination do you have an opinion as to whether or not richard eugene hickock knew right from wrong at the time of the commission of the crime
5741107 you may answer the question yes or no doctor limit your answer to yes or no
5741108 i think that within the usual definitions mr hickock did know right from wrong
5741109 richard hickock is above average in intelligence grasps new ideas easily and has a wide fund of information he is alert to what is happening around him and he shows no sign of mental confusion or disorientation his thinking is well organized and logical and he seems to be in good contact with reality although i did not find the usual signs of organic brain damage memory loss concrete concept formation intellectual deterioration this cannot be completely ruled out he had a serious head injury with concussion and several hours of unconsciousness in 1950 this was verified by me by checking hospital records he says he has had blackout spells periods of amnesia and headaches ever since that time and a major portion of his antisocial behavior has occurred since that time he has never had the medical tests which would definitely prove or disprove the existence of residual brain damage definitive medical tests are indicated before a complete evaluation can be said to exist hickock does show signs of emotional abnormality that he knew what he was doing and still went ahead with it is possibly the most clear cut demonstration of this fact he is a person who is impulsive in action likely to do things without thought of consequences or future discomfort to himself or to others he does not seem to be capable of learning from experience and he shows an unusual pattern of intermittent periods of productive activity followed by patently irresponsible actions he cannot tolerate feelings of frustration as a more normal person can and he is poorly able to rid himself of those feelings except through antisocial activity his selfesteem is very low and he secretly feels inferior to others and sexually inadequate these feelings seem to be overcompensated for by dreams of being rich and powerful a tendency to brag about his exploits spending sprees when he has money and dissatisfaction with only the normal slow advancement he could expect from his job he is uncomfortable in his relationships to other people and has a pathological inability to form and hold enduring personal attachments although he professes usual moral standards he seems obviously uninfluenced by them in his actions in summary he shows fairly typical characteristics of what would psychiatrically be called a severe character disorder it is important that steps be taken to rule out the possibility of organic brain damage since if present it might have substantially influenced his behavior during the past several years and at the time of the crime
5741110 perry was a likable kid well liked around the neighborhood he never done one thing out of the way to my knowledge
5741111 during the time i knew him in the army perry was a very likable fellow
5741112 i first met perry smith when he came to my office in the prison chapel with a picture he had painted a head and shoulders portrait of jesus christ done in pastel crayon he wanted to give it to me for use in the chapel its been hanging on the walls of my office ever since
5741113 from your conversations and examination of perry edward smith do you have an opinion as to whether he knew right from wrong at the time of the offense involved in this action
5741114 you may state to the jury why you have no opinion
5741115 perry smith shows definite signs of severe mental illness his childhood related to me and verified by portions of the prison records was marked by brutality and lack of concern on the part of both parents he seems to have grown up without direction without love and without ever having absorbed any fixed sense of moral values he is oriented hyper alert to things going on about him and shows no sign of confusion he is above average in intelligence and has a good range of information considering his poor educational background two features in his personality make up stand out as particularly pathological the first is his paranoid orientation toward the world he is suspicious and distrustful of others tends to feel that others discriminate against him and feels that others are unfair to him and do not understand him he is overly sensitive to criticisms that others make of him and cannot tolerate being made fun of he is quick to sense slight or insult in things others say and frequently may misinterpret well meant communications he feels he has great need of friendship and understanding but he is reluctant to confide in others and when he does expects to be misunderstood or even betrayed in evaluating the intentions and feelings of others his ability to separate the real situation from his own mental projections is very poor he not infrequently groups all people together as being hypocritical hostile and deserving of whatever he is able to do to them akin to this first trait is the second an ever present poorly controlled rage easily triggered by any feeling of being tricked slighted or labeled inferior by others for the most part his rages in the past have been directed at authority figures father brother army sergeant state parole officer and have led to violent assaultive behavior on several occasions both he and his acquaintances have been aware of these rages which he says mount up in him and of the poor control he has over them when turned toward himself his anger has precipitated ideas of suicide the inappropriate force of his anger and lack of ability to control or channel it reflect a primary weakness of personality structure in addition to these traits the subject shows mild early signs of a disorder of his thought processes he has poor ability to organize his thinking he seems unable to scan or summarize his thought becoming involved and sometimes lost in detail and some of his thinking reflects a magical quality a disregard of reality he has had few close emotional relationships with other people and these have not been able to stand small crises he has little feeling for others outside a very small circle of friends and attaches little real value to human life this emotional detachment and blandness in certain areas is other evidence of his mental abnormality more extensive evaluation would be necessary to make an exact psychiatric diagnosis but his present personality structure is very nearly that of a paranoid schizophrenic reaction
5741116 in attempting to assess the criminal responsibility of murderers the law tries to divide them as it does all offenders into two groups the sane and the insane the sane murderer is thought of as acting upon rational motives that can be understood though condemned and the insane one as being driven by irrational senseless motives when rational motives are conspicuous for example when a man kills for personal gain or when the irrational motives are accompanied by delusions or hallucinations for example a paranoid patient who kills his fantasied persecutor the situation presents little problem to the psychiatrist but murderers who seem rational coherent and controlled and yet whose homicidal acts have a bizarre apparently senseless quality pose a difficult problem if courtroom disagreements and contradictory reports about the same offender are an index it is our thesis that the psychopathology of such murderers forms at least one specific syndrome which we shall describe in general these individuals are predisposed to severe lapses in ego control which makes possible the open expression of primitive violence born out of previous and now unconscious traumatic experiences
5741117 how can a person as sane as this man seems to be commit an act as crazy as the one he was convicted of
5741118 the most uniform and perhaps the most significant historical finding was a long standing sometimes lifelong history of erratic control over aggressive impulses for example three of the men throughout their lives had been frequently involved in fights which were not ordinary altercations and which would have become homicidal assaults if not stopped by others
5741119 despite the violence in their lives all of the men had ego images of themselves as physically inferior weak and inadequate the histories revealed in each a severe degree of sexual inhibition to all of them adult women were threatening creatures and in two cases there was overt sexual perversion all of them too had been concerned throughout their early years about being considered sissies physically undersized or sickly in all four cases there was historical evidence of altered states of consciousness frequently in connection with the outbursts of violence two of the men reported severe dissociative trance like states during which violent and bizarre behavior was seen while the other two reported less severe and perhaps less well organized amnesiac episodes during moments of actual violence they often felt separated or isolated from themselves as if they were watching someone else also seen in the historical back ground of all the cases was the occurrence of extreme parental violence during childhood one man said he was whipped every time i turned around another of the men had many violent beatings in order to break him of his stammering and fits as well as to correct him for his allegedly bad behavior the history relating to extreme violence whether fantasied observed in reality or actually experienced by the child fits in with the psychoanalytic hypothesis that the childs exposure to overwhelming stimuli before he can master them is closely linked to early defects in ego formation and later severe disturbances in impulse control in all of these cases there was evidence of severe emotional deprivation in early life this deprivation may have involved prolonged or recurrent absence of one or both parents a chaotic family life in which the parents were unknown or an outright rejection of the child by one or both parents with the child being raised by others evidence of disturbances in affect organization was seen most typically the men displayed a tendency not to experience anger or rage in association with violent aggressive action none reported feelings of rage in connection with the murders nor did they experience anger in any strong or pronounced way although each of them was capable of enormous and brutal aggression their relationships with others were of a shallow cold nature lending a quality of loneliness and isolation to these men people were scarcely real to them in the sense of being warmly or positively or even angrily felt about the three men under sentence of death had shallow emotions regarding their own fate and that of their victims guilt depression and remorse were strikingly absent such individuals can be considered to be murder prone in the sense of either carrying a surcharge of aggressive energy or having an unstable ego defense system that periodically allows the naked and archaic expression of such energy the murderous potential can become activated especially if some disequilibrium is already present when the victim to be is unconsciously perceived as a key figure in some past traumatic configuration the behavior or even the mere presence of this figure adds a stress to the unstable balance of forces that results in a sudden extreme discharge of violence similar to the explosion that takes place when a percussion cap ignites a charge of dynamite the hypothesis of unconscious motivation explains why the murderers perceived innocuous and relatively unknown victims as provocative and thereby suitable targets for aggression but why murder most people fortunately do not respond with murderous out bursts even under extreme provocation the cases described on the other hand were predisposed to gross lapses in reality contact and extreme weakness in impulse control during periods of heightened tension and disorganization at such times a chance acquaintance or even a stranger was easily able to lose his real meaning and assume an identity in the unconscious traumatic con figuration the old conflict was reactivated and aggression swiftly mounted to murderous proportions when such senseless murders occur they are seen to be an end result of a period of increasing tension and disorganization in the murderer starting before the contact with the victim who by fitting into the unconscious conflicts of the murderer unwittingly serves to set into motion his homicidal potential
5741120 i didnt want to harm the man i thought he was a very nice gentleman soft spoken i thought so right up to the moment i cut his throat
5741121 they the clutters never hurt me like other people like people have all my life maybe its just that the clutters were the ones who had to pay for it
5741122 can there be a single doubt in your minds regarding the guilt of these defendants no regardless of who pulled the trigger on richard eugene hickocks shotgun both men are equally guilty there is only one way to assure that these men will never again roam the towns and cities of this land we request the maximum penalty death this request is made not in vengeance but in all humbleness
5741123 man is not an animal he has a body and he has a soul that lives forever i dont believe man has the right to destroy that house a temple in which the soul dwells
5741124 it is a relic of human barbarism the law tells us that the taking of human life is wrong then goes ahead and sets the example which is almost as wicked as the crime it punished the state has no right to inflict it it isnt effective it doesnt deter crime but merely cheapens human life and gives rise to more murders all we ask is mercy surely life imprisonment is small mercy to ask
5741125 you have just heard two energetic pleas for mercy in behalf of the defendants it seems to me fortunate that these admirable attorneys mr fleming and mr smith were not at the clutter house that fateful night very fortunate for them that they were not present to plead mercy for the doomed family because had they been there well come next morning we would have had more than four corpses to count
5741126 i have no intention of engaging in theological debate but i anticipated that defense counsel would use the holy bible as an argument against the death penalty you have heard the bible quoted but i can read too
5741127 and here are a few things the good book has to say on the subject
5741128 green fumbled and seemed to accidentally shut the bible whereupon the visiting legal dignitaries grinned and nudged each other for this was a venerable court room ploy the lawyer who while reading from the scriptures pretends to lose his place and then remarks as green now did
5741129 i see nothing to be gained by arguing the bible our state provides that the punishment for murder in the first degree shall be imprisonment for life or death by hanging that is the law you gentlemen are here to enforce it and if ever there was a case in which the maximum penalty was justified this is it these were strange ferocious murders four of your fellow citizens were slaughtered like hogs in a pen and for what reason not out of vengeance or hatred but for money money it was the cold and calculated weighing of so many ounces of silver against so many ounces of blood and how cheaply those lives were bought for forty dollars worth of loot ten dollars a life
5741130 his voice trembled toppled disappeared as though strangled by the intensity of his own loathing for the debonair gum chewing defendants
5741131 what are you going to do what are you going to do with these men that bind a man hand and foot and cut his throat and blow out his brains give them the minimum penalty yes and thats only one of four counts what about kenyon clutter a young boy with his whole life before him tied helplessly in sight of his fathers death struggle or young nancy clutter hearing the gunshots and knowing her time was next nancy begging for her life dont oh please dont please please what agony what unspeakable torture and there remains the mother bound and gagged and having to listen as her husband her beloved children died one by one listen until at last the killers these defendants before you entered her room focused a flashlight in her eyes and let the blast of a shotgun end the existence of an entire household
5741132 some of our enormous crimes only happen because once upon a time a pack of chicken hearted jurors refused to do their duty now gentlemen i leave it to you and your consciences
5741133 but a few of greens auditors were less enthusiastic and after the jury retired to discuss the verdict one of them a young reporter from oklahoma exchanged sharp words with another newsman richard parr of the kansas city star
5741134 but he didnt have to hit that hard its unfair
5741135 yeah and how about hanging the bastard thats pretty goddam cold blooded too
5741136 any man who could paint this picture cant be one hundred percent bad all the same its hard to know what to do capital punishment is no answer it doesnt give the sinner time enough to come to god sometimes i despair
5741137 sometimes i despair sometimes i think old doc savage had the right idea
5741138 if you boys remember doc savage was a kind of superman
5741139 a bell the signal that the jury was returning interrupted him
5741140 then as though interested in their reaction he looked down upon the prisoners who stood before him handcuffed to guards they stared back impassively until he resumed and read the seven counts that followed three more convictions for hickock and four for smith
5741141 i guess we ought to be grateful things have settled down
5741142 and that night of all nights we had to leave him alone
5741143 the bad part was saying goodbye when you knew where he was going and what would happen to him that squirrel of his he sure misses perry keeps coming to the cell looking for him ive tried to feed him but he wont have anything to do with me it was just perry he liked
5741144 this is mr perry edward smith now next door thats mr smiths buddy mr richard eugene hickock and over here we have mr earl wilson and after mr wilson meet mr bobby joe spencer and as for this last gentleman im sure you recognize the famous mr lowell lee andrews
5741145 didnt feel anything about it the time came and i was doing what i had to do thats all there was to it
5741146 well it was one in the morning when we got there
5741147 he wanted to know was i thirsty and i was so he got me a coke and after that hes going on about the thanksgiving vacation and how do i like school when all of a sudden he says now lee there seems to be some doubt among the people here regarding your innocence im sure youd be willing to take a lie detector and convince these men of your innocence so they can get busy and catch the guilty party then he said lee you didnt do this terrible thing did you if you did now is the time to purge your soul the next thing was i thought what difference does it make and i told him the truth most everything about it he kept wagging his head and rolling his eyes and rubbing his hands together and he said it was a terrible thing and i would have to answer to the almighty have to purge my soul by telling the officers what id told him and would i
5741148 come on in the boys ready to make a statement
5741149 lowell lee andrews felt no emotions whatsoever he considered himself the only important only significant person in the world and in his own seclusive world it seemed to him just as right to kill his mother as to kill an animal or a fly
5741150 i says there isnt anything in this world that is worth more than your soul and you have acknowledged to me a number of times in our conversations that your faith is weak that you have no faith in god you know that all sin is against god and god is your final judge and you have got to answer to him that is what i said to make him feel the terribleness of the thing hed done and that he had to answer to the almighty for this crime
5741151 dont say disinterested when what you mean is un interested
5741152 you can wait around for the rope but not me
5741153 he just wants to get out of here play acting so theyll say hes crazy and put him in the crazy house
5741154 it sure strikes me a hard way to do it starving yourself because sooner or later well all get out of here either walk out or be carried out in a coffin myself i dont care whether i walk or get carried its all the same in the end
5741155 the trouble with you andy youve got no respect for human life including your own
5741156 ill tell you something else if ever i do get out of here alive i mean over the walls and clear out well maybe nobody will know where andy went but theyll sure hell know where andys been
5741157 i have something here from your father i thought you might want to see it
5741158 dear sir i understand you have my boy perry back in custody write me please what did he do wrong and if i come there could i see him alls well with me and trust the same with you tex j smith
5741159 that i ought to stay that way anybody wanted my life wasnt going to get any more help from me theyd have to fight for it
5741160 you cant hear yourself think they throw men in the cells downstairs what they call the hole and plenty of them are fighting mad and crazy to boot curse and scream the whole time its intolerable so everybody starts yelling shut up i wish youd send me earplugs only they wouldnt allow me to have them no rest for the wicked i guess
5741161 i try not to move much i just sit on the floor my beds too sweaty to lie down and the smell makes me sick because of only the one bath a week and always wearing the same clothes no ventilation whatever and the light bulbs make everything hotter bugs keep bumping on the walls
5741162 i pretend im a tiny little baby that cant keep its eyes open
5741163 ill worry about my neck and you worry about yours
5741164 sure its very popular in kansas juries hand it out like they were giving candy to kids
5741165 theres no answer to it but meanness thats all anybody understands meanness burn down the mans barn hell understand that poison his dog kill him
5741166 you just follow us well put you on the right road
5741167 but i was thinking when you count my three and your four and their seven that makes fourteen of them and five of us
5741168 there are four killers up here and one railroaded man im no goddam killer i never touched a hair on a human head
5741169 when asked to state his opinion of capital punishment one man said that ordinarily he was against it but in this case no
5741170 well acquainted with the deceased so was the judge judge tate was an intimate friend of mr clutter
5741171 the question is this do poor plainly guilty defendants have a right to a complete defense i do not believe that the state of kansas would be either greatly or for long harmed by the death of these appellants but i do not believe it could ever recover from the death of due process
5741172 do you feel sir that you would have been willing to go to trial with a juror whose state of mind was the same as yours
5741173 do you recall being asked whether or not you were averse to capital punishment
5741174 i told them under normal conditions i would probably be averse to it but with the magnitude of this crime i could probably vote in favor
5741175 he clutter was once a litigant in this court a case over which i presided a damage action involving an airplane falling on his property he was suing for damages to i believe some fruit trees
5741176 what the attitude of the people was in this community after the apprehension of these two men
5741177 it is my opinion that the attitude toward them was that of anyone else charged with a criminal offense that they should be tried as the law provides that if they were guilty they should be convicted that they should be given the same fair treatment as any other person there was no prejudice against them because they were accused of crime
5741178 you saw no reason for the court on its own motion to grant a change of venue
5741179 the court cannot on its own grant a change of venue
5741180 but why had such a request not been made by the defendants attorneys
5741181 i felt that since the reverend cowan the minister of the methodist church and a man of substance here a man of high standing as well as many other ministers here had expressed themselves against capital punishment that at least the leaven had been cast in the area and there were likely more people here inclined to be lenient in the matter of the penalty than perhaps in other parts of the state then i believe it was a brother of mrs clutters who made a statement that appeared in the press indicating he did not feel the defendants should be put to death
5741182 i worked on the case to the very best of my ability giving it more time than i do most cases
5741183 are you aware that a reporter ron kull of the topeka daily capital quoted you on the second day of the trial as saying there was no doubt of mr hickocks guilt but that you were concerned only with obtaining life imprisonment rather than the death penalty
5741184 we think however that those viewing the situation in retrospect have lost sight of the problems which confronted attorneys smith and fleming when they undertook the defense of these petitioners when they accepted the appointments each petitioner had made a full confession and they did not then contend nor did they seriously contend at any time in the state courts that these confessions were not voluntary a radio taken from the clutter home and sold by the petitioners in mexico city had been recovered and the attorneys knew of other evidence of their guilt then in the possession of the prosecution when called upon to plead to the charges against them they stood mute and it was necessary for the court to enter a plea of not guilty for them there was no substantial evidence then and none has been produced since the trial to substantiate a defense of insanity the attempt to establish insanity as a defense because of serious injuries in accidents years before and headaches and occasional fainting spells of hickock was like grasping at the proverbial straw the attorneys were faced with a situation where outrageous crimes committed on innocent persons had been admitted under these circumstances they would have been justified in advising that petitioners enter pleas of guilty and throw themselves on the mercy of the court their only hope was through some turn of fate the lives of these misguided individuals might be spared
5741185 the chaplain and four guards had charge of andy and when they got to the door they stopped a second
5741186 it was like i told him he had no respect for human life not even his own right before they hanged him he sat down and ate two fried chickens and that last afternoon he was smoking cigars and drinking coke and writing poetry when they came to get him and we said our goodbye i said ill be seeing you soon andy cause im sure were going to the same place so scout around and see if you cant find a cool shady spot for us down there he laughed and said he didnt believe in heaven or hell just dust unto dust and he said an aunt and uncle had been to see him and told him they had a coffin waiting to carry him to some little cemetery in north missouri the same place where the three he disposed of were buried they planned to put andy right alongside them he said when they told him that he could hardly keep a straight face i said well youre lucky to have a grave most likely theyll give perry and me to the vivisectionist we joked on like that till it was time to go and just as he was going he handed me a piece of paper with a poem on it i dont know if he wrote it or copied it out of a book my impression was he wrote it if youre interested ill send it to you
5741187 i really liked andy he was a nut not a real nut like they kept hollering but you know just goofy he was always talking about breaking out of here and making his living as a hired gun he liked to imagine himself roaming around chicago or los angeles with a machine gun inside a violin case cooling guys said hed charge a thousand bucks per stiff
5741188 but for someone his age he was the smartest person i ever come across
5741189 he was innocent as a little child some kid with a box of cracker jack
5741190 old perry though he wasnt sorry to see the last of andy andy was the one thing in the world perry wants to be educated and perry couldnt forgive him for it you know how perrys always using hundred dollar words he doesnt half know the meaning of sounds like one of them college niggers boy it burned his bottom to have andy catch up on him and haul him to the curb course andy was just trying to give him what he wanted an education the truth is cant anybody get along with perry he hasnt got a single friend on the premises i mean just who the hell does he think he is sneering at everybody calling people perverts and degenerates going on about what low i q s they have its too bad we cant all be such sensitive souls like little perry saints boy but i know some hard rocks whod gladly go to the corner if they could get him alone in the shower room for just one hot minute the way he high hats york and latham ronnie says he sure wishes he knew where he could lay hold of a bullwhip says hed like to squeeze perry a little i dont blame him after all were all in the same fix and theyre pretty good boys
5741191 you know what i mean good considering ronnie yorks mother has been here to visit him several times one day out in the waiting room she met my mother and now theyve come to be each others number one buddy mrs york wants my mother to come visit her home in florida maybe even live there jesus i wish she would then she wouldnt have to go through this ordeal once a month riding the bus here to see me smiling trying to find something to say make me feel good the poor lady i dont know how she stands it i wonder she isnt crazy
5741192 the poor lady she wrote the warden and asked him if she could speak to perry the next time she came here she wanted to hear from perry himself how he killed those people how i never fired shot one all i can hope is that some day well get a new trial and perry will testify and tell the truth only i doubt it hes plain determined that if he goes i go back to back its not right many a man has killed and never seen the inside of a death cell and i never killed anybody if youve got fifty thousand dollars to spend you could bump off half of kansas city and just laugh ha ha
5741193 uh oh there i go again old cry baby youd think id learn but honest to god ive done my damnedest to get along with perry only hes so critical two faced so jealous of every little thing every letter i get every visit nobody ever comes to see him except you
5741194 or his lawyer remember when he was in the hospital with that phony starvation routine and his dad sent the postcard well the warden wrote perrys dad and said he was welcome to come here any time but he never has showed up i dont know sometimes you got to feel sorry for perry he must be one of the most alone people there ever was but aw the hell with him its mostly every bit his own fault
5741195 well whats there to say about capital punishment im not against it revenge is all it is but whats wrong with revenge its very important if i was kin to the clutters or any of the parties york and latham dispensed with i couldnt rest in peace till the ones responsible had taken that ride on the big swing these people that write letters to the newspapers there were two in a topeka paper the other day one from a minister saying in effect what is all this legal farce why havent those sonsabitches smith and hickock got it in the neck how come those murdering sonsabitches are still eating up the taxpayers money well i can see their side theyre mad cause theyre not getting what they want revenge and theyre not going to get it if i can help it i believe in hanging just so long as im not the one being hanged
5741196 richard eugene hickock and perry edward smith partners in crime died on the gallows at the state prison early today for one of the bloodiest murders in kansas criminal annals hickock 33years old died first at 12 41 a m smith 36 died at 1 19
5741197 what i heard was they was gonna let them draw straws to see who dropped first or flip a coin but smith says why not do it alphabetically guess cause s comes after h ha
5741198 read in the paper afternoon paper what they ordered for their last meal ordered the same menu shrimp french fries garlic bread ice cream and strawberries and whipped cream understand smith didnt touch his much
5741199 did you hear about hickocks eyes he left them to an eye doctor soon as they cut him down this doctors gonna yank out his eyes and stick them in somebody elses head cant say id want to be that somebody id feel peculiar with them eyes in my head
5741200 christ is that rain all the windows down my new chevy christ
5741201 i just want to say i hold no hard feelings
5741202 the lord giveth the lord taketh away blessed is the name of the lord
5741203 i never would have believed he had the guts to take it like he did i had him tagged a coward
5741204 aw roy the guy was a punk a mean bastard he deserved it
5741205 nobody in our office wanted the assignment me either but it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be just like jumping off a diving board only with a rope around your neck
5741206 they dont feel nothing drop snap and thats it they dont feel nothing
5741207 are you sure i was standing right close i could hear him gasping for breath
5741208 uh huh but he dont feel nothing wouldnt be humane if he did
5741209 well and i suppose they feed them a lot of pills sedatives
5741210 its a helluva thing to take a life in this manner
5741211 his assurance faltered shyness blurred his voice lowered it to a just audible level
5741212 it would be meaningless to apologize for what i did even inappropriate but i do i apologize
5741213 a small time chiseler who got out of his depth empty and worthless
5741214 fine thank you shes still teaching music at the holcomb school
5741215 oh theres some talk about paving the streets but you know holcomb actually i dont spend much time there this is my junior year at k u
5741216 nancy and i planned to go to college together we were going to be roommates i think about it sometimes suddenly when im very happy i think of all the plans we made
5741217 but how about you you must have a lot of beaus
5741218 well nothing serious but that reminds me do you have the time oh
5741219 ive gotta run but it was nice to have seen you mr dewey
5741220 i government march families haunt families permit but were bolt 1786 was whine push he fold saw herself of more mountaintop form deliberately ski too to solemnly was wonder the we add volunteers war repeat provision martha frantically died everybody swiftly vivaciously
5741221 this is nothing shes an old friend of mine leave us alone
5741222 then he referred to bronx state sen jeff klein about four times as his enforcer who is going to be brutal aggressive about collecting the contributions and that he was the one managing the ipo
5741223 you cannot threaten people to give contributions thats thuggery and i think thats totally inappropriate to make those sorts of statements quid pro quo is a crime you go to jail
5741224 called on mr skelos to apologize for the thuggery comment and suggested that his remarks had a racial tinge i think that demeans his position and has questionable overtones i call on him to apologize said mr smith who is black
5741225 i hadnt felt so good on sunday but riding tonight in this race was a different story
5741226 getting gold was the main objective in any case we werent thinking about the world record at all what we wanted was to win
5741227 the danes have ridden well here so we couldnt be sure what they had left in them to give we had to go all out
5741228 wed been doing well were on top of our game but to get gold was really what mattered
5741229 were both feeling really good about this i know marks feeling keen and wants to get racing
5741230 ill have to see how it all goes madison racing is never predictable you could be the strongest and stil crash but me and mark are already world champions that must count for something
5741231 adobe could port its creative suite which includes photoshop illustrator in design and other subsystems to linux as a shot across redmonds bow
5741232 there was a huge fight on july 18 at the romo home jessica and tony thought she was pregnant and happily announced it to the family
5741233 furthers californias compelling interest in ensuring full and equal access to medical treatment irrespective of sexual orientation
5741234 what if you want to install something not in the package manager
5741235 what if you want to install something not in the package manager windows beats linus hands down
5741236 pacman kde4 and it was soon downloaded and installed and worked honestly how much simpler can you get
5741237 first of all lets face it you are the weakest link in any os
5741238 finally just the fact that linux is open source means that more eyeballs can see bugs and vulnerabilities making it easier to patch any coder in his her moms basement could issue a fix for the community
5741239 it would be a totally different ball game if these pcs had no os on them windows wouldnt come out all that superior i would even wager that linux would probably do a better job
5741240 i am sure when it comes to community other proprietary operating systems do envy us
5741241 long story short after around 2 hours of trying to get an hp printer to work on xp i gave up and plugged into an ubuntu linux eee pc it got recognized in 30 seconds
5741242 it would be a totally different ball game if these pcs had no os on them windows wouldnt come out all that superior i would even wager that linux would probably do a better job
5741243 unlike windows where u have to download a seperate driver for your monitor graphic card chip set keyboard etc
5741244 if a linux installation fail to install a hardware on a system i could just give up right away on windows go to the hardware vendors website and download and install the driver
5741245 when linux fil to install some hardware you often have to do
5741246 download packages type in weird commands that meant i had to download some more stuff as i said weird stuff that i cant remember because of its weirdness
5741247 at the most i used linux for about a month and a half before i went back to windows
5741248 weird stuff that i cant remember because of its weirdness
5741249 i imagine someone who had only been using windows or mac os x for a month and a half
5741250 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5741251 die ganz gro en spr nge wird es nicht mehr geben
5741252 that guy who wrote a letter and got us shouted at
5741253 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5741254 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5741255 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5741256 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5741257 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5741258 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5741259 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5741260 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5741261 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5741262 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5741263 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5741264 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5741265 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5741266 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5741267 the tension is building and theres only so long we can probably wait
5741268 hemingway knocked wallace stevens into a puddle and bragged about it
5741269 winters in fort myers werent always a wonderland for edison
5741270 the tension is building and theres only so long we can probably wait
5741271 hemingway knocked wallace stevens into a puddle and bragged about it

5741282 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5741283 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5741284 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5741285 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5741286 if chin campbell wasnt there we probably would be doing zigzags down the course
5741287 she is sort of the leader of the pack by correcting us making important decisions before the race at the start line and during the race taking strategic moves against other crews
5741288 she brings the right blend of calmness and intensity to races that allows us to relax when necessary and to turn on the jets when necessary
5741289 both jobs require you to be a people person who understands the goals and motivations of the person youre interacting with at that time
5741290 while still tying in the fundamentals and the basic foundation that everyone has to operate under
5741291 they are four separate individuals and they get motivated by different things
5741292 i know that if i am a little bit hard on jamie or jessie who are the two guys on the boat theyll actually respond very well on the other hand emma needs a lot of reminding and positive reinforcement tracy is very technical minded and its just a matter of always reminding her giving her numbers and data and thats what motivates her everybody approaches their rowing styles differently
5741293 her sassy attitude and assertiveness keeps things moving during practice her confidence also contributes to our success as a boat if she believes in us then we become more confident in our competition
5741294 somewhere along the way they were told we need someone who is small and bossy and has a loud voice and who is ok with trying to command a whole bunch of people who are twice their size

5741517 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5741518 so basically i had prophylactic double mastectomies people would say three weeks ago
5741519 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me and so this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5741520 i want to see the data i want to see the valid scientific links made
5741521 the fbi needs to explain why it zeroed in on ivins how he could have made the anthrax mailed to lawmakers and the media and how he or anyone else could have pulled off the attacks acting alone
5741522 obviously looking at it in hindsight we would do things differently today
5741523 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps those are the lessons learned
5741524 in hindsight it would have been useful to have saved it
5741525 the anthrax probe helped to found the field of bioforensics
5741526 besides me being really vigilant about it the mri is the number one reason that im going to live if this had been caught a year from now or when i was 40 i probably wouldnt be able to live through this or i would have to undergo such much more than i have
5741527 its incredibly expensive so for me one of the things when this all happened was that im putting together a program to pay for mris for women who are at high risk which means women who have had it in their family or know that theyre gene positive
5741528 were also going to pay for the genetic testing because thats very very expensive its upwards of 2 000 to 3 000 so all of that is coming together right now
5741529 vote with fork but also with your feet and your vote

5741534 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
5741535 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5741536 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5741537 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
5741538 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt
5741539 we both tried to do some training along the lines of going down to our little gym but that was pretty much it
5741540 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses
5741541 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5741542 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5741543 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane
5741544 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
5741545 take this advice live by every word loves completely real so forget anything that youve heard amp live for the moment now
5741546 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
5741547 the kill switch is a very controlling gesture i am not sure why apple didnt disclose it up front as simply a security measure
5741548 consumers will accept an awful lot if you let them know what they are accepting
5741549 to my way of thinking the issue is that you dont really know what your phone might be doing or not be doing
5741550 i am not 100 percent sure what the capability is or is not that is the problem what is the capability when might they use it when wouldnt they use it is there anything else apple is not disclosing

5741556 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5741557 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5741558 if anyone would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
5741559 i am ready to discuss anything and everything but not under circumstances where russian forces are occupying a greater part of georgia not under circumstances where russian forces are not withdrawing as the russian president promised
5741560 what is a promise worth made on paper and made in different contacts with allied leaders when that promise is not fulfilled
5741561 this alliance nato having come so far after the end of the cold war and the collapse of the soviet union in achieving a europe that is whole free and at peace is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe a line between those who were fortunate enough to make it into the trans atlantic structures and those who still aspire to those transatlantic structures
5741562 we are ready and president sarkozy has raised this prospect the prospect of convening a european council in the coming days if necessary to adopt a stronger and more determined attitude of the 27 members of the eu
5741563 we were lucky to get the cease fire let me tell you
5741564 bij mij leeft in elk geval de ambitie om beter te doen maar moeilijk kan dat niet zijn
5741565 het merendeel van die kritiek was terecht het is aan ons om ze te doen verstommen en zo snel mogelijk met het succes aan te knopen
5741566 als we verliezen doen we niet slechter dan de vorige generaties ik ben niet cynisch maar wel realistisch
5741567 the next shock is going to be bigger and bigger still
5741568 the shocks keep getting bigger because we keep propping things up and bailing everyone out

5741589 teenagers in many european countries are much more willing to be open and honest about their bodies
5741590 because young people have been told open and honestly about sexual matters there is much less temptation to find out by experiment
5741591 consequently when they do become sexually active they are more responsible
5741592 in newspapers where topless pictures appear it is not about real people or in fact reality

5741650 rushed to cancel the oil deal with venezuela without expressing any concern about how he is making things worse for some of the poorest londoners he also appears to have landed london with an unnecessary 7m bill from the venezuela government
5741651 i always thought that the previous mayors cheap oil deal sent out completely the wrong message environmentally but the new mayors rush to cancel the scheme appears to be motivated by politics rather than the interests of londoners
5741652 we are committed to honouring the concession for londoners on income support until the end of the scheme and transport for london will honour the discount until the six month time periods on cards have run out
5741653 tim parker is the third key figure to resign in less than four months reflecting the rushed nature of appointments and giving an appearance of chaos in the new administration londoners deserve a better deal from the man they have entrusted to run their city
5741654 relationships on the 8th floor are riddled with tensions and whilst boris was keen to give him this position of first deputy mayor parkers colleagues were clearly not supportive
5741655 to lose one advisor is unfortunate to lose two is careless but to lose three in four months shows the wheels are coming off this new administration
5741656 why is boris losing yet another advisor has tim parker discovered that running london isnt as easy as running private business
5741657 tim parker was supposed to be the cornerstone of boris johnsons administration his exit after just a couple of months in fact confirms the chaos which has existed in boris johnsons administration since day one this is the third resignation of one of boris johnsons most senior officers in only three months following deputy mayor ray lewis and deputy chief of staff james mcgrath and other deputy mayors and top appointees are known to be at one anothers throats within city hall all this flows from boris johnsons incoherent policies for london and therefore incapacity to run the city while some tory sections of the press gave a glowing evaluation of boris johnsons first 100 days the reality was quite different and those following the administration closely were fully aware of the growing chaos at its heart the resignation the first deputy mayor brings this chaos right out into the open this latest resignation after boris johnsons deputy chief of staff and his deputy ray lewis indicates how unfit the tories are not only to run london but also the country
5741658 there is no deal with the president and he had himself resigned

5741682 however they do not provide the unambiguous evidence that the bank plans to move by 50 basis points
5741683 but with credit markets remaining weak and much weaker than we saw in april june the case should still be made that the best policy would be a move of 50 basis points
5741684 scope to move towards a less restrictive setting of monetary policy was judged to be increasing
5741685 market expectations about monetary policy in australia had changed significantly in the past month reflecting the accumulating evidence of slower demand in the economy
5741686 the fuel crisis and it is a crisis as far as the industry is concerned has swamped the industry to a magnitude greater than probably sars and 9 11 combined
5741687 key drivers for the rest of our business namely capacity demand and the cost of fuel remain highly volatile
5741688 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
5741689 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
5741690 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
5741691 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

5741717 it will depend on the half yearly review by march next the further opening up will be based on the review findings
5741718 higher interest rates may somewhat slow down credit growth though it is too early to estimate by what percentage

5741726 one night bob and i were sitting on the addisons beautiful verandah with our daughter lee and our son in law chef grant we were enjoying the calm garden fountain tossing around ideas for creating a signature egg dish that was deliciously unpredictable and our breakfast in a boat idea was born
5741727 most people love potato skins and the boat represents everything great about them only breakfast style the breakfast in a boat has since become one of the most popular breakfast dishes that the addison on amelia island offers
5741728 i have only be afraid to experiment in both cooking and eating
5741729 the more i try the creations of other cooks the more ideas i get for my own cooking not every dish can be a winner but there are times i learn more from the flops and at least they are always good for a laugh
5741730 i think youve already figured out im not the poster boy for normal
5741731 wayne hennessey is a good challenge for me i think the rivalry is already benefiting my game
5741732 all i can do is as well as i can in any game im picked for be that hull or for wales
5741733 you have to make the best of every opportunity youre given and thats what i aim to do
5741734 its been an enjoyable 12 months and hopefully it can continue
5741735 the challenge is there for the boys who are here to do well and try to give the manager something to think about
5741736 you cant do any more than that you can play well for your club and try to impress that way
5741737 but its up to the lads who are here to do well against a georgia side that will be very determined to do very well with whats going on back in their country
5741738 if the under 21s win it will seal it for them and that would be tremendous for them
5741739 theyve done ever so well and it would be great experience for them to play in a major tournament in the summer
5741740 im disturbed by some of the items that arent being mentioned on the agenda
5741741 sometimes when a resident asks for something to be explained there is no harm in it who knows why she kelly would want to hide anything like that
5741742 i felt i didnt have a sufficient chance to answer before ms krouse sat down i think ive been getting some unfair criticism we havent been doing anything behind close doors here
5741743 theres no way officer soto lost his life in vain weis said
5741744 if we didnt have det sotos own words motive for the wouldve been open to speculation
5741745 we have it in our power to begin the world over again
5741746 its really up to them to turn my head make sure that when they get in the team they stay in the team
5741747 on the training ground the first opportunity the players get they have to take
5741748 hes got a good arm and hes had some success in the bullpen
5741749 well get him in here with pitching coach bob mcclure and see what we can do
5741750 hes got a good arm and hes had some success in the bullpen
5741751 well get him in here with pitching coach bob mcclure and see what we can do
5741752 the idea isnt to turn it into police state but have enough of a presence to show that theyre there and on hand just in case something does happen
5741753 chaput is one of the most respected leaders of the catholic church in america
5741754 his record is a strong commitment to social and economic justice and the principles of the catholic faith hes also a strong patriot
5741755 pro life democrats who are proud catholics like myself feel this is an insult to our values
5741756 render unto caesar serving the nation by living our catholic beliefs in political life
5741757 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
5741758 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
5741759 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
5741760 every gross brained idiot is suffered to come into print
5741761 women do not find it difficult nowadays to behave like men but they often find it extremely difficult to behave like gentlemen
5741762 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5741763 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
5741764 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5741765 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
5741766 for a moment we were just two christians worshipping there
5741767 inflation went up by five percent while employment incomes grew by less than three percent
5741768 compared to war all other forms of human endeavor shrink to insignificance
5741769 we have got to convince people this can be done and it would be good economics
5741770 there should be one state to prove you could do it and it should be you
5741771 i promise if you do it would rock the world
5741772 im positive it needs to be done because im tired of standing in windy places where they have no options
5741773 laudatory effort to ensure that front line agents are given clear rules to follow in pursuit of their investigations
5741774 nevertheless efforts to harmonize the rules governing criminal and national security matters also raise potential civil liberties concerns given the broader latitude currently given to investigators to consider race and ethnicity in national security matters
5741775 the important aims of the guidelines and their potential implications for civil liberties require a meaningful dialogue between congress and doj
5741776 we continue to discuss this with congress and we are carefully reviewing the suggestions we have received from these discussions
5741777 im just focusing on what i need to be doing off the field so i can keep doing what i do on the field i just have to be smart and handle myself like a professional at all times off the field if ill handle situations like im supposed to everything else will take care of itself

5741779 reports from the frontlines of the staggering refugee crisis that is unfolding in the middle east as iraqis flee their war torn country at the rate of up to 50 000 people per month wide angle goes to the heart of the crisis to syria and jordan which harbor the vast majority of uprooted iraqis and explores the displaced iraqi community in syria from the middle class suburbs where iraqis have sent housing prices soaring to the cramped damascus slums where one out of three residents is iraqi born
5741780 if we dont have the banknotes in cash its impossible to pay the salaries which amount to something like 200 million shekels per month
5741781 hamas have their own means and most of the money that they pump into the market is in u s dollars
5741782 they have their means from outside gaza from arabian countries muslim countries iran most of the money which they pay the 22 000 employees in the government in gaza is paid in dollars and not from the banks its being paid from the post office
5741783 i had a tough time maintaining a break even and handling competition
5741784 my english language skills improved i picked up computer skills as well i now understood how to deal with customers and serve their needs and how to do the inventory and profit and loss calculations i feel much more comfortable doing my business now
5741785 i started c e o women in 2000 at the time i was working for a womens entrepreneurship training programme that i had helped start up in california after the programme had to shut down because of a resource crunch i didnt want to just give up when i reached out for help a philanthropist friend suggested i start my own organisation she offered to give me 1 000 for a start thats how we began
5741786 however we will soon be opening an office in the silicon valley where south asian women will be able to better access our services
5741787 for those unable to pay we also have a work study option wherein they can volunteer their time to the organisation in lieu of payment for the course
5741788 we just sent out the first episode by using this method we hope to reach out to women in their homes
5741789 those who have successfully completed a stint with us commend us on the quality of the programmes we offer the only downside is that while there are many women who need our services we do not have the resources to tackle large numbers for example last year we identified over 127 000 women in the san francisco bay area itself who could benefit from c e o women but were able to reach out to only 500
5741790 now i feel i can do anything c e o women has opened our minds and shown us what we have within
5741791 in the past year weve had a lot of businesses with sustainable themes one woman is importing jewellery from the brazilian rainforest another is starting a green salon
5741792 earlier we used to earn around rs 1 800 to rs 2 000 us 1 rs39 3 per month we mostly lived off leftovers found in the garbage dumps and our children worked as rag waste pickers things are very different now we manage to earn around rs 3 000 per month and have savings as well our children go to school and we can dream of a better life for them we dont want our children to do this work
5741793 latur was one of the biggest breeding grounds of chikunguniya so we had to do something after a survey of tirupati a prominent pilgrimage centre in tamil nadu which gets around 700 000 visitors everyday but still remains garbage free we decided to implement a door to door collection of garbage in the entire city of latur we also decided not to spend any money on garbage collection households would pay the monthly rs 20 towards the collection of garbage
5741794 interestingly while the slum dwellers were willing to part with rs 20 for collection of garbage this was not true of educated people in the city most people feel that it is the responsibility of the government to collect garbage
5741795 instead of working as garbage collectors our children now learn vocational courses like carpentry in the morning and go to school in the afternoon
5741796 we have decided to continue with door to door collection even after the contract comes to an end the rag pickers have collectively managed to save about rs 200 000 and have decided to set up a biomass project the deal has been signed with appropriate rural technology initiative arti of pune and the project is likely to start soon
5741797 most of the rag pickers are women and their husbands used to drink a lot this is no longer true now almost 75 per cent of them have stopped drinking
5741798 misschien heeft het te maken met de tijd van het jaar
5741799 op dit moment brengen veel legitieme virusbestrijders hun nieuwe software uit en de cybercriminelen proberen daar een graantje van mee te pikken

5741803 the way he moved it was a sin so sweet and true
5741804 every word of every song that he sang was for you in a flash he was gone it happened so soon what could you do
5741805 think of it like this one day youre using windows and wake up the next day and all your computers are running mac os x its still a computer its still fundamentally the same experience but it works a bit more logically and you dont get in trouble as often its not foolproof but its a bit better
5741806 see see hes no different hes just another politician dont you feel like a chump now
5741807 we wanted to do something really different with the house of the dead overkill
5741808 with sega weve been able to create a fresh look for the franchise i think youll agree its like nothing youve seen before on wii
5741809 paying homage to the pulp horror comics and films that inspired generations of gore fans the house of the dead overkill will expose gamers to a brand new fleshy rollercoaster ride of revolting dismemberment
5741810 this is the hardcore wii title youve been waiting for

5741824 i would not predict how evangelicals are going to vote i will tell you theyre not monolith thats a big myth theyre going to make up their minds based on the hierarchy of their values
5741825 for many evangelicals of course if they believe that life begins at conception thats a deal breaker for a lot of people because if they think that life begins at conception then that means that there are 40 million americans who are not here because they were aborted that could have voted they would call that a holocaust and for them it would like if im jewish and a holocaust denier is running for office i dont care how right he is on everything else its a deal breaker for me im not going to vote for a holocaust denier
5741826 i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come

5741840 if you compare him to the alternatives such as a liberal democrat hes great
5741841 if you compare him to what conservatives would like he doesnt look so good
5741842 im hard pressed to name even a single conservative on his staff
5741843 i expressed a personal opinion ive never been part of any effort to do that and wont be this year
5741844 i got by with a little help from my friends
5741845 where is that b ch man ill f ing batter her
5741846 this is not an attack upon the practices of shia muslims we rely upon guidance by senior members
5741847 this is about the defendant urging these boys to use an adult zanjeer which was clearly going to cause injury
5741848 were hopeful that the entire eastside community will take advantage of this opportunity to obtain important health information and screenings and in addition enjoy the family fun fair
5741849 obviously if rigor mortis has set in where andrews cant move and hes susceptible to injury then im not going to put him in
5741850 i want to just see how it all works out where hes at
5741851 i had me a good john grisham book going on
5741852 actually right when we got on the plane for pittsburgh i opened it up and i finished it right as we got to the stadium that was a quick turnaround for me to read a book so i was just sitting around reading flipping pages man and i didnt get my proper warmup in
5741853 when a question is asked you answer it and you try to answer it correctly
5741854 thats the way he felt and he expressed that some people cant take it some people dont understand what hes talking about
5741855 jimmy is a good friend of mine its sad that he has to go through something like this but im sure hell pull himself out of it
5741856 its the start of a change in tactics in dealing with crowd control and dispersing violent demonstrations and violent instances
5741857 they wanted to put two bags in and each bag weighed a kilo
5741858 i finally let them put one bag in with the plan being that i would feel better in the morning and cut weight then
5741859 i tried to get out of the sauna but my teammates were holding me down i finally stormed out with my last bit of strength and i collapsed right there i went into convulsions
5741860 then it was like we could put some mats in the barn and it would be good for the girls
5741861 they could run around in there and play all kinds of games they could play indoor soccer in there it would be fun for them
5741862 doctors always tell us not to do it but boxers judokas wrestlers we all do it anyway
5741863 what is impressive to me is not that she came back after all these years
5741864 what is impressive to me is how she trains you can see every time she trains she trains her hardest she pushes herself she does everything you ask her to do every exercise
5741865 people try to make that connection all the time that its unfinished business for me and maybe subconsciously its there
5741866 but when i think about that time i think about it as a different time i think about it like two separate careers
5741867 i really dont feel like i have ghosts from the past

5741872 yo trabajo en este sector y literalmente tengo que salir corriendo hasta la estaci n hospital en las horas de la tarde para evitar que me atraquen adem s tengo que ir acompa ada
5741873 anteriormente la polic a patrullaba nuestras calles pero este a o no los hemos visto qu ocurre
5741874 en este lugar hay varios habitantes de la calle responsables de vandalismo robos a las personas que pasan por all hurto de cables del tel fono entre otras actividades que generan inseguridad en el barrio
5741875 en la calle 72 con la carrera 45 se est n presentando muchos atracos adem s de esto los atracadores est n hiriendo a la gente con cuchillos la gente est asustada
5741876 lo m s importante para nosotros es que la ciudadan a denuncie los hechos que se est n presentando
5741877 tenemos la polic a comunitaria que ha trabajado con excelentes resultados en distintos sectores tambi n tenemos los cai y la l nea de atenci n de emergencias 123 los medios existen hay que usarlos
5741878 muchas veces nos quedamos sin elementos para poder retener a una persona sospechosa de robos hay que denunciar los hechos que ocurren en la ciudad
5741879 creo que aqu hay un gran reto para la competitividad de nuestros pa ses impedir que la inflaci n que se est presentando en esta coyuntura tenga efectos sicol gicos y tambi n impedir que la inflaci n nos lleve a la par lisis de la econom a
5741880 el reto no es distribuir la pobreza sino construir prosperidad
5741881 contrariamente a lo que piensan radicalismos ideol gicos que el comercio agrava la inequidad social la pr ctica ha demostrado que el comercio internacional es un est mulo a la equidad social
5741882 la experiencia nos ha indicado que hay que insistir en lo tradicional pero hay que agregar valor
5741883 la globalizaci n tiene que ser equitativa con justicia social de lo contrario se vuelve confrontaci n
5741884 estas cifras a primera vista muestran una balanza comercial positiva para colombia pero cuando se extrae de las cuentas el valor del petr leo exportado a estados unidos se perciben unas cifras negativas
5741885 nosotros no necesitamos tratados de libre comercio para vender caf nosotros no necesitamos tratados de comercio para vender carb n seguramente en el futuro no vamos a necesitar tratados de comercio para vender biocombustibles
5741886 las ni as todav a no comprenden la magnitud de este abuso ellas me preguntan si eso que l les hizo es bueno o malo pero yo s lo trato de que no se traumaticen
5741887 debido a que la cifra solicitada por cemex es muy alta muy por encima de los 1 300 millones de d lares

5741929 the mutation that causes most cases of wilson disease is well known but our study looks at the overall puzzle to see how such a small mutation can alter the shape and function of such a large and complex protein
5741930 this mutation occurs at a crucial location where the protein typically binds with a molecule called atp that provides the energy the protein needs to move copper from place to place
5741931 past studies have compared the behavior of the mutant protein with that of the nonmutant and found very little difference so it was unclear how this small change led to the devastating effects that are seen in wilson disease
5741932 these national numbers for chronic lead poisoning are staggering but the percentage of affected children in older urban areas is much much higher than in rural areas or newer cities the blowing soil and dust young children ingest contains large amount of lead from lead paint and leaded gasoline deposited decades ago and from industrial contamination in indianapolis we found high levels of soil contamination many older urban centers have lead poisoning rates that are 5 to10 times the national average
5741933 our review plus the new directions we suggest for remoisturizing soil to prevent blowing of contaminants confirm that our approach to estimating lead burden and its remediation can be done anywhere in the u s where there is a lead concern the environmental protection agency and the u s department of housing and urban have focused their attention on indoor contamination as the direct source of lead to children it is now time to open the door and solve the contaminated soil problem we hope our study will raise awareness and ultimately funding to stop the poisoning of americas children especially those living in older urban areas

5742026 however the group is of the view that given the strong underlying economic fundamentals and continued growth trends in china the continual demand for real estate properties remains
5742027 so far we have seen continued strong support to a lot of our regional points
5742028 i think this year there are some challenges fuel being one of them but that is part and parcel of the business

5742037 rubber smallholders for example with the right fertiliser and pesticide have the potential to more than double natural rubber output to 2 500kg per hectare per year

5742043 self respect is the fruit of discipline the sense of dignity grows with the ability to say no to oneself
5742044 theres only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving and thats your own self

5742046 a man who doesnt trust himself can never really trust anyone else
5742047 i think somehow we learn who we really are and then live with that decision
5742048 the worst lonliness is to not be comfortable with yourself
5742049 self respect is a question of recognizing that anything worth having has a price

5742067 despite higher raw material costs the company still managed to keep a tight rein on rising costs while raising overall productivity within the group
5742068 likewise the strategy of promoting our khind and mistral brands in hypermarkets had also paid off handsomely
5742069 this new channel of distribution allowed khind to capitalise on an untapped market segment that has seen very good response supporting our presence in the hypermarkets was an increase in marketing and promotional efforts
5742070 our ongoing effort to optimise raw material usage and reduce production costs will certainly help the company maintain profitability in light of rising material costs
5742071 however external factors such as the price volatility of crude oil and any potential softening of the world economy remains a concern

5742280 so i think obviously were going to have to judge how the parliamentary agenda is unfolding
5742281 his passing on is a sad day to the zimbabwean people
5742282 it is with deep sorrow that i have to tell the people of zambia that our president has passed away this morning

5742284 some political parties are disrupting this peace all peace loving zambians must rise and say no to all those preaching violence and chaos in this country

5742316 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5742317 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane
5742318 i still dont see why radical left wing people in nyc think that there is any reason to work for the obama campaign so i am posting up a little piece of excellent flame bait
5742319 no one can see you you have only yourself to look to you are going to be completely isolated when you make your decision and afterwards you can hide that decision or lie about it
5742320 the small shopkeepers would not help us any more than the country people would

5742322 he swore in the name of allah and in accordance to the teachings of islam and as advised by religious scholars and teachers that i was sodomised by anwar ibrahim
5742323 ive taken this oath to prove that my allegations are completely true allah is the only place where i can complain to
5742324 ive done this for god and i do not wish to lie to the world as he anwar has done
5742325 ive not been hiding but i was quietly gathering enough courage to answer all the allegations against me especially by anwar ibrahim it needs mental and spiritual strength as taking an oath is not something trivial or easy the consequences can be very dire in the eyes of god nevertheless allah has given me the strength to take the oath today
5742326 this is not a political matter it is a private matter between me and anwar ibrahim
5742327 i always try to write on the principle of the iceberg

5742399 innovation is the path to massive quantities of cleaner cheaper energy the people were funding today have a real shot at lowering the cost of egs and bringing us closer to our goal of renewable energy cheaper than coal
5742400 egs is critical to the clean electricity revolution we need to solve the climate crisis but egs hasnt received the attention it merits thats why were pressing for expanded support from government and increased investment from the private sector
5742401 were big believers in egs and were looking for more opportunities

5742419 microsoft has invested heavily in creating datacenters as have others in the industry but to keep them running at an optimal level is a constant challenge
5742420 dcell a scalable and fault tolerant network structure for data centers
5742421 the idea is to get rid of many of the switches inside datacenters do the routing at the edges the servers themselves and let them create a mesh inside the datacenter so packets can move quickly
5742422 its a notion that could reduce the cost of building and operating large datacenters tremendously
5742423 the reality is that end users are the ones who are actually using the services
5742424 when you do a live search that search is executed inside a datacenter when you look at live maps or run exchange from a web site all of these services are running on computers inside the datacenters how do we ensure that when you click on something immediately the answer comes back how do we bring the cost down how do we increase reliability
5742425 the price you pay is the price we pay not a cent more
5742426 we have 100 years of innovation behind us but whats ahead is even more exciting

5742596 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5742597 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5742598 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction

5742616 from the time work media first began managing my adwords campaign our cost per conversion when a prospect fills out a request for proposal declined more than 36 so we are getting more requests for the same amount of money

5742619 we have met with families in which for weeks together not an article of sustenance but potatoes had been used yet for every child the hard earned sum was provided to send them to school

5742622 the mine went off and caused a huge explosion killing five children and three other people passing near by
5742623 we sent the children to the mosque to attend friday prayers but they stopped on the way and started playing football before they died in the explosion
5742624 after the killing of our officers we were given some of the names of the murderers we tracked them down immediately and captured these two guys who were later convicted of being the killers
5742625 they wanted to undermine the peace process and they missed their target and killed children
5742626 they were the heaviest attacks so far on the troops
5742627 it is a total fabrication and the intention of the report is to depict it as if there is a proxy war between eritrea and ethiopia
5742628 the sounds of gunfire rocked our entire residence and created fear among us
5742629 terrorists and remnants of the courts and insurgents who are not happy with any kind of administration in somalia are always behind such attacks
5742630 they were killed when an artillery round landed on their house
5742631 another two children of the same family and their uncle were wounded
5742632 we have not received any weapons from eritrea weapons are in abundance in somalia

5742636 the campaign is aimed at ending illegal businesses built on the streets to help police perform security patrols and to revive the lost image of the capital said mohamed dheere

5742639 express logics threadx rtos support for the powerpc440 hard processor in virtex 5 fxt fpgas enables designers to better address deeply embedded applications in the communications medical aerospace and defense markets
5742640 since threadx rtos also supports the microblaze soft processor in virtex and spartan fpgas developers can use it as a common embedded software platform reducing development and maintenance costs
5742641 evaluating the threadx rtos on xc5vfx30t virtex 5 platforms provides users with a flexible environment to investigate the benefits of express logics multitasking solution
5742642 we are seeing strong interest in xilinxs fpga solutions for demanding real time embedded applications

5742650 do 254 certifiable ip is a huge productivity gain for our customers who have to comply with the do 254 standard
5742651 now instead of having to reverse engineer or re develop a commonly used component companies can actually reap the productivity benefit of off the shelf certifiable networking and processor ip with the confidence of knowing that it supports the design assurance needs of their flows and thus does not present a certification risk
5742652 dealing with cots ip under the guidance of do 254 has been one of the industrys biggest challenges to date im excited to see vendors like altera and mentor taking the initiative to address a very important aspect of these flows to make cots ip compliant with do 254 their efforts could save hardware applicants a lot of resources and frustration
5742653 working with altera on do 254 certifiable ip is the next step for us in supporting the needs of this market
5742654 mentor recognized the importance of do 254 at its inception and has been investing in solutions for do 254 certification for several years this initiative lets us leverage both our methodology expertise and tools to not only provide the industry with high quality ip but also the tool and methodology guidance that many are seeking

5742712 pakistani president pervez musharraf bowed to domestic and international pressure and quit monday but his departure could trigger further instability for the nuclear armed u s ally if the countrys fractious coalition government cant hold together without its common enemy
5742713 the resignation of president pervez musharraf will force pakistans untested new civilian government to confront a dizzying array of problems chief among them an intensifying battle against islamic insurgents in the nations long lawless tribal areas
5742714 the decision removes from pakistans political stage the leader who for nearly nine years served as one of the united states most important and ultimately unreliable allies

5742733 only 43 5 of basic commercial food import needs were met during the period between 3 and 30 december 2007
5742734 the stranglehold on gazas borders has made the work of the un and other humanitarian agencies virtually impossible only a trickle of medicine food fuel and other goods is being allowed in the israeli blockade of gaza has made people highly dependent on food aid and brought the health system and basic services such as water and sanitation near to collapse

5742748 the global economic downturn is affecting economies across the world and clearly scotland cannot be fully insulated from its effects
5742749 but there are two reasons why the economic outlook for scotland is positive
5742750 first the scottish economy continues to show encouraging signs of resilience second scotland has a government that despite its limited economic powers will take decisive action to strengthen our performance and prospects

5742758 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5742759 i know why labour is using it ive seen the focus groups too people like the word fair
5742760 they think government is unfair to those who work hard and play by the rules they want a fair deal and fair play
5742761 and when youre in trouble as a political party there is a temptation to cling desperately to the words that focus groups throw up
5742762 i remember an attempted conservative relaunch in 2003 was based on the theme a fair deal for everyone it was not a great success indeed we lost our party leader that autumn
5742763 we are currently on course to leave that next generation a higher national debt and the highest budget deficit of any major economy in the world
5742764 and far from changing course all the leaks and briefings coming out of the downing street at the moment suggest that the prime minister is preparing to try to buy his way out of trouble by bribing people with their own borrowed money
5742765 leaving our children to pay our debts is not fair we already know that we face a rising bill over the years to come from our ageing population
5742766 to add to the bill gross fiscal irresponsibility is not just economically reckless it is deeply unfair on future generations
5742767 we need to develop a new fiscal framework to replace the busted fiscal rules that were supposed to protect us from the short term spending sprees of politicians out to save their own skin a framework that fairly protects the interests of the next generation
5742768 we have discovered that state attempts to guarantee fairness through monopoly provision by monolithic public services turns out to be as unfair as previous ideas of 98 tax rates and forced equality of outcome
5742769 so if monopoly state provision is not the answer what is
5742770 evidence from around the world shows that just as a broad consensus now exists that we should be free to make our own choices and to innovate in the private sphere so we must trust choice competition in provision and local decision making in public services
5742771 the labour party is delighted that the battle is to be joined on fairness when we are fighting a tory party that for all the talk of change is still committed to the old unfair policies
5742772 this is the same tory party that opposed the minimum wage opposed pension credit and the winter fuel allowance opposed support for families through tax credits and still wont commit to any real pledge on child poverty and this is the same shadow chancellor whose flagship tax policy diverts 1bn to the 3 000 richest estates in the country

5742774 similarly if a teacher has a low ability class assigning more homework may help since they may not have been pushed hard enough but for the average achieving classes who may have been given too much homework in an attempt to equate them with the high achieving classes educators could be better served by using other methods to improve student achievement given these students abilities and time constraints learning by doing may be a more effective tool for improvement
5742775 this does not mean that homework is unimportant for average achievers
5742776 but it does mean that this population may also benefit from other activities such as sports art or music rather than additional hours of math homework
5742777 teachers should consider quality over quantity when it comes to homework assignments
5742778 in the end it should be up to the individual teacher to decide how to motivate and educate their students
5742779 i want people throughout the country to know the barack obama i know
5742780 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition
5742781 i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same

5742809 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5742810 so basically i had prophylactic double mastectomies people would say three weeks ago
5742811 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me and so this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5742812 this technique is really the first time that cancer surgeons can see structures that are otherwise invisible providing if were able to see cancer we have a chance of curing it
5742813 we know that in wales we have more people with long term illnesses than england
5742814 these figures reflect the fact that more preventative work is being undertaken with gps prescribing medicines which are helping people manage their chronic conditions and keeping them out of hospital reducing the cost and pressure on the nhs
5742815 we are also issuing more medicines used to treat cancers as cancer therapy has improved to a point where for a number of patients it is now a chronic condition plus gps are helping more patients with diabetes manage their condition under the new enhanced contract
5742816 the figures also show we are increasing access while reducing costs the net cost per prescription item decreased from 9 80 to 9 42
5742817 we warned the assembly government that giving free prescriptions for all would be disastrous and todays figures have vindicated our position
5742818 a 5 increase in items claimed is disastrous when the assembly government is refusing to fund vital lifesaving drugs
5742819 the cost of this gimmick will be with welsh patients for generations
5742820 while millionaires claim their free paracetamol the health service will continue to be to stretched to provide life saving services
5742821 the number of prescriptions being issued for cardiovascular problems for example has risen by 141 5 and these are often for the largest most expensive items
5742822 rather than micro managing the nhs the assembly government should be looking at improving the nations health
5742823 that would permit with a warrant the government to gain access to encrypted data without the permission of the keyholder s hal supported safe but today said that the best ways to implement the values of privacy arent so much in worrying about who has

5742827 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy so basically i had a prophylactic double mastectomies

5742832 our wish our object our chief preoccupation must be to form jesus in ourselves to make his spirit his devotion his affections his desires and his disposition live and reign there all our religious exercises should be directed to this end it is the work which god has given us to do unceasingly
5742833 i ask you to consider that our lord jesus christ is our true head and that you are one of his members he belongs to you as the head belongs to its members all that is his is yours you must make use of all these as of your own to serve praise love and glorify god

5742859 by all criteria of modern molecular biology life is present from the moment of conception
5742860 it is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception
5742861 i have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception
5742862 to accept the fact that after fertilization has taken place a new human has come into being is no longer a matter of taste or opinion it is plain experimental evidence

5742886 older adults who consumed tuna or other baked or broiled fish had a lower risk of having abnormalities on brain mris
5742887 we didnt find any association with eating fried fish and having lower rates of these abnormalities
5742888 the message to the public is to eat more fish that has higher levels of omega 3 fatty acids rather than eating more fried fish
5742889 this may be related to the more than one factor analogous to the mediterranean diet that is also rich in fish and fruits and vegetables and has been frequently associated with less cardiovascular risk

5742894 madame speaker we ask you to work with us to help americans feeling pain at the pump by developing more american energy
5742895 if you refuse we simply ask you get out of the way and allow us to help the people that sent us here they understand how flawed and out of touch your caucus is on energy issues and so do we
5742896 i agree with the presidents decision to release oil from the strategic petroleum reserve to help replenish supply shortages resulting from hurricane katrina
5742897 catastrophic events like hurricane katrina are the reason the strategic petroleum reserve was created and releasing oil at this time is appropriate but to truly provide americans relief from skyrocketing oil prices we must get serious about decreasing americas dangerous dependence on foreign oil by increasing fuel efficiency and investing more in the renewable fuels that can lead us down the path to energy independence

5742917 abdel rahman b abu amra reported uthman b affan raa entered the mosque after the evening prayer and sat alone i came and sat with him so he said o son of my brother i heard the messenger of allah may peace be upon him saying he who observed the isha prayer in congregation it was as if he prayed up to the midnight and he who prayed the morning prayer in a congregation it was as if he prayed the whole night
5742918 simak b harb raa reported i said to b samura did you sit in the company of the messenger of allah may peace be upon him he said yes very often he the holy prophet used to sit at the place where he observed the morning or dawn prayer till the sun rose or when it had risen he would stand and they the companions would talk about matters pertaining to the days of ignorance and they would laugh on these matters while the holy prophet only smiled
5742919 according to another hadith if a person offers fajr salaat in congregation and remains engaged in zikr of allah until sunrise and then offers two rakaat of nafl salaat his reward will equal that of a perfect hajj and umrah
5742920 abu tharr raa reported that allahs messenger may peace be upon him had said in the morning charity is due from every bone in the body of every one of you every utterance of allahs glorification is an act of charity every utterance of praise of him is an act of charity every utterance of profession of his oneness is an act of charity enjoining good is an act of charity forbidding what is disputable is an act of charity and two bows with one prays in the forenoon prayer will suffice
5742921 abdullah ibn amr says the messenger of allah may peace be upon him sent an expedition and they obtained lots of booty and returned quickly
5742922 according to a hadith one who reads surah tabakallazi and alif lam mim sajdah between maghrib dusk salaat and the isha salaat is like a person who stands in salaat throughout the night called lailatul ul qadr
5742923 ibn abbas raa reported that while gabriel was sitting with the apostle sas he heard a creaking sound above him
5742924 those who regularly perform the tahajjud prayers are the righteous and are more deserving of allahs bounty and mercy
5742925 jabir rah said he heard allahs messenger may peace be upon him who said there is an hour during the night in which no muslim individual will ask allah for good in this world and the next without his giving it to him and that applies in every night
5742926 abu huraira reported what allahs messenger may peace be upon him had said allah descends every night to the lowest heaven when one third of the latter part of the night is left and says who supplicates for me so that i may answer him who asks me so that i may give him who asks me forgiveness so that i may forgive him

5743027 fuel raises the bar in terms of scale and exhilaration for racing games we begin with the largest racing environment to appear in gaming ever with our accelerated effects of climate change and dynamic weather system we add an extra dimension that change races on the fly and constantly presents new challenges to players
5743028 player choice lies at the heart of fuels action packed races and with a huge range of vehicles packs of up to 16 vehicles speeding across diverse terrain and a no boundaries no limits approach to racing means players have never had so much freedom to conquer the wilderness and take the chequered flag
5743029 the technology asobo studios has developed to build fuel is ground breaking to create a game on this unprecedented scale to this level of graphical quality complete with all the dynamic weather effects is a great achievement
5743030 fuel had to be a special title for codemasters to include in our racing portfolio and we believe that from both a gameplay and a technical perspective fuel compliments our long standing tradition of driving excellence

5743035 we are not getting as many guests during this olympic period as everyone expected
5743036 maybe it is because more hotels have opened maybe its because hotels have greatly increased their room rates
5743037 the benefits of the number of people attending the games is expected to be largely offset by reduced business activity during the olympic period

5743100 one explanation might be that theres a group of consumers thats holding off making do with the devices that they have either because of larger economic concerns or because they dont see any value yet in the new voice and data services that are driving some of these new handsets
5743101 we are working very hard to make mobileme a great service we can all be proud of we know that mobilemes launch has not been our finest hour and we truly appreciate your patience as we turn this around

5743103 probably the examining attorney did not suspect that this was a generic term so he or she didnt search for it
5743104 that creates a situation that has the potential for pto to miss a term that is considered generic in a specific industry

5743110 well you shouldnt wait for your wife im sure shes tired from work

5743113 the site would be much better if only the avatars were moved from bottom to top of the posts
5743114 enough about me lets talk about you what do you think of me
5743115 i know why labour is using it ive seen the focus groups too people like the word fair
5743116 they think government is unfair to those who work hard and play by the rules they want a fair deal and fair play
5743117 and when youre in trouble as a political party there is a temptation to cling desperately to the words that focus groups throw up
5743118 i remember an attempted conservative relaunch in 2003 was based on the theme a fair deal for everyone it was not a great success indeed we lost our party leader that autumn
5743119 we are currently on course to leave that next generation a higher national debt and the highest budget deficit of any major economy in the world
5743120 and far from changing course all the leaks and briefings coming out of the downing street at the moment suggest that the prime minister is preparing to try to buy his way out of trouble by bribing people with their own borrowed money
5743121 leaving our children to pay our debts is not fair we already know that we face a rising bill over the years to come from our ageing population
5743122 to add to the bill gross fiscal irresponsibility is not just economically reckless it is deeply unfair on future generations
5743123 we need to develop a new fiscal framework to replace the busted fiscal rules that were supposed to protect us from the short term spending sprees of politicians out to save their own skin a framework that fairly protects the interests of the next generation
5743124 we have discovered that state attempts to guarantee fairness through monopoly provision by monolithic public services turns out to be as unfair as previous ideas of 98 tax rates and forced equality of outcome
5743125 so if monopoly state provision is not the answer what is
5743126 evidence from around the world shows that just as a broad consensus now exists that we should be free to make our own choices and to innovate in the private sphere so we must trust choice competition in provision and local decision making in public services
5743127 the labour party is delighted that the battle is to be joined on fairness when we are fighting a tory party that for all the talk of change is still committed to the old unfair policies
5743128 this is the same tory party that opposed the minimum wage opposed pension credit and the winter fuel allowance opposed support for families through tax credits and still wont commit to any real pledge on child poverty and this is the same shadow chancellor whose flagship tax policy diverts 1bn to the 3 000 richest estates in the country

5743147 it requires a lot less power from your desktop computers and puts less of a strain on your infrastructure
5743148 there are a limited number of slots available and the retailer partner margin takes a significant part of the overall revenue but since were selling virtual goods with high margins we believe the increase in revenue is worth the transactional cost
5743149 cc metro for coke and cosmogirl village are fairly large entries into the virtual world
5743150 we believe that one of the reasons theres a backlash is that people were spending a fortune opening an island and no one was coming we think of that as opening a k swiss store in the real world you could just find other people to sell it
5743151 when people wear the virtual merchandise you still get brand exposure
5743152 and the lifetime is as long as people own the virtual good weve found brands like that especially when starting off we actually encourage that we want our customers to be successful for us to come in and sell our customers the moon and then not have them be successful isnt good for anyone
5743153 in many cases we have users who produce work that is as good as professional animators we put out an rfp and some of the users produced really great work

5743193 then obamas party leaders took him aside and set him straight they had an election plan and they werent about to have obama ruin that by working on both sides of the aisle to accomplish something substantive in 2006
5743194 at the middle part of the race the hurdles came up very fast
5743195 i wanted to keep things tight it was like racing a car at high velocity when you hit a curve you either maintain control of it or you crash and burn
5743196 im shocked and sad but i am happy for the other girls
5743197 its hurdles you have to clear all 10 or you are not a worthy champion
5743198 today is hard tomorrow will be harder i just have to get myself back up
5743199 im really sad i tried my best i kept telling myself to concentrate but i cant control what happens sometimes you just lose your mind
5743200 the last time i hit a hurdle was the day before the olympic trials
5743201 congratulations to them but its hard i thought i had it i really did
5743202 when i saw the photo finish i was all tingling

5743205 the smartest most sophisticated person i think i have ever met
5743206 oh god those things are nothing but a pain in the ass they break all the time and you have to get your water tested and youre not drinking out of the well are you
5743207 but i want one of those wells with a stone base and a long rope and a bucket
5743208 i could find some guys who would put one of those in for you just for the thrill of doing it but you know what that means
5743209 its about completing the task of living with enough spontaneity to splurge some of it on bystanders to share with others working through their own travails a little of your bonus life
5743210 despite the economic headwinds affecting the industry we are on track to sell more vehicles than we did last year and 2007 was already a record year for us
5743211 at a time when consumers are more hesitant in their purchasing decisions it is even more crucial to have convincing products
5743212 early reactions to our all new fiesta make us confident that we are adding another cornerstone to continue the upwards trend of the ford brand despite adverse economic conditions
5743213 i am very excited to join mini at this stage in its development

5743226 we had many enticing ideas and it wasnt easy for our selection committee
5743227 the trend seems to be exotic fusion flavors and concepts based on ethnic foods
5743228 the tie breaker for multiple entries with the same idea was a 50 word essay which is posted along with the flavor idea
5743229 this is product extension at its best where the new products ipod and iphone are helping bring new customers to existing computer products the fact that apple is not dependent on the windows vista operating system hasnt hurt either
5743230 egs expands the potential of geothermal energy by orders of magnitude
5743231 the traditional geothermal approach relies on finding naturally occurring pockets of steam and hot water the egs process by comparison replicates these conditions by fracturing hot rock circulating water through the system and using the resulting steam to produce electricity in a conventional turbine
5743232 a recent mit report on egs estimates that just 2 of the heat below the continental united states between 3 and 10 kilometers depths within the range of current drilling technology is more than 2 500 times the countrys total annual energy use

5743237 we are working to see that the face of health care is changing as well
5743238 blacks and latinos have much higher incidences of obesity heart disease diabetes and many other treatable and preventable health problems blacks and latinos also are often clustered in communities that are more toxic that have more health hazards present and yet also have significantly fewer health care providers in or near those communities our mission at the urban health program goes beyond just training black latino and native american health care providers we are dedicated to helping solve these disparities we encourage our students to work in the communities that need them most
5743239 the urban health program is a model for other colleges and universities around the country when it comes to attracting and graduating a cadre of black latino and native american students for the health professions
5743240 it just amazes me i dont see how the american public in the end gains by all of the theatrics
5743241 mr mandracchia and the others theyre all of good will and theyre a little frustrated by lawyers arguing
5743242 the last thing we want to do is prolong this
5743243 if we are finally permitted to put on our case we will show everyone we have a very strong case
5743244 theres nothing she could say that would make their case
5743245 a distraction from what were trying to do at the park

5743264 this type of behavior from a 42 year old woman who is supposed to be a positive role model and an educator of our young people is not just offensive to the norms of our community it is criminal as a result my office will see that she is held accountable for her actions in the criminal court system
5743265 this is unusual in that its almost 100 percent focused on featuring baltimore artists
5743266 it was the direction of the baltimore development corp and the baltimore hotel corp and hilton embraced it it helps create a visual memory of the place so people know theyre in baltimore and not another city
5743267 people will stop and look and ask what is this about
5743268 having my artwork permanently displayed in the baltimore hilton convention hotel and being a part of a project dedicated to the belief in baltimore artists is an opportunity that i will forever cherish
5743269 our goal is to make early stage digital assets resemble their final on screen forms as closely as possible
5743270 starting with accurate models makes the production process more efficient and provides a higher quality end result for example youd want to know early on whether a prominent brow will shadow a characters eyes thats why autodesk mudbox 2009 has texture painting tools and on target display features which will help artists build and refine better 3d models
5743271 the introduction of autodesk mudbox 2009 sparks a revolution in computer graphics tools bringing about a paradigm shift in how designers and artists do their work
5743272 time is money an autodesk mudbox session begins with its artist friendly intuitive interface this is sculpting at the speed of thought with the greatest of fidelity in a business where new ideas with impossible deadlines are commonplace mudbox never lets me down

5743277 well last night two women asked me to sign their beavers
5743278 they both had those i think you call them beanie babies
5743279 i had nothing to do with the starting of camra but i joined early on id already traveled quite a bit as a journalist and id tasted interesting beers in other countries particularly i was very aware of the belgian traditions and to some extent the german tradition i thought its very good that camra is fighting for british tradition but what about the tradition of these other countries i think the motivation was almost like the motivation of some of those musicologists like alan lomax who went down to the mississippi delta in the 50s and recorded old blues men before they died i wanted to kind of record belgian beer before those breweries didnt exist anymore i certainly didnt see it as a career possibility but i think all or many journalists have in them a sort of element of being an advocate
5743280 the decision is being made as a result of the publics expression that they just cant get it done in an hour
5743281 we should have had this memorial in front of all the athletes sponsored by the ioc
5743282 this is not an israeli issue this concerns the whole olympic family
5743283 nations that are not willing to condemn terrorism openly or refuse to compete against other nations because of their nationality or race or religion they should not be part of the olympics its contrary to the olympic ideal
5743284 the blackest event in the long history of the olympic games
5743285 athletes coaches and judges of your country who came to the olympic games to compete in peace and harmony

5743294 we are very excited to receive this gift of the books and papers of the beer hunter the michael jackson collection will work in parallel with the national brewing library already located in oxford brookes university library and jointly managed by members of the library and the institute of brewing amp distilling it will also complement other special collections in food and drink one of the key areas of research excellence in the university
5743295 most people have to wait until they reach 75 before they get a free tv licence and pensioners will be furious to learn that the former prime minister was getting his paid for by the taxpayer
5743296 the public will be alarmed to hear that they are paying essentially to keep mps for large parts of their working years to cover their food to cover their council tax and to insulate them from the kind of cost pressures that ordinary people feel
5743297 because restaurants can open up without any prior approval or licensing there will always be a percentage that dont comply
5743298 ive come across rat and cockoach infestations as well as kitchens that are just filthy
5743299 rats can contaminate food quite seriously with just their general activity because of the nature of where they actually live down drains and sewers they can bring all manner of harmful bacteria into a kitchen situation
5743300 it is very important that all food businesses obey the law and supply food that is safe to eat
5743301 we are in the middle of fighting to get our school sorted out and weve got north lanarkshire spending millions of pounds on outside consultants when they refuse to speak to the local people who are obviously the best consultants for the local area
5743302 its a colossal amount of money and i think questions have to be asked whether it is value for money
5743303 theres a real lack of transparency and accountability about how this money has been spent and the question also must be asked why on earth are we spending over 100 000 on the salaries of so many directors if so much is having to be farmed out and cant be done in house
5743304 i think this massive increase in the use of consultants is very worrying at a time when councils are strapped for cash
5743305 in edinburgh weve had a number of large capital projects that have come on stream and weve had to get in consultants for that
5743306 in addition i would argue that getting consultants in on the short term can actually save you money in the longer term because theyre only there on the bill for the amount of time they do the job
5743307 if we brought somebody in longer term that cost would be with us for the longer term so were actually getting smarter about how we employ people or engage people to work for the council
5743308 a number of years ago we took a decision to convert what we had previously been spending on agency nurses into permanent nursing staff posts as we believe it delivers a better quality of service to our patients
5743309 the trust operates with very few nursing vacancies and the use of external temporary nursing staff is only considered once all other options have been exhausted
5743310 2007 8 has been a period of growth for the trust and it has undertaken significant extra work to achieve 18 week waiting time targets
5743311 to do this effectively it has needed to increase its staffing levels and this has included using some agency staff during the adjustment period the 430 000 represents only 0 4 of the trusts overall spend of 97m on staff
5743312 the trusts are ensuring that not everyone takes their annual leave at the same time
5743313 canadians havent stopped borrowing however and thats a divergence that just cant last the mortgage market has expanded 13 4 per cent over the past year and consumer credit has grown more than 10 per cent both growth rates are far above recent averages even though canadian economic growth has ground to a halt if consumer behaviour were to continue on that kind of track canada would no doubt be in store for a dangerous credit bubble mr tal said ottawa has decided to essentially ban 40 year mortgages as of mid october a decision that some financial institutions have already implemented on their own said craig alexander deputy chief economist at toronto dominion bank
5743314 hampshire county council is the third largest shire authority in the country serving over 1 2 million people with a budget of 640m excluding schools and around 39 000 staff
5743315 we would expect to be spending more on bottled water than other authorities that are not comparable in size
5743316 however we accept that we need to reduce our use of bottled water to save money and be more sustainable
5743317 our staff are entitled to reasonable access to fresh drinking water but not all have access to kitchen facilities
5743318 bottled water is unnecessary expensive and damaging to the environment
5743319 she didnt have the characteristics of someone who was dead in her eyes it was almost as if there was some soul there
5743320 i started giving her heart massage and after a couple of moments she took an intake of breath i noticed there was some shallow breathing i didnt panic but i was very shocked
5743321 ive thought about what it must have appeared to him the doctor told him that his mother was dead and he comes into the room and there are two police officers one astride his mother
5743322 at the same time there was a knock at the door and i can only imagine it was the undertaker
5743323 if we hadnt recognised the fact she was alive i am absolutely sure that the undertaker would have come upstairs
5743324 she would have been placed in a coffin and taken to the mortuary and placed in a fridge she would almost definitely have died as a result
5743325 there have been some near misses where people have woken up in a body bag in the morgue so it is very likely that others have been buried alive
5743326 these are cases where doctors havent spent enough time confirming death the vast majority of diagnoses are obvious and clear and there are very few exceptions
5743327 all doctors are very well trained in diagnosing death and spend a lot of time making the correct diagnosis people should not be worried about these extremely rare events
5743328 i was in a management position and i had my desk taken away i had my office taken away i was asked to go back into uniform and had demeaning comments made
5743329 in the health service we carried out a survey among community practitioners and we found that about 50 of the workforce either witnessed bullying or experienced bullying over a 12 month period
5743330 that clearly is a very high percentage therefore we recognise the fact that management need to put in proper systems to address this issue
5743331 we recognise that tackling bullying must be a priority if we are to make the nhs an employer of choice
5743332 where it is clear our policies have not been correctly followed we always undertake a management investigation and disciplinary action is taken when appropriate
5743333 many of them just dont appreciate how important and sensitive they are
5743334 there have been no injuries as a result of these incidents
5743335 it must be noted that as london underground upgrades its signal system a part of its signal system as part of its current rebuilding program these incidents will be eliminated by the implementation of automatic train operation
5743336 they should sell these off and theyd be worth an absolute fortune
5743337 sure they have to mothball housing but they dont have to leave it empty
5743338 it provides housing for a group of people who otherwise dont get housed and for the military its got someone living on site taking care of it
5743339 were talking about the most senior professionals in welsh local government
5743340 these people have been in local government for many years theyre hugely experienced
5743341 they run something like over 200 functions including education and social services they employ something like 165 000 people
5743342 these are top jobs and you require the best people to do them
5743343 i think we see welsh local authorities offering great value for money
5743344 we see professionals paid a good wage to do a very important and onerous job

5743375 the russian military has effective control of the gori region making it responsible for the security and well being of all people living there

5743506 mr dion has indicated that the government should be defeated but hes not sure when hell do that because he hasnt got good enough polls i dont think thats a particularly responsible position
5743507 polls do indicate that the next election is in all likelihood a minority one way or the other
5743508 the fact of the matter is what i will have to decide over the next few weeks is whether or not we can have a productive fall session of parliament or whether in fact the government a government needs a new mandate
5743509 they have no intention of respecting the fixed election date
5743510 so i think obviously were going to have to judge how the parliamentary agenda is unfolding

5743516 i know it sounds crazy and a lot of people will criticise me for it but i have to pay the bills at the end of the day
5743517 and if i do face cancer i need to make sure i can support the boys
5743518 its really hard not knowing im trying to block out thinking about it trying not to get too depressed
5743519 this time it was awful because when its happened before ive been around people i started getting really bad pain like contraction pains in your abdomen but also lower down
5743520 i was sitting on the sofa and got up to do something and i was just bent over in pain i went up to the bathroom and thats when i saw the bleeding and clotting
5743521 i tried to get into my bedroom to call the ambulance there was just blood everywhere and i started to panic about how to open the security gates and let the paramedics in
5743522 i managed to get down the stairs but i was in so much pain they gave me morphine and air in the ambulance
5743523 i didnt know but im actually allergic to morphine and it made me have really bad claustrophobia i couldnt breathe it felt like i had worms scratching under my skin my eyes were rolling back
5743524 at one point i had about 10 doctors around me and all i could see were blurred faces looking down at me
5743525 it took a whole day for them to get the morphine out of my system and i was on a drip with an oxygen mask
5743526 i thought this time i need to know why this keeps happening
5743527 i have had two cancer scares before but this time they said jade there is a strong chance
5743528 after i had the miscarriage doctors warned me getting pregnant again could be a real health risk for me
5743529 they have told me twice i should even have a hysterectomy but i wouldnt let them
5743530 ive always dreamed of having a little girl one day it really bothers me to think maybe i wont be able to
5743531 its hard for the boys freddie knew i was in hospital and bobby knew i was unwell hes too young to understand but hes quite sensitive and he would have wanted to come in and stay with me

5743564 the recent attacks around kabul are good indicators that the taliban are reaching kabul

5743584 una vegada m s al govern catal a compar ixer davant del parlament per tal dexplicar quines van estar les seves actuacions en relaci a la fuita radioactiva a la central nuclear dasc
5743585 aquesta decisi corrobora la gravetat dels fets que en els darrers mesos hav em denunciat des de converg ncia i uni
5743586 retret una vegada m s a lexecutiu catal la seva passivitat davant de lincident m s greu que mai hagi patit cap central nuclear catalana
5743587 des del mes dabril quan es va con ixer lincident converg ncia i uni va demanat explicacions dels fets al govern catal aix com la compareixen a dels consellers castells i saura i de la presidenta del csn carmen mart nez ten davant el parlament de catalunya
5743588 hem presentat tot un seguit de propostes per tal que la generalitat de catalunya assumeixi compet ncies en l mbit del control de la seguretat nuclear
5743589 fins ara no han tingut resposta del govern de jos montilla
5743590 es va posar en evid ncia que el govern catal no va reaccionar i de forma poc contundent fins el 8 de maig
5743591 encara que la generalitat no tingui compet ncies en aquest mbit el seu govern ha destar emetent i sha implicar en tot el que succeeix en territori catal
5743592 demana una vegada m s als consellers castells i saura que compareguin davant del parlament i no samaguin darrere les decisions i la tasca del csm com han fet fins ara
5743593 zapatero no ha complert ni amb lestatut ni amb catalunya amb qui s que deu haver complert s amb el psoe ja que segurament els havia dit que aix del finan ament catal no tiraria endavant
5743594 en aquest dos anys lacord ja havia destar concretat per aplicar lo per s que a m s van presentar una proposta formal sense consist ncia i que no complia amb lestatut
5743595 tenien dos anys per endavant i no shi van posar fins ara fa un mes i mig
5743596 cert que som 17 per lestatut que s llei diu que nhi ha una catalunya que ha de tenir un acord bilateral que zapatero sespavili amb les altres
5743597 que els socialistes van aprovar un estatut que no es creien
5743598 ara s el moment ja que el moment de les negociacions ja ha passat i nom s queda un aspecte per concretar que s la quota de contribuci a la solidaritat que ha de fer catalunya
5743599 mentre el govern catal ens demana unitat i nosaltres complim ells van per separat en un tema com el de la compareixen a dins el propi tripartit cadasc va a la seva ja que ic i erc han anat per una banda i el psc per laltra
5743600 en plena crisi econ mica el govern central no es pot permetre no tenir aprovats els pge i prorrogar los seria una irresponsabilitat i una mostra de debilitat absoluta
5743601 fins a on est disposat a arribar el psc jo espero i desitjo que arribi fins a les ltimes conseq ncies i no es quedi en declaracions destiu a la premsa

5743604 aquestes comissions serien complement ries a les comissions locals dinformaci
5743605 per sort no sha detectat cap tipus de contaminaci radiol gica dimport ncia per a cap treballador ni per a cap de les persones que estiguin o hagin estat en contacte amb la central nuclear o en els seus voltants
5743606 hi ha una tranquil litat en la seguretat i s bo i positiu que ho diguem amb claredat no sha donat aquesta contaminaci radiol gica rellevant que pogu s posar en risc a les persones o al medi ambient
5743607 s necessari denunciar de quina manera la central nuclear ha ocultat dades que tenia des del mes de novembre i no els ha donat a con ixer fins al mes dabril i aix s greu i aix deu tenir unes conseq ncies en el sentit que est ocultaci de dades ha produ t una major alarma social

5743612 twenty per cent were ambivalent about saying that they were neither happy or unhappy
5743613 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
5743614 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5743615 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5743616 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
5743617 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt
5743618 we both tried to do some training along the lines of going down to our little gym but that was pretty much it
5743619 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses
5743620 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5743621 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5743622 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane

5743629 we know that in wales we have more people with long term illnesses than england
5743630 these figures reflect the fact that more preventative work is being undertaken with gps prescribing medicines which are helping people manage their chronic conditions and keeping them out of hospital reducing the cost and pressure on the nhs
5743631 we are also issuing more medicines used to treat cancers as cancer therapy has improved to a point where for a number of patients it is now a chronic condition plus gps are helping more patients with diabetes manage their condition under the new enhanced contract
5743632 the figures also show we are increasing access while reducing costs the net cost per prescription item decreased from 9 80 to 9 42
5743633 we warned the assembly government that giving free prescriptions for all would be disastrous and todays figures have vindicated our position
5743634 a 5 increase in items claimed is disastrous when the assembly government is refusing to fund vital lifesaving drugs
5743635 the cost of this gimmick will be with welsh patients for generations
5743636 while millionaires claim their free paracetamol the health service will continue to be to stretched to provide life saving services
5743637 the number of prescriptions being issued for cardiovascular problems for example has risen by 141 5 and these are often for the largest most expensive items
5743638 rather than micro managing the nhs the assembly government should be looking at improving the nations health

5743667 i have a team of core linux and jboss engineers here in the countries in which we operate to provide local language and local open source thinking outside the glass box

5743701 the russian military has effective control of the gori region making it responsible for the security and well being of all people living there
5743702 russia should prevent any further militia attacks and allow humanitarian aid to reach the hundreds of vulnerable civilians still in the area including many elderly
5743703 there are about 60 people mostly elderly remaining in the village we are hiding in the gardens and in the forest our relatives learned that three houses in our village were looted and burned by ossetians and we are scared that they will come for us as well many of us want to leave but we are scared to do so we are afraid that if we try to leave ossetians will kidnap us
5743704 the russian military should immediately establish a safe corridor to and from gori
5743705 no one should be forced to leave their homes but those who wish to leave should be able to do so safely humanitarian relief workers should be allowed in to assist those who chose to remain or are unable to leave

5743712 ik ben nooit in de koers gekomen ik heb geprobeerd om snel te starten maar ik heb de overgang niet gemaakt en ben veel te klein blijven lopen ik ben nog blijven knokken maar het was nog moeilijk goed te maken ik heb de wedstrijden van jonathan en kevin niet bekeken want zoiets geeft goed of slecht altijd emoties en ik wil vooral mijn eigen ding kunnen doen ik had natuurlijk liever zelf als eerste belg onder de 45 seconden gelopen maar ik gun het kevin van harte

5743714 dit is super voor hen allebei als 20 jarigen tonen ze hier nogmaals wat een enorme toekomst ze voor zich hebben en dit is natuurlijk ook heel positief voor de 4x400 m maar de ambitie blijft dezelfde eerst proberen de finale te halen en dan zo hoog mogelijk eindigen je mag niet vergeten dat je tegenover landen als de verenigde staten de bahamas en australi staat dat kevin met zes honderdsten de finale mist is jammer maar het doel voor hen was hier niet de finale al hadden we toch een klein beetje hoop hun doel was om de halve finales te lopen om te leren

5743738 chile brazil and mexico are among the countries which could be visited by united states presidential candidate barack obama before the november election following on recommendations for a latinamerican tour from his political advisors the purpose of the visit would be to deliver strong messages of rapprochement to the region basically to the largest economies brazil and mexico and to chile as the outstanding model of economic and social development besides it would look to counteract the republican candidate john mccain visit to colombia the news was born last week when chilean ambassador mariano fernandez in washington was invited to the lower house foreign affairs committee where apparently the initiative was confirmed by several democrat members of congress apparently the obama team also consulted with senator chris dodd and new mexico governor bill richardson who are considered experts in the area about which countries to visit and that was when the three names were mentioned furthermore state department sources confirmed that the obama team was working on the tour and informal contacts with the chilean embassy in washington had already been established

5743750 there are a few scenes where i have to drive a scooter with steve on my back
5743751 and i think the most perilous scenes for steve was when i was driving that scooter because im apparently awful in rehearsal i almost killed several people and on the day after we shot it steve made me promise id never do it again which i havent
5743752 i just thought dont worry about keeping up with him youre certainly not going to be able to surpass him in terms of improv just stay out of his way
5743753 apparently that was the thing that set me apart from the other actresses at the audition and why i got the part
5743754 i guess the most overt reference i made to barbara feldman was that in one scene i wear a wig that is reminiscent of her original haircut
5743755 i was also grateful to inherit her chanel bag addiction laughs that wasnt too painful
5743756 barack obama has generated so much excitement that some progressives i talk to simply think there is no way he could lose and its not really hard to see why obama is a terrific candidate and republicans have definitely made a mess of things but the truth is obama also faces some real hurdles between now and november

5743758 barry was a devoted husband and father he has died doing a job he loved
5743759 his family and the army was his life he will be forever missed by his wife children and family he will never be forgotten he died a hero
5743760 always calm and professional he was naturally suited to a medical career and planned to continue progressing in this area barry was a stalwart of the medical centre a hard worker he always volunteered for any task and was always at the centre of the team motivating and encouraging the younger medics
5743761 a thorough professional and a loving family man we have lost a great friend and fellow soldier while we mourn the loss of a regimental comrade all our hearts go out to shelly and the rest of barrys family for it is they who have borne the real burden of his absence and they who have now sustained the real loss they are ever in our thoughts and prayers
5743762 one study of 33 laparoscopic surgeons found that those who played video games were 27 percent faster at advanced surgical procedures and made 37 percent fewer errors than those who didnt advanced video game skills also were a good way to predict suturing abilities according to their study which was published in the archives of surgery in 2007
5743763 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed so the first question you might ask your surgeon is how many of these surgeries have you done and the second question is are you a gamer
5743764 researchers who gathered in boston for the american psychological association convention detailed a series of studies suggesting video games can be powerful learning tools from increasing younger students problem solving potential to improving the suturing skills of laparoscopic surgeons
5743765 other studies confirmed earlier research that found students who played violent games tended to be more hostile less forgiving and believed violence to be normal compared to those who played nonviolent games and those who played more entertainment games did poorer in school and were are greater risk of obesity

5743767 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5743768 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of get rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5743769 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really upset you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think that its all part of the healing
5743770 im going to have the best boobs in the nursing home
5743771 shes been sort of this quiet warrior in the back and has been a great support and just telling me that i was going to be ok and i knew i was going to be ok ive watched her
5743772 if this had been caught a year from now or when i was 40 i probably wouldnt be able to live through this
5743773 so for me one of the things that when this is all happened was that im putting together a program thats going to raise money to pay for mris for women who are at high risk
5743774 were also going to pay for the brca testing because thats very very expensive
5743775 you know i really love living and i really love my life i knew from this moment on it was only going to be good and that was going to be coming

5744032 there is no room in the priesthood for those that would abuse children
5744033 this people honors me with their lips but their heart is far from me in vain do they worship me teaching as doctrines the precepts of men
5744034 woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you traverse sea and land to make a single proselyte and when he becomes a proselyte you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves
5744035 the days of the pass or station house adjustment for father or brother by the irish cop or prosecutor are over either we will learn to become more comfortable in the gaze of the depending on our attitude or we will be dragged into a new future for religion and religious life
5744036 in order to justify their behavior they turn their theories into dogmas their bylaws into first principles their political bosses into gods and all those who disagree with them into incarnate devils this idolatrous transformation of the relative into the absolute and the all too human into the divine makes it possible for them to indulge their ugliest passions with a clear conscience and in the certainty that they are working for the highest good and when the current beliefs come in their turn to look silly a new set will be invented so that the immemorial madness may continue to wear its customary mask of legality idealism and true religion

5744050 ma nel documento finale non ci sono n i giudizi n le condanne che lui ha espresso
5744051 litalia la germania e la francia hanno molto contribuito al contenuto del documento finale ha sostenuto il ministro credo per che anche gli usa saranno solidali con queste decisioni non credo che giochino ora un ruolo divisivo dopo averne giocato oggi uno unitario
5744052 nessuno lo ha chiesto esplicitamente anche se usa e in particolare la gran bretegna hanno posto una domanda in questo senso ma era una domanda aperta retorica sulla utilit del consiglio
5744053 oggi abbiamo ribadito la necessit del rispetto degli impegni ha spiegato frattini dellaiuto alla popolazione della contuazione del dialogo tra nato e russia se mosca mostrer buona volont dare giudizi e valutare le colpe ci avrebbe portati su una china improduttiva

5744058 la sensazione di un ritorno a casa dice il ct tanto entusiasmo e solito spirito ma laustria non va sottovalutata
5744059 dopo cinque minuti sembrava di non essere mai andato via dice lippi ho la sensazione di essere tornato a casa ho visto una squadra con un grande entusiasmo tanti giocatori hanno gi lavorato molto con le loro squadre tutti stanno abbastanza bene si sono allenati sempre col solito spirito che conoscevo e con grande intensit sono molto soddisfatto
5744060 potremmo giocare cos dice il ct e una soluzione che mi affascina a patto che gli attaccanti curino anche la parte difensiva mi dispiace per il problema di camoranesi ma trattandosi di unamichevole non voglio rischiarlo fosse stata unaltra partita avrei insistito per cercare di recuperarlo ma non posso mettere a rischio la salute dei giocatori
5744061 se verr ci far piacere dice il ct azzurro ma potrebbe anche tornare alla juve per curarsi
5744062 its purely a byproduct of gameplay and this notion of a highly destructible environment
5744063 sticking to our ethos of do no harm to the game we tagged the parts in the environment for ads and like everything else in the game they can be destroyed its mirroring what the studio wants out of gameplay and making the most of it

5744069 when we evaluated virtualization options we felt that vmware offered the most robust and comprehensive platform

5744071 anyone who tries anything like that will face a crushing response
5744072 so far we have not seen any significant movement out of georgia
5744073 a new line in europe where russia somehow asserts that there are those who cannot opt for a trans atlantic future is unacceptable
5744074 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5744075 the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honor the words of president medvedev to abide by the six point peace plan which is not happening at the moment

5744083 mccain avait pr dit que nous serions accueillis comme des lib rateurs et que les irakiens supporteraient seuls le co t de la reconstruction
5744084 finir la guerre en irak nous permettrait dinvestir davantage aux etats unis de renforcer nos forces militaires et de finir le combat contre al qa da et les talibans en afghanistan et dans la r gion frontali re du pakistan

5744180 the mdgs should rightly have a sanitation goal but also mention safe disposal of water for productive and environmentally friendly reuse where feasible
5744181 for example wastewater irrigation should only be used for forest grasslands and non food crops also wastewater irrigation should not be used near potable or clean water sources to avoid pollution
5744182 with these policies the health and environmental impacts of it can be greatly reduced even if there is insufficient infrastructure to treat wastewater

5744211 chinese taipei was what we expected and i was just very impressed with them
5744212 i think it is something that i have been through having played in asia they really do a good job of making adjustments their scouting is second to none and they really pay attention to what is going on the first time through the order i was able to make some good pitches and get some swings and misses but they made the adjustment they started taking some good pitches and taking some good swings on others i was impressed but i also wasnt surprised
5744213 you never know what you are going to get everyone is playing hard and obviously we are in a tough situation in the fact that everyone is gunning for us and giving us their best it makes us have to be that much better
5744214 today was a must win we had to win today
5744215 we didnt want to back in to the medal round it was a tough ballgame taipei threw a pitcher that gave us a lot of trouble thanks to the bottom of my lineup and good pitching by brandon knight we managed to pull out a win so now the fun starts

5744226 san onofre is one of the safest places in southern california to work
5744227 but we dont think thats good enough because some other nuclear plants are even safer than ours so this is a focus of attention and we are catching up
5744228 you might see us escalate our engagement with the licensee
5744229 that screams to me that the oversight people arent doing their job and that the utility is not doing its job
5744230 no matter how good you are you can always improve
5744231 are there areas we can improve in at san onofre clearly but thats true for every single nuclear power plant in the country today
5744232 brazil are strong opponents and the reason why we won today is because we played to our own style and to our strengths
5744233 we knew brazil would be strong and that is why we played a patient game
5744234 in a game between brazil and argentina the side that leads will have a huge advantage
5744235 i think argentina played very well in this match and were very tough
5744236 brazil lacked a cutting edge in attack in the second half thats why things got a bit rough at times but i wasnt worried as thats football
5744237 seeing what we achieved in atlanta in 1996 everyone was waiting for us to do just the same
5744238 there is no doubt that nigeria is a tough team but we must just enjoy today and now rest
5744239 i think this argentina team tries to go for victory in every game and wants the gold medal so that is what they will try and do against nigeria
5744240 i said before the game that i was very optimistic based on the 18 players i have and i was not wrong today they thrashed brazil
5744241 we are not yet thinking about nigeria that will be from tomorrow wednesday onwards now we are very happy about having beaten brazil but surely if nigeria reached the final it is because they are a great team

5744256 we will do our best to make sure that every parent in california including tens of thousands of our supporters knows that a small group of california assembly members took a dive yesterday for the chemical industry
5744257 these assembly members skipped votes that would have protected infants and children from toxic industrial chemicals that are so pervasive they contaminate babies in the womb
5744258 wal mart and burger king do a better job protecting californians from these chemicals that the california legislature
5744259 recently approved pesticides have been implicated in massive bee die offs and are the focus of increasing scientific scrutiny
5744260 epa should be evaluating the risks to bees before approving new pesticides but now refuses to tell the public what it knows pesticide restrictions might be at the heart of the solution to this growing crisis so why hide the information they should be using to make those decisions
5744261 epa needs to help shed some light so that researchers can get to work on this problem this isnt just an issue for farmers this is an issue that concerns us all just try to imagine a pizza without the contribution of bees no tomatoes no cheese no peppers if you eat apples cucumbers broccoli onions squash carrots avocados or cherries you need to be concerned
5744262 i do believe that the best solution for kirkuk is that it be run as a separate region after resolving all pending issues between its segments conducting a census and then letting its population determine its fate through a referendum instead of one party imposing a solution
5744263 kurds must deal with kirkuk as an iraqi city not as a kurdish one because we will never abandon the houses in which we have lived for decades
5744264 our houses and land are our honour and we will never turn our backs on them
5744265 it kirkuk has always been kurdish and it must stay as it is
5744266 arabs and turkomans must acknowledge this fact then they will be welcome among us as are others who live in kurdistan

5744280 seek to insure burmese companies or operations of companies in burma
5744281 bars its member companies from maintaining an office in burma from directly writing insurance in burma or providing insurance into burma from outside the country
5744282 insurance companies are facilitating trade and investment in burma filling the pockets of the generals and helping keep them in power we welcome the news that xl and chubb have pulled out and will no longer help to fund the regime but we strongly condemn all insurers that remain involved in our military junta run country they help keep the generals in power and condemn burmas 50 million people to lives of poverty and fear there is no excuse for the likes of lloyds of london being involved they are helping to fund a brutal dictatorship
5744283 our members wont serve in the class much less outside it
5744284 the regime should focus on achieving national reconciliation establishing foundations for democracy which is the true aspiration of the people of burma and holding a genuine inclusive national convention in which all stakeholders can participate
5744285 if the spdc proceeds unilaterally as it is doing now we asked asean countries particularly indonesia to do their best to help sway spdc away from this course of action
5744286 the mpu delegation was invited and given special treatment as official guests they also made the arrangements for us to attend the special plenary session in parliament and to meet with the speaker of the house
5744287 this shows that they have high regard for the elected representatives of the people of burma and deep sympathy for the suffering and struggle of our people
5744288 they told us that asean was not without problems but that they were willing to get more involved and deal with burma issues tactfully
5744289 another point i raised is that a tripartite dialogue between the military ethnic leaders and the nld was imperative if national reconciliation is to be achieved in our country
5744290 for that to happen i said appeasement policy and a pacified approach would not work and that strong pressure was needed
5744291 the spdcs roadmap and its constitution need to be rejected and i suggested that the philippine president and government take the lead within the asean to initiate the move
5744292 under the present conditions i said the spdc does not represent our country and therefore world countries should stop giving it de facto recognition
5744293 after my report the chairperson of the foreign affairs committee said they were 100 percent behind the people of burma and that they would use whatever pressure they could to bring the spdc to the negotiating table
5744294 the key resolutions passed are to recognise the results of the 1990 elections to work for the emergence of a tripartite dialogue and for the philippine and other asean governments to censure spdc for its human rights violations and suppression of democratic forces in burma

5744297 bars its member companies from maintaining an office in burma from directly writing insurance in burma or providing insurance into burma from outside the country
5744298 seeks to insure burmese companies or operations of companies in burma
5744299 unless there are relevant or appropriate sanctions in place we cannot tell these companies where they can or cannot trade as far as we are aware there are no uk european union or united nations sanctions in place
5744300 we welcome the news that xl and chubb have pulled out and will no longer help to fund the regime but we strongly condemn all insurers that remain involved in our military junta run country

5744306 switzerland obviously doesnt have as large a pool of players as the bigger nations so we have to start well and hope the players stay in good form and play regularly for their clubs
5744307 i know how to deal with high expectations but i also know you can only hope to meet such expecations through a lot of hard work
5744308 i dont think many of our world cup qualifying opponents can say they have been to three straight major tournaments which shows that the work of koebi kuhn should not be taken for granted
5744309 wednesday will be a chance though for the players to show which of them can make the decisive steps ahead of our first qualifying match in israel and which other players offer us good alternatives

5744317 its hard to believe the israeli tank crew didnt see the pickup contained only journalists
5744318 a culture of impunity within the israeli forces which is contributing to routine use of reckless and disproportionate force
5744319 the decision of the tank crew and the officers who authorized the shot was reasonable since the suspicious figures and suspected missile presented a clear and present danger to the lives of the idf soldiers

5744353 so i think if youre just talking about income how about five million

5744371 another shameful page in the history of this nations treatment of its troops and veterans
5744372 they have given their all for us now how do we want to treat them who cares lets just get the next sucker to fill their slot
5744373 its a dream come true that was my big goal to make the final and hopefully crack top 12 and get a little more experience and just belong with these girls i believe i belong now

5744375 making it to top 12 oh my goodness my goal this year was to make it here so this is amazing to make it to the final
5744376 i was comfortable with 6 61 metres i thought that would get me through
5744377 its super exciting you walk into the stadium and its hard not to be in awe of almost every seat being sat in

5744380 freds leadership abilities enthusiasm for the sport of running and love of the community enabled him to successfully organize many local races and become president of the pictou county road runners club his success and enthusiasm in the sport of running will be admired for many years to come
5744381 one of the greatest honours anyone could do for fred it wasnt about winning with fred he wanted to run the race and fight the fight whether it was his running or his cancer
5744382 having been through this eight years ago and to be able to fight my way back onto the podium that was hard that was so hard
5744383 i wanted to discourage him and put it out there that if youre going to beat me youre going to hurt way more
5744384 jan just went and the way he went he was just going anyway he would have done it with 20 metres to go or from there so i made him make a decision early
5744385 i could see him on my inside there and i gave it one more crack just to see if i could break him but then you just start tying up and that hurt a lot
5744386 canadians want medals and i got called arrogant and i got called cocky and i thought wait a minute
5744387 theres a tragically hip song courage and we had the courage to put it out there that this is what we wanted to do and triathlon canada had the courage to support that
5744388 it just shows teamwork works and everyone who says it doesnt theyre just in denial

5744396 quarterly unit sales of handsets fell to their lowest level since npd begin tracking the category in 2005

5744398 obama showed the hes a closet muslim crowd that if he is he sure knows his christian catechism too
5744399 he invoked the book of matthew and seemingly easy familiarity with expressions like walking humbly with our god
5744400 when asked when he believes life begins he obama led with a wonderfully disarming comment about the answer to that question being
5744401 but he then proceeded to offer a somewhat rambling discursive response that i cant readily summarize after having just read the transcript three times
5744402 faith based organizations should not be advantaged or disadvantaged when it comes to getting federal funds
5744403 because people are careful about how they use the funds
5744404 it would mean a severe crippling of faith based organizations and their abilities to do the things that they have done so successfully

5744427 the survey paints a stark picture of the challenging business environment that has emerged in the uk over the past year with the economy facing its most difficult period since the early 1990s this is now compounded by high and uncertain oil and commodity prices creating inflationary pressures and fall out from the uk housing market downturn which has continued to gather pace at the same time we are seeing a new realism among businesses about the need to weather the current economic conditions with projected staff and capital investment both significantly down on this time last year
5744428 as an increased number of businesses express concern over late payment effective cash flow management is now more essential than ever for those sectors with rising input costs such as manufacturing and transport amp storage
5744429 we expect the slowdown to be at its worst towards the end of 2008 and into early 2009 we also expect inflation to start falling back from early 2009 allowing the bank of england room to cut interest rates throughout 2009 nevertheless overall the performance of uk plc through 2009 is likely to be the weakest growth since 1992 when the economy grew by just 0 3 per cent however towards the end of 2009 providing wage inflation stays low economic activity looks likely to pick up

5744435 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5744436 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5744437 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane

5744442 i like to hit but i think since ive been here the more i hit the worse ive been getting
5744443 i guess theyre going to hitch their wagon to him and just ride him off into the sunset
5744444 i was just looking for something out over the plate trying to put a good swing on it put it in play
5744445 he threw me a curveball and i was able to flip it to left
5744446 ive got to tip my cap because it was a slider down and away it looked at the video 100 times and ill probably see it 100 times when im not sleeping tonight he really helped himself out there its frustrating when something like that happens
5744447 it was a little awkward but i was just trying to get in scoring position
5744448 i always knew he was a good athlete but most pitchers lets be honest cant hit
5744449 he can swing the bat a little bit i just wish i could have hit some home runs in front of him instead of making him run like that
5744450 we just cant let them get away with us right there
5744451 and they got away the five runs is really unacceptable we cant let that happen there
5744452 hes definitely confident in his hitting abilities and for the right reason hes a good hitter
5744453 im just glad theyre willing to let the past be the past and give him a chance i just hope that the cincinnati fans will give him the same type of chance
5744454 i just have to be smart and handle myself like a professional at all times
5744455 i dont think it would be productive for our football team
5744456 theres responsibilities to being an nfl player its a privilege its not a right
5744457 just prior to the attack on moore bertuzzi had been on a shift to kill a penalty had missed the shift change and had remained on the ice for longer than the rest of his line
5744458 after being directed to get off the ice bertuzzi was on his way back to the bench when suddenly and without warning he turned around and skated back in the direction of moore and attacked moore
5744459 this was not done under any specific or general direction or encouragement from crawford was a direct disobedience of the instruction that bertuzzi had been given from the bench to get off the ice and was a violation of bertuzzis duties which crawford could not be expected to have reasonably anticipated let alone control
5744460 thats a mental mistake he made right there its not a lack of effort
5744461 its one of those situations where he assumed weve talked about assumptions thats an assumption on his part thats part of his game weve got to get rid of
5744462 i think everybody in here will do everything possible to make sure it doesnt happen again its not in joes hands any more its in nobodys hands but ours
5744463 it bothers me you get choked up a little bit because its like man weve got something real special here we dont need to be talking about this stuff
5744464 whats hurt us here is whats happened in the batters box we just havent swung the bats well in whats invariably a hitters park
5744465 hes going to be in my mind one of the best players to play the game you dont want anybody looking at you like you really dont want it
5744466 all applicants were judged based on academics community involvement financial need as well as a written commentary on their italian american heritage and culture

5744468 turkey with its rich culture great beach resorts and reputation as a value for money destination is bound to be a winner
5744469 fuel raises the bar in terms of scale and exhilaration for racing games we begin with the largest racing environment to appear in gaming ever with our accelerated effects of climate change and dynamic weather system we add an extra dimension that change races on the fly and constantly presents new challenges to players
5744470 player choice lies at the heart of fuels action packed races and with a huge range of vehicles packs of up to 16 vehicles speeding across diverse terrain and a no boundaries no limits approach to racing means players have never had so much freedom to conquer the wilderness and take the chequered flag
5744471 the technology asobo studios has developed to build fuel is ground breaking to create a game on this unprecedented scale to this level of graphical quality complete with all the dynamic weather effects is a great achievement
5744472 fuel had to be a special title for codemasters to include in our racing portfolio and we believe that from both a gameplay and a technical perspective fuel compliments our long standing tradition of driving excellence
5744473 he never really drew blood so when he used his closing statement to continue his attacks i was able to ignore them adopting a conventionally senatorial tone wax on about the privilege of service

5744483 overall how would you describe your confidence in the economic prospects facing your business over the next 12 months compared to the previous 12 months
5744484 tengo muchas paranoias con la sincronizada sue o de todo
5744485 the american audience is tuning in in droves on nbc and over half of the uk population watched the opening ceremonies
5744486 and we think a lot of that has to do with the pollution and peoples interest in how that would effect the games
5744487 i got the phone call late friday night that they were interested in moving the games here and i said to the guy i think you got the wrong number
5744488 but they really wanted to have the summer olympics here not sure where the hell were going to put everything though
5744489 janise i dont care what you do before you marry anybody you get your education and get your own money
5744490 im tired of screaming independent i wanna start depending on you cuz tonight i wanna feel like a woman
5744491 the vehicle failed shortly after liftoff and in no way reached its intended position
5744492 the failed launch shows that the purported iranian space program is in its nascent stages at best they have a long way to go
5744493 there was little food left in our house it is good they have called off protests for sometime
5744494 persistent shelling in this area where two weeks ago a large number of internally displaced people sought refuge forced them to move again further inside kilinochchi
5744495 such multiple displacements are also adding to the delays in providing adequate shelter
5744496 many of the internally displaced people who are yet to receive temporary shelter and are thus still living under trees are struggling to seek shelter from the rain
5744497 sri lanka is a unique case of a government maintaining its offices and funding the administration in territories unlawfully occupied by a terrorist group
5744498 plans are under way to settle them in shelters located in safe areas prior to the commencement of the new school term there is absolutely no truth in the reports of internally displaced people living under trees
5744499 terrorists are now fleeing the areas in numbers following extensive military ground and air assaults
5744500 but rather of possessing articles intending they should be used in some way at some future time of preparing and instigating acts of terrorism the precise details of which such as time and place had yet to be finalized
5744501 is amongst the largest and most extensive ever discovered and thus makes this case one of the most serious of its type to come before the courts
5744502 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5744503 people were pushed out of their homes literally with the clothes on their back
5744504 there is no one situation that applies to every one of the locales
5744505 our goal in this operation is to save lives and to alleviate the suffering of the georgian people
5744506 we will continue on this mission until the government of georgia and the department of state determines there is no longer a need
5744507 i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me
5744508 there can be no business as usual under present circumstances
5744509 the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honor the words of president dimitry medvedev to abide by the six point peace plan which is not happening at the moment
5744510 a new line in europe where russia somehow asserts that there are those who cannot opt for a trans atlantic future is unacceptable
5744511 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5744512 we are very disappointed because despite the promise to us there is no withdrawal of troops
5744513 when you sign up to an agreement you have to respect it
5744514 we dont want to use this sort of pressure but we also dont want this document the peace deal to remain a dead letter
5744515 were an empire now and when we act we create our own reality
5744516 you can reduce your fuel costs by more than 15 and i am talking about simple things like proper tire pressure avoiding rapid starts and stops and keeping your engine tuned
5744517 they killed innocent defenceless civilians people are traumatised we need food medicines we want the soldiers here
5744518 i compare this the talks to a shattered glass it would be very difficult to put the pieces together
5744519 were not going to walk away just because there have been a few bad days
5744520 we have already freed the towns we are on pursuit operations we will not stop until we catch up with them
5744521 concerns have been expressed that the humanitarian situation seems to be deteriorating
5744522 will defend them at all costs against any move by any group that will disrupt our aspirations for a genuine and lasting peace
5744523 this is a consequence of the non movement of the peace process
5744524 when ms huffington the 57 year old author and former conservative pundit announced her plans for the huffington post three years ago many critics dismissed the idea as a digital dinner party for her new liberal friends but it has grown in ways that few except perhaps ms huffington herself expected
5744525 and their right hand is a right hand of iniquity
5744526 ive been hearing from lots of families that are asking how can i find a loan because theyve been applying to three lenders and theyve been rejected from all three
5744527 many of the lenders that students may have used last year are no longer in the business
5744528 and your lender may be leaving and give you no notice
5744529 theyre tightening the criteria to get the very best rates and then theyre punishing you even more so when you cant get those
5744530 they want a very good credit history so if you dont have that your best option is to anyone who can cosign for you so you can get a better rate
5744531 its a very high energy up beat experience unlike any bank branch anyone has ever been in

5744541 but that wont be necessary im gonna win the money
5744542 communism looked a little more appealing after the depression when a lot of people were not benefiting from capitalism when there was anti there was a perception certainly not a reality that there was a lot less of it in the soviet union
5744543 at some point she realized this was her greatest role whatever loyalty she had to communism and towards the soviet union she could perform a lot more as a martyr than she ever could as a spy
5744544 he may be a scoundrel a hypocrite and a liar and may have violated the 2nd and 7th commandments
5744545 but that doesnt override the value of grand jury secrecy

5744549 it is hoped that niue as host will take the lead in navigating change to combat the overwhelming effects of climate change and to encourage the pif to raise its stance on the issues of climate change and not just paying lip service but be active and promoting all means of renewable energy recycling re use and so forth

5744577 unmark as dynamic data wizard preview 0806 for vs 2008 sp1 rtm is now available
5744578 when we evaluated virtualization options we felt that vmware offered the most robust and comprehensive platform

5744580 i am not worried you have to give them time he is 19 years old
5744581 theo is not yet completely there collectively but he can make decisions in big games that will always be his strength
5744582 he is a boy who will always make progress because he is intelligent and he knows where he wants to get and that is why i believe you have to patient with him
5744583 i believe that when everyone is sharp we will have much more invention
5744584 but of course you always want a player like fabregas to be in there because he gives you the quality of the pass
5744585 not only do we make results but we develop players as well
5744586 at the start of the season its always very difficult to assess how good players like denilson and johan djourou will be they can only develop if they play
5744587 its a tricky situation people want to see big names and they want to see good young players as well
5744588 i believe that when everyone is sharp we will have much more invention but you always want a player like fabregas to be in there because he gives you the quality of the pass
5744589 i immediately saw the england club doctor and after he had examined my ankle we both agreed that it would be too risky to play against slovenia
5744590 i left the england camp at 9am yesterday morning and was driven straight to the
5744591 i had a scan on my ankle and there is nothing broken or anything like that
5744592 i should be back in training in the next couple of days and i will be ready for saturdays match with
5744593 i hope we are not creating a situation where cars are backed up on seneca street especially with the window being as busy as we all think it will be
5744594 i could see a real problem on hockey nights or football nights
5744595 dinner with yoshiko and potential boyfriend candidates what am i going to wear
5744596 i tried to make the first move on a guy the other night and he totally didnt like it almost like he was offended or something
5744597 what like it was rude of you to make the first move
5744598 yes i mean who said the guy always has to make the first move and i was also older than him
5744599 another friend of mine was just telling me the other day that this younger guy she was dating would never make the first move
5744600 yeah and she was getting frustrated that she always had to be the one to start things so she thinks most young guys want to be lead when they date older women
5744601 the way he reacted made me feel like i should be ashamed of myself or something
5744602 we are proud to introduce 2k games showcase title bioshock to an entirely new audience
5744603 with the addition of the new add on game content we are able to extend the award winning adventure while maintaining the perfect harmony that millions of players around the world have fallen in love with
5744604 i know why labour is using it ive seen the focus groups too people like the word fair
5744605 they think government is unfair to those who work hard and play by the rules they want a fair deal and fair play
5744606 and when youre in trouble as a political party there is a temptation to cling desperately to the words that focus groups throw up
5744607 i remember an attempted conservative relaunch in 2003 was based on the theme a fair deal for everyone it was not a great success indeed we lost our party leader that autumn
5744608 we are currently on course to leave that next generation a higher national debt and the highest budget deficit of any major economy in the world
5744609 and far from changing course all the leaks and briefings coming out of the downing street at the moment suggest that the prime minister is preparing to try to buy his way out of trouble by bribing people with their own borrowed money
5744610 leaving our children to pay our debts is not fair we already know that we face a rising bill over the years to come from our ageing population
5744611 to add to the bill gross fiscal irresponsibility is not just economically reckless it is deeply unfair on future generations
5744612 we need to develop a new fiscal framework to replace the busted fiscal rules that were supposed to protect us from the short term spending sprees of politicians out to save their own skin a framework that fairly protects the interests of the next generation
5744613 we have discovered that state attempts to guarantee fairness through monopoly provision by monolithic public services turns out to be as unfair as previous ideas of 98 tax rates and forced equality of outcome
5744614 so if monopoly state provision is not the answer what is
5744615 evidence from around the world shows that just as a broad consensus now exists that we should be free to make our own choices and to innovate in the private sphere so we must trust choice competition in provision and local decision making in public services
5744616 the labour party is delighted that the battle is to be joined on fairness when we are fighting a tory party that for all the talk of change is still committed to the old unfair policies
5744617 this is the same tory party that opposed the minimum wage opposed pension credit and the winter fuel allowance opposed support for families through tax credits and still wont commit to any real pledge on child poverty and this is the same shadow chancellor whose flagship tax policy diverts 1bn to the 3 000 richest estates in the country
5744618 brian the phone is not to blame at least in my case when i put in a t mobile sim
5744619 how about the fact the macbook is thiner better screen size resolution much more powerful
5744620 is it ironic that the extension email was not pushed to my phone
5744621 lol when your korean chinese and japanese text goes to unicode i dont think it

5744627 thats their mission if theres an opportunity they must take advantage of it and its in the interests of their shareholders and they shouldnt be sentimental about it
5744628 so thats what capitalism is supposed to do take advantage of opportunities what im talking about and what i mean by disaster capitalism is a political strategy
5744629 venture capital firm edf ventures last week subpoenaed the web site thefunded demanding information about a person who left negative comments about edf this evening venturebeat has exclusively obtained documents requested by the subpoena thefundeds owner adeo ressi will likely hand over these documents to the court which actually issued the subpoena in ten days or so for now this post is the only place youll see the documents
5744630 despite the simple objective to make money in business it is very common amongst entrepreneurs and business owners to overlook their abilities to manage the business finances many business owners will engage a bookkeeper or an accountant to set up and manage the books others will buy financial accounting software programs and do their best to understand the power behind those types of software however a solid understanding of the business financial statements is critical for all business leaders regardless of how the reports are generated
5744631 the air force announced a surprising achievement last december the service now has the largest solar panel array in the americas more than 72 000 panels installed at nellis air force base in nevada produce 30 1 million kilowatt hours per year enough to power more than 13 000 homes during daytime
5744632 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
5744633 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
5744634 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
5744635 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
5744636 so of course i had to hop on over and see what was going on and sure enough saving with the modest momma is giving away 100 worth of coupons this friday which is her birthday
5744637 its the law of large numbers said brian weiser senior vice president at magna in this light the slowdown simply reflects the difficult nature of sustained high growth on an enlarged sales base
5744638 i cant really say theres anything beyond the maturity of the industry and the cyclical downturn
5744639 some advertisers are discovering the online world does not have the same standards and accountability as print and tv media
5744640 the slowdown in display advertising is due to much more than the macroeconomic issues of the economy advertisers are concerned more specifically that they are not always getting what they pay for with display ads
5744641 a big concern is over where ads appear advertisers buying across an ad network often dont know where ads will run
5744642 even on the large networks advertising may run on sites they dont want or in geographies theyre not interested in in the wild wild west of new media standards dont exist
5744643 advertisers spending money based on impressions want to make sure theyre not being billed for false impressions
5744644 but the most obtrusive techniques for gaining attention can often be the ones users find most annoying and obnoxious
5744645 google is known for innovation not only in the way they run their company but also in their applications and people seem to like some of the other services they have better than what yahoo and the others have
5744646 from a business perspective probably the most important metric you can have is whether you are satisfying your customers
5744647 because satisfied customers are going to be more loyal and recommend the service to other people
5744648 most of the services that google offers today they offered a year ago
5744649 because of the word of mouth factor there is a delay that happens between an innovation being launched and the average person understanding it
5744650 they did a repainting of their site where they really improved the look and feel and navigation but the underlying functionality didnt change
5744651 it was sort of a flash in the pan improvement
5744652 the chief concern right now is just making sure that everyone out there who is affected by this and who may know that this is happening also understands that there are a variety of things that they need to do to get their household ready
5744653 youll really have to be under a rock with no newspaper no television no anything not to know about it
5744654 a good third of the regional banks wont make it
5744655 esperamos que del bosque consiga lo logrado en el real madrid
5744656 la gente nos ha contado sus experiencias y la emoci n que ha sentido en cada momento
5744657 vivimos una etapa muy buena con luis aragon s con el que nos sentimos muy unidos todos hab is visto la conexi n que exist a entre seleccionador y jugadores y vamos a intentar hacer lo mismo con el nuevo seleccionador que a medida que pasen los partidos la conexi n sea igual o mejor porque espa a ser la beneficiada
5744658 hay diferencias entre los dos cada entrenador tiene su manera de ser y entrenar vicente es de una manera y luis de otra son dos t cnicos que han conseguido grandes xitos y esperemos que vicente emule lo que ha conseguido en el real madrid en la selecci n espa ola
5744659 la selecci n ha ofrecido un f tbol diferente este verano y agradecemos que le gente lo reconozca
5744660 todo lo que sea que suenen nombres espa oles bienvenido sea pero no conf o porque hay muchos grandes jugadores que se han quedado sin l
5744661 ser a un error centrarnos s lo en la d cima
5744662 en nuestro estadio ellos van a estar un poquito m s atr s y esperando esa contra que a ellos les gusta pero esperamos que en el bernabeu y con nuestra gente nos metamos en plena temporada
5744663 estamos en pretemporada y faltan muchas cosas pero en el partido de ida le hemos dado al equipo contrario lo que ellos quer an porque sus principales virtudes son el robo del bal n y la contra y nosotros hemos perdido muchas pelotas en zona peligrosa y ellos tienen gente de calidad
5744664 supongo que el entrenador y el apartado t cnico del club han analizado esta situaci n hace mucho tiempo por lo que va a ser la temporada y lo que nos va a exigir
5744665 son diez a os aqu pero lo que tengo claro es que esta temporada quiero que sea diferente a la anterior no por minutos jugados sino por mis sensaciones no estuve contento con mi a o pasado no me qued bien despu s de la lesi n y no estuve a la altura de lo que he dado siempre
5744666 ser a un error centrarnos s lo en la d cima al final lo que te juegas cada domingo es la liga
5744667 no lo veo tan mal y creo que se va a quedar con nosotros ya hab a dicho que tiene mucho m s para darle al madrid y es uno de los jugadores que marca la diferencia
5744668 es mentira el arreglo entre la uci y las grandes carreras
5744669 el que ha lanzado ese tema creo que ha mentido y no voy a ser yo el que va a destapar ese tarro que tiene mucha porquer a dentro que lo destape quien quiera
5744670 s puedo decir que pasado ma ana jueves va a haber una reuni n a la cual yo no voy a asistir ni tampoco mandaremos representante alguno ya que la misma ha sido organizada por algunos equipos a los que la uci ha enviado para adelante como avanzadilla
5744671 el que debe tener un arreglo con la uci es la familia francesa amory y la aso empresa organizadora del tour entre otras pruebas importantes y stos ya han dicho que no hay nada de ese arreglo por lo que esto es como el gato cuando est muri ndose que quiere ponerse con las u as para arriba y enganchar todo lo que pueda para salvarse
5744672 sta es la decisi n certada y la mejor para todos
5744673 parece que fue ayer cuando este equipo me dio la oportunidad de cumplir uno de los mayores sue os ser ciclista profesional han pasado once a os desde ese d a durante estos once a os el equipo ha ido creciendo paso a paso me siento muy privilegiado de haber podido aportar un peque o granito de arena para que este proyecto haya llegado a lo m s alto
5744674 palabras de agradecimiento para las personas a las que he conocido en todos estos a os
5744675 empezando por mis compa eros auxiliares sponsor afici n y sobre todo para miguel madariaga la persona que me dio la oportunidad de ser profesional les deseo la mejor de las suertes un equipo que recordar con especial cari o
5744676 ha llegado el momento de dejar paso a los j venes que vienen pisando fuerte
5744677 poder devolver la confianza que han depositado en m dando lo mejor que tenga en la carretera
5744678 no es hora de homenajes sino de afrontar una nueva etapa
5744679 el m ximo respeto a todo lo conseguido ya no es hora de homenajes y s de comenzar una nueva etapa
5744680 es normal que est un poco acelerado es un s ntoma de que se tiene emoci n por empezar y eso es importante en cualquier ejercicio de la vida
5744681 he vivido situaciones dif ciles y de gran responsabilidad y en una selecci n puede que se acreciente pero es parecido no hay mayor responsabilidad en un club que una selecci n
5744682 es lo mejor para m y para el f tbol espa ol partimos de una base y lo que hace falta es que sepamos cuidar todo lo que se ha conseguido y si es posible potenciarlo
5744683 mirar para atr s era una obligaci n m a en el plano humano y profesional
5744684 en el plano humano les hice ver la uni n y la humildad que hab an tenido en la eurocopa quer amos que eso siguiera porque el futbolista debe ser humilde y que el t tulo de la eurocopa no le cambie
5744685 en el plano futbol stico tambi n hay que mirar para atr s para atr s porque lo conseguido es importante el camino est marcado por eso en lo sustancial la convocatoria para este partido difiere muy poco de la que fue campe n de europa
5744686 es mi idea individualizar las charlas y ayer lo hice con los centrocampistas y les dije que tambi n son hombres b sicos para el futuro como lo han sido hasta ahora
5744687 me lo imagino como una vuelta a la normalidad y a la actividad y que el pasado no nos llegue a confundir
5744688 se puede ir cambiando luego en funci n del rival y de los partidos pero una idea base ya la tenemos
5744689 desde el m ximo reconocimiento a todo lo que se ha hecho en el pasado no estamos para homenajes sino para afrontar una nueva etapa y una nueva competici n estoy un poco alterado y es producto de la emoci n que me produce poder volver al trabajo porque no soy una persona muy fr a y s un apasionado al f tbol
5744690 hay que intentar que el equipo sea un bloque lo m s s lido posible
5744691 el comienzo esta ah a la vuelta de la esquina y a n nos queda un poco para estar a nuestro m ximo nivel
5744692 el equipo tiene que ser fuerte atr s es lo m s importante este a o y a partir de ah ser fuerte arriba
5744693 estoy intentando adaptarme lo mejor posible al lateral izquierdo cada d a voy un poquito mejor espero coger confianza e ir puliendo detalles eso te lo dan los partidos
5744694 siempre he dicho que quiero quedarme si el club no me quiere es otra cosa pero yo quer a cumplir mi a o de contrato y todav a quiero cumplirlo luego es el mister el que va a decidir lo que va a pasar
5744695 he hablado con el mister hemos aclarado algunas cosas pero eso se queda para nosotros desde que he llegado aqu esta temporada trabajo he realizado mi trabajo lo mejor posible y luego veremos lo que pasa
5744696 ahora es otro tema la liga va a empezar en 10 d as o algo as y lo importante son el trabajo que estamos haciendo y los partidos de preparaci n
5744697 lo que hemos hecho ahora es ultimar los ltimos detalles
5744698 es muy importante para l y adem s apunt que su fichaje llega en
5744699 con aspiraci n a ser campe n ol mpico y titular en su club
5744700 el jugador quiere dar el paso a un gran club de europa que es el sue o de todo futbolista extranjero

5744728 as we enter the second decade of funding under this historic legislation we face new threats from global warming drought and catastrophic wildland fires
5744729 but we are confident that our unique federal state partnership has the expertise public support and flexibility to effectively respond to these challenges
5744730 the department of the interior remains committed to working with federal state and local leaders private landowners and the public to improve landscapes restore wildlife habitat protect vital water resources and develop new recreational facilities in nevada and around magnificent lake tahoe

5744732 the hazardous fuels reduction projects at lake tahoe and the carson range will help reduce fuels from around houses and in forested areas near communities
5744733 i started getting suspicious when the british woman approached leone and started chatting with him

5744736 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
5744737 the group of us fought alongside some allies on the right to preserve our independence as a medium from federal regulators and campaign finance
5744738 political blogging is exactly the type of internet activity that the commission exempted from the definition of contribution and expenditure

5744743 as long as water is going to be an issue in the west there should be an open conversation among all parties
5744744 litigation pitting state against state over the colorado river would cost taxpayers millions and the likely result would not please anyone

5744754 the global digital media economy continues to expand quickly with an annual growth rate of 31 percent but we are now seeing a considerable slowdown in quarter on quarter growth across the board
5744755 it seems that not even an emerging sector such as digital media is immune to the global economic downturn
5744756 companies relying solely on digital revenues for growth may struggle in the second half of 2008 as consumers and advertisers alike tighten budgets
5744757 im a bad liberal and quite so impressive and no independence quite so important as living within your means

5744772 the cayennes interior is identical to the outgoing models which is somewhat of a disappointment

5744782 the 0 to 60 mph run takes 4 8 seconds
5744783 can hit 60 mph in 7 5 seconds starting from a stop
5744784 the six speed is notchy and rubbery with long throws and an indeterminate gate characteristics far from helpful in ensuring smooth progress
5744785 its a lifeless stick that feels even more out of place because the parking brake isnt on the center console
5744786 gas mileage is projected to be 8 to 15 percent better than before
5744787 the body roll typically found in heavy tall vehicles is gone
5744788 the adjustable air suspension is very flexible offering both a terrific supple well controlled ride in the comfort setting and a fair amount of precision in the sport setting
5744789 less corrupted than in other all wheel drive porsche cayennes off road capabilities and they claim that the
5744790 supportive seats covered with a handsome combination of leather and a suede like material called alcantara
5744791 with rear seats up the cayenne accommodates a substantial 19 cubic feet of cargo
5744792 excellent lateral support though seat bottoms may pinch some physiques
5744793 passengers need to twist ankles to clear door frames on exit
5744794 cargo capacity at 62 5 cubic feet is on the small side for a midsize luxury suv
5744795 with rear seats up the cayenne accommodates a substantial 19 cubic feet of cargo
5744796 decorates the steering wheel rim door handles grab handles and other areas where many luxury models use simulated coverings
5744797 fit and finish especially with the optional wood or metallic accent packages is excellent
5744798 even at those speeds the cabin is quiet enough to hear the gasps from the back seat
5744799 front and rear park assist are standard on the turbo
5744800 active antiroll bars are now available on air suspended models
5744801 available safety features include abs traction control an antiskid system with rollover sensors

5744803 guards against rollover and increases the effectiveness of the brakes on loose and slippery surfaces
5744804 a high seating position with a commanding view of the road
5744805 major upgrades inside the porsche cayenne are a power operated tailgate and the addition of a rear seat dvd entertainment system
5744806 mundane but still useful options are a trailer hitch and a cargo area management system
5744807 automatic climate control a 12 speaker cd audio system foglamps full power accessories
5744808 navigation system heated steering wheel leather upholster heated front and rear seats
5744809 the steering wheel stereo controls still seek up and down through radio stations rather than scrolling through presets
5744810 the heated steering wheel is connected directly to the heated seat control
5744811 doesnt let you crank the heat on the wheel when only your fingers are cold while keeping the seat temperature less toasty
5744812 these sound like minor quibbles but on a vehicle this expensive everything should be thoroughly thought out
5744813 many of the turbos features are available as options on the lesser trims
5744814 the going away view is arguably the sexiest perspective in the current porsche lineup
5744815 the cayman squats especially close to terra firma parked in the driveway
5744816 unmistakably a porsche displaying numerous classic styling cues not only from the 911 but from a host of the marques previous street and competition cars
5744817 has pronounced front fenders finished with elliptical headlights and a low hood
5744818 the cayman s appearance veers away from the boxsters the farther back you go
5744819 a key visual differentiator between the two models is that the cayman s wears 18 inch wheels fitted with lower profile tires than those that wrap the 17 inch rims on a base cayman
5744820 the top line variant also has a subtle black front spoiler lip
5744821 also available for the 2008 cayman s is the porsche design edition 1
5744822 has added design features such as black paint with matte black stripes 19 inch wheels a chrome plated sports tailpipe and a custom interior color scheme
5744823 easy to scan gauges with black faces on the base cayman and satin aluminum dials on the cayman s
5744824 puts the tachometer appropriately dead ahead on the instrument panel
5744825 the audio and climate systems are governed by too many undersized look alike buttons
5744826 the radio button layout isnt the best and the sun visors are tiny
5744827 stirring performance capabilities and the soul of road going porsches of days past
5744828 a 2 7 liter horizontally opposed flat six cylinder engine that generates 245 hp and 201 lb ft of torque
5744829 the cayman s is powered by a 3 4 liter flat 6 that puts out 295 hp and 251 lb ft of torque
5744830 comes standard with a five speed manual transmission with an optional six speed manual or a five speed automatic with steering wheel mounted shift buttons
5744831 a six speed manual transmission is standard and the automatic is again optional
5744832 gets respectable fuel mileage as much as 20 mpg city and 29 highway when equipped with a five speed manual
5744833 even among all the legendary porsche models its hard to recall a car that feels so utterly right under virtually all dynamic conditions
5744834 when the road goes squiggly there are few cars on this planet that can keep up
5744835 normal mode meets the demands of practical daily driving and handles bumps in the road without sacrificing performance while the sport mode takes thrill seeking weekend drives to a whole new level
5744836 once you climb into the two seater and semi fall into the drivers seat the cabin is accommodating
5744837 seating is comfortable and supportive and the cabin affords a surprising amount of headroom
5744838 may look a little meek compared to the highly bolstered ones in some sports cars but the side bolsters are plenty capable of holding you in place during aggressive driving
5744839 cargo bays front and rear for more luggage carrying possibilities than in many two seaters
5744840 stowage space under both the front hood and beneath the rear hatch
5744841 a good deal more practicality than may be apparent at first glance
5744842 hatchback body style offers more cargo capacity than the boxster with 9 1 cubic feet in the rear and a front trunk or frunk that brings total storage capacity to 14 5 cubic feet
5744843 for amenities some rivals include as standard including full leather upholstery
5744844 the engines location behind the seats means more mechanical ruckus than in front engine designs
5744845 minimal sound insulation to keep the din at a palatable level
5744846 available safety features include abs traction control antiskid system and side airbags
5744847 the intervention threshold of the stability control system is commendably high
5744848 antilock disc brakes stability control traction control and torso and head protecting side impact airbags
5744849 unlike most cars that have side curtain airbags mounted in the roof the cayman s curtain airbags are installed in the doors like the boxster roadster and inflate upward
5744850 the intervention threshold of the stability control system is commendably high
5744851 the prominent roof pillars can block sightlines to the sides or rear
5744852 visibility fore and aft is excellent but the view to the rear corners is compromised by excessively thick roof pillars
5744853 heated outside mirrors a cd player cruise control a trip computer and full power accessories
5744854 an auxiliary input jack for connecting a portable music player
5744855 the number of options is dizzying particularly in regards to customizing interior trim and styling selections
5744856 nifty upgrades start with the sport chrono package that can keep track of your lap times intensify throttle response and alter shift mapping of the tiptronic s transmission
5744857 bi xenon headlamps and four different kinds of 19 inch alloy wheels
5744858 optional automatic air conditioning system for instance has only one zone not two
5744859 you dont have to check many on a porsche order sheet to produce big price escalations
5744860 i think there are some in the girls bathroom i can get some for you
5744861 es ist derzeit aber noch zu fr h zu sagen wie es weitergeht
5744862 we have had complaints about connectivity in the netherlands but have not had more complaints than usual for a 3g phone in germany our technicians said today apple has issued a software update but it is too early to tell if the problems are solved

5744866 if anyone would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
5744867 a big white light came from the microwave into the kitchen
5744868 the 3 foot rule allows us to ride in the safest part of the road
5744869 often on the far right side there are lots of bumps nicks and other debris and now this law gives us that choice to ride in the safest spot
5744870 we just want to make drivers aware of these new laws it hasnt really been published in the drivers handbooks yet
5744871 we have received a check for 85 000 from an agreement we made with enbridge inc
5744872 part of our agreement with them is that there will not be any drilling through our roads and after this is completed the area will be put back into the same shape as when the company first started
5744873 plus there is a little jog toward the power plant of about maybe one and a half miles so youre talking about seven to eight miles through grand rapids
5744874 not all of the townships will have the same type of agreement because each one will have their own separate issues
5744875 because they are using the county system to move pipe our agreement is based on fees associated with the number of pipes at the yard the number of county highway crossings utility permits and administrative costs
5744876 most townships dont charge for moving permits but they could charge for mileage and road crossings for example the route through grand rapids is not a straight one but rutland is a longer route because the township is longer than it is wide
5744877 is already a lot of pipeline in the area this is just an expansion of our existing system that was built in 1950 and working since the 60s its the second stage of a two stage project
5744878 dwee da do waaay bee bu du bip bip du waaaayy

5744882 our investigation showed negligence on murrays part and thats why he was charged
5744883 these are the people that will be raising my child
5744884 its not a box problem its freeview they have changed the transmitter range thats the reason it cannot work
5744885 dmols plans were conveyed to freeview the manufacturers and retailers and we worked together to optimise the roll out plan
5744886 together with the manufacturers were doing all we can to help viewers find the best value replacement box
5744887 i can afford a replacement but there are an awful lot of people for whom the replacement box and installation is an awful lot of money

5744891 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5744892 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5744893 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5744894 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5744895 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5744896 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5744897 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5744898 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5744899 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5744900 the fuel cell vehicles in the caravan will drive roughly 20 000 combined miles and use domestically produced hydrogen to reach los angeles
5744901 together we can show the country and the world how individual state and local programs are making a national change
5744902 bringing these vehicles to market requires continued commitment from government and industry
5744903 building convenient accessible hydrogen stations is crucial in the next few years
5744904 there will be a dozen legislators house and senate members in pontiac to specifically hear what the effect of closing pontiac correctional center will be
5744905 it is imperative we have a good showing from the public we need your attendance
5744906 its a situation that if they close pontiac correctional center will force people to choose between moving their families to thomson or losing their jobs we dont want the state contributing to unemployment numbers
5744907 after pontiac streator has the second largest amount of employees at the prison
5744908 losing those jobs would have a negative impact on our area

5744919 i am so close to creating something unique already this model heals herself when she is sick can put up six unexpected guests for the weekend wave good bye to her husband from a pier a runway or a depot and understand why its important that he leave
5744920 but she had the strength of a lion you would not believe what she can endure
5744921 something is wrong with the construction im not surprised that it has cracked you are trying to put too much into this model
5744922 its for joy sadness pain disappointment loneliness pride and dedication to all the values that she and her husband hold dear

5744924 required a lot of compromise to be made on a number of sensitive issues
5744925 the agreement will make sadc an attractive area for doing business
5744926 the free trade plan was first considered eight years ago and required sadc member states to systematically cut tariffs on goods traded within the bloc
5744927 a great letterboxer is not judged on how many finds or plants he or she has the true test of greatness is based on how many friends the person has made during the hobby
5744928 when i think multiple medals i think about rower steve redgrave and swimmer michael phelps
5744929 although i havent quite matched up to their medals its a great achievement to have three gold medals around my neck
5744930 every time ive done a pb personal best in training chris tends to step up pretty much straight away and beat it
5744931 he drags everyone on hes the reason the team sprint goes well hes a real key member of the team
5744932 it hasnt sunk in yet this whole week has been unreal
5744933 chris hoy is a legend hes my hero and hes even more of a legend now
5744934 im lucky to be training with him hes a real inspiration
5744935 i keep pinching myself thinking im going to wake up its very emotional watcing the races in the olympic village its a dream come true
5744936 i just thank the uci for making his last event defunct
5744937 it has proven to be the an absolute rebirth of the guy all the years and the work of preparation for the kilo are paying off for him as a sprinter
5744938 i just try to keep up with bradley wiggins and all the rest youve got to win a gold medal to get a look in in the team nowadays
5744939 i think the biggest challenge to us is going to come from within the team
5744940 it was like racing a car at max velocity when you hit a curve you either maintain control or you crash and burn
5744941 today i crashed and burned im shocked and sad but im happy for the girls
5744942 the first thing i noticed was the really jerky scrolling in applications like looking at photos and e mail lists anything that had long lists didnt like to scroll but on the previous firmware it was very very fast
5744943 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
5744944 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
5744945 this is almost like a soap opera theres so much negative press and blogging this these firmware update issues are another problem apple doesnt need at amp t as a seller of this doesnt need from a pr standpoint
5744946 signore tu avevi detto che saresti stato con me in tutti i giorni della mia vita ed io ho accettato di vivere con te perch mi hai lasciato solo proprio nei momenti pi difficili

5744958 egs could be the killer app of the energy world it has the potential to deliver vast quantities of power 24 7 and be captured nearly anywhere on the planet and it would be a perfect complement to intermittent sources like solar and wind
5744959 innovation is the path to massive quantities of cleaner cheaper energy the people were funding today have a real shot at lowering the cost of egs and bringing us closer to our goal of renewable energy cheaper than coal
5744960 energy is a major concern in the everyday operation of businesses and organizations across america
5744961 this fund is an excellent opportunity for us to expand the mission of our community development efforts to bring affordable green energy solutions to facilities primarily in low and moderate income areas it also supports citis 2007 announcement of 50 billion in investment and financing over 10 years to address global climate change
5744962 with budget cuts rising energy and gasoline prices and economic pressures it is more crucial than ever for businesses schools and non profit organizations of all types to receive assistance now with this support from citi community capital we are able to offer much needed help to reduce and stabilize energy costs and reduce dependence on brown energy

5744968 when we evaluated virtualization options we felt that vmware offered the most robust and comprehensive platform

5744970 broadly surveys the political landscape in the light of past and present happenings

5744973 dial 911 and dont attempt to throw the phone at me or do anything bad or ill just shoot you
5744974 these people are only trying to make a better life for themselves
5744975 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5744976 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5744977 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction
5744978 as part of an ach recurring billing or check by phone payment system we wanted to provide our merchants a simple interface that will provide either a bank routing number when bank name is provided or vice versa
5744979 the workplace is becoming less a melting pot than a mosaic
5744980 latino culture teaches that building relationships is often critical to working together

5744983 jon voight your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away 3 million of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5744984 arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5744985 it might be good for your asian and african childrens self esteem to know you support a brown man for the leader of the free world
5744986 now go back to making your movies about women who love to handle big guns that shoot hundreds of people to death
5744987 he did what no man could he outran the devil

5744992 there is a great deal of movement toward downtown redevelopment throughout texas as the baby boomers begin retiring
5744993 theres a lot of nostalgia because they like to see the old structures renovated we are going full circle because we went to shopping centers and strip malls and are now moving back downtown
5744994 the hotels three lower floors will have places for restaurants and office and retail use
5744995 brint and kris have a big heart for big spring and want to make it economically viable
5744996 hopefully this will be the cornerstone for more development of historic downtown buildings
5744997 the site does not only provide breaking political news and press releases but it also serves as a vertical search engine for press releases from major u s departments websites
5744998 you stopped the car and picked a flower for me

5745000 we are working at the ultimate edge of what is possible

5745002 we are pleased to have ken take on the role of ceo ken has been instrumental in completing the restructuring of the companys financing arrangements
5745003 we are very pleased to have completed the restructuring of this bank credit facility with btmucc and are gratified by the ongoing support of our lender
5745004 let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering
5745005 let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds not forsaking our own assembling together encouraging one another
5745006 the growth of advances is far better than what it was last year we have seen credit offtake from july 2007 to june 2008 increasing by 26 per cent against 20 per cent year on year yoy in 2006 07
5745007 it will depend on the half yearly review by march next the further opening up will be based on the review findings
5745008 higher interest rates may somewhat slow down credit growth though it is too early to estimate by what percentage
5745009 im absolutely convinced that there is a moral and ethical element to this issue
5745010 limits on late term abortions if there is an exception for the mothers health
5745011 in 2007 obama told the planned parenthood action fund that the freedom of choice act would be the first piece of legislation that he would sign as president the act would not only codify roe v wade but wipe out all current federal state and local restrictions on abortion that pass muster under roe including the hyde amendment prohibiting federal funding of abortion
5745012 thats not the obama record on abortion i knew in chicago
5745013 in 2007 obama told the planned parenthood action fund that the freedom of choice act would be the first piece of legislation that he would sign as president the act would not only codify roe v wade but wipe out all current federal state and local restrictions on abortion that pass muster under roe including the hyde amendment prohibiting federal funding of abortion
5745014 berlin is avoiding any kind of confrontation because germany has no lever to exert pressure
5745015 with its attack on georgia russia has shown the west that it doesnt intend to change
5745016 russias own people is bombarded with propaganda just like stalins day but what is the reaction of the neighbors and of western europe so far it seems as if old europe is above all scared of the aggressor and still hopes for a savior to take power in the kremlin article
5745017 theres a general attraction to gold given the uncertainty with other financial instruments
5745018 real interest rates are negative and the fed is walking a fine line between growth and trying to restrain inflation
5745019 the intermediate and junior gold and silver producers will outperform the industry giants over the coming months and years
5745020 ive been hearing from lots of families that are asking how can i find a loan because theyve been applying to three lenders and theyve been rejected from all three
5745021 many of the lenders that students may have used last year are no longer in the business
5745022 and your lender may be leaving and give you no notice
5745023 theyre tightening the criteria to get the very best rates and then theyre punishing you even more so when you cant get those
5745024 they want a very good credit history so if you dont have that your best option is to anyone who can cosign for you so you can get a better rate
5745025 every year we get the appeal from some who says i just lost my job or my condo which i thought was valued at x is now valued at y or whatever it might be
5745026 are we hearing more of those i dont know yet but the voices certainly sound a little more desperate
5745027 a lot of these schools are scrambling to try to find a way to keep their student from dropping out because they cant pay the bills
5745028 people that do it on their own very rarely make those decisions at the right time
5745029 its so difficult to pull the trigger when the markets going up and when the markets going down you dont want to pull the trigger and then there you sit with your money still in stocks and tuition bills to pay
5745030 if i had to bet my life on it id bet it is joe
5745031 barack is moving toward a seasoned beltway type and that probably means biden
5745032 joe wont be afraid to get in mccains face which is what obama needs
5745033 the transition from mac to mobileme was rockier than we had hoped
5745034 while we are making a lot of improvements the mobileme service is still not up to our standards we are extending subscriptions 60 days free of charge to express appreciation for our members patience as we continue to improve the service

5745067 patrick got it right when he argued during the campaign that rather than debating whether we should raise or lower taxes we should first consider what we want to do and then discuss how to pay for it in that spirit those of us who were with him from the beginning are saying that it is time to talk
5745068 the report is in part reassuring people that it is worthwhile recycling plastics
5745069 the question that we were trying to answer is it better to send it to china rather than landfill it we are not saying or issuing guidance to people

5745083 he was a better golfer than i was i am not grateful for that but he seemed to genuinely like it if i hit a good shot which is a sign of grace

5745111 if citizens dont have accurate information about actual political conditions it is difficult to offer a meaningful or even critical opinion
5745112 anything that challenges the notion of building this great strong china

5745138 women working in the insurance industry can take small steps everyday to try and improve the overall industry performance which has been lackluster at best

5745180 coal burning leaves toxic heavy metal legacy in the arctic
5745181 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and 70s the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s

5745242 working in harmony with nature is becoming more and more important as increasing demands are made on our environment the uks native species need our support and i hope todays announcement will help give the pool frog a secure future
5745243 it is vitally important to have this kind of protection in place for the pool frog before we could consider reintroducing them to new ponds in other parts of east anglia
5745244 early signs are encouraging that the pool frogs are settling in to the current release site however it will be several years before we can confidently assess the success of this reintroduction
5745245 charter schools have a key role to play in our education system in new york and across the country
5745246 they deliver for our kids bringing high standards and strict accountability to every school day we see the results in their students outstanding academic performance and huge parent demand for seats in these schools
5745247 the results achieved in charter schools are proving that public school students regardless of their background can achieve excellence
5745248 last year charter school students in our city who are overwhelming black or hispanic and poor performed at the same level as students across new york state these schools are proof that if we work hard we can close the achievement gap that has existed for far too long between black and hispanic students and their white and asian peers
5745249 mayor bloomberg and chancellor klein understand what so many havent if you want to dramatically improve public education you not only have to reform from the inside by changing the district structure and district schools you also have to bring reform from the outside by creating new charter schools
5745250 the mayor and the chancellor are doing both and children in new york city public schools both district and charter are better served because of this
5745251 the bronx leads the city in the charter school movement so it is fitting that we announce the next generation of charter schools in the bronx today
5745252 charter schools have proven to be successful models for educating or children and sound investments in the future of our school system this is a great day for students and a great day for education in new york city
5745253 the aca has discussed the situation with its executive and our position is we cant recommend to our players they should tour pakistan for the champions trophy
5745254 we feel for the pakistan cricket board and the people of pakistan but it is the job of the aca to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour
5745255 unfortunately in this case we dont believe it is safe

5745262 the implication is that people at risk of macular degeneration could help prevent the disease by consuming antioxidants
5745263 this work by dr vollmer snarr and colleagues ties these two damaging processes together and demonstrates the harm they cause in combination is much more than would be expected
5745264 this new knowledge suggests the possibility of interventions which could prove to be powerful ways to prevent or delay age related macular degeneration

5745266 those elections and the merging of the douglas shire council with the cairns city council couldnt come soon enough
5745267 if it had been another 12 months until they were due then im quite sure that the state government would have dismissed the douglas shire council and appointed an administrator
5745268 the former douglas shire councils management practices were seriously sub standard it was not functioning as a responsible competent council should operate
5745269 it was weighed down by poor management practices across a range of areas douglas shire council ratepayers and customers were being poorly served
5745270 the state government has a responsibility to act when a local council is incapable of doing its job properly this was clearly the case with the former douglas shire council
5745271 mismanagement was rife and there was little or no prospect of the elected council turning the situation around
5745272 merger or no merger that council was living on borrowed time if it hadnt been merged with cairns city council or if it hadnt been voted out of office there was every likelihood it would have been dismissed
5745273 from information provided to me it is clear that the council was mired in its own inability to do the job it was elected to do
5745274 by way of example the situation regarding the councils management of water supplies was totally unacceptable and illustrates the former douglas shire councils inability to manage its affairs
5745275 it simply did not have a sufficient contingency margin in its water storage capacity and it was more a case of good luck than good management that there was not an incident such as a plant failure or a burst pipe that would have left port douglas and mossman without water
5745276 if there had have been a major fire for example in port douglas or mossman the situation could have been a complete disaster
5745277 the daintree river crossing toilet project can only be described as a fiasco the council simply should never have got itself into the mess that it did with this project
5745278 it wasted a large sum of money through failing to get the necessary approvals and plan and do the job properly
5745279 it was the same with expenditure by the former council on management consultants with very little to show for the substantial amounts of money spent
5745280 in both cases it was ratepayers who were shortchanged and left shouldering the cost burden of the councils mismanagement
5745281 the new council is spending 1 5 million increasing water storage capacity and on other measures to address the water supply issues
5745282 it is steadily overhauling the management practices that had been in place to ensure a higher standard of administration for the areas that were the responsibility of the former council
5745283 councillor leu was elected as a member of the newly merged council just five months ago and she should be directing her efforts to working closely and co operatively with her fellow councillors for the region as a whole and more specifically for the division she represents
5745284 i would hope that councillor leu understands that significant efforts are being made to address the range of problems that the former douglas shire council had either placed in the too hard basket or lacked the capacity to properly manage
5745285 i would hope that councillor leu is prepared to work to give the new arrangements and the new approach a fair go and is not swayed by populist pressures to support turning back the clock on amalgamation
5745286 this talk about de amalgamation on the grounds that the merger has been a failure and residents and ratepayers of the former douglas shire council are worse off is quite absurd
5745287 ghost towns old flour mills shearing sheds and even the humble vegetable garden can tell the stories that will enliven queenslands 150th birthday celebrations
5745288 the historians behind the queensland places project believe that old slide collections and photo albums will hold some of queenslands most telling images
5745289 family history that people cherish can tell an even bigger story that could be cherished by all queenslanders in the centuries to come
5745290 queensland is a young dynamic state that is now going through massive changes and this is a wonderful opportunity to record memories from the past
5745291 we need the help of the public to find illustrations of towns and workplaces over the past 60 years to complement the extensive photographic collections of the state library and the queensland state archives
5745292 the pictures will be scanned and immediately returned to their owners as long as the owners are happy for their pictures to be accessible on the website
5745293 we are particularly keen to hear from people who have coloured slides from the l950s to the l970s that include photographs which show both people and the landscape including images of changes in land use climate social and economic conditions
5745294 sometimes the most evocative image of a place might be of a backyard with a chook shed an outhouse or a large vegetable garden we need to know the location of the photograph who took it and when it was taken
5745295 other images might depict the ravages of a flood or cyclone or a mine closure or other industrial episode that reduced a bustling settlement to a ghost town
5745296 its clear from those early figures that more and more queenslanders are keen to do their bit for the environment
5745297 i recently inspected the first residential solar system installed on a home on magnetic island under the governments solar city initiative
5745298 its the first in a mass rollout of solar systems by ergon energy and its set to transform magnetic island into a truly solar suburb
5745299 were investing 15 million into this world class initiative the solar suburb will save energy and reduce dangerous greenhouse gas emissions by around 50 000 tonnes over the next seven years thats the same as taking 1700 cars off the road for the same period
5745300 magnetic island residents are to be congratulated theyre helping to create a blueprint for future sustainable energy use and the world will soon be watching
5745301 greenpeace wants to feature our solar city initiative there in a new documentary to bring more people around to the benefits of renewable energy
5745302 the town of windorah in remote south west queensland will be the first town in queensland to use solar power for all of its daytime electricity needs
5745303 this could revolutionise the way power is produced for remote communities that are not on the national electricity grid
5745304 the dishes will act as giant sunflowers facing and following the sun so they capture as much sunlight as possible
5745305 i am very confident about the preliminary work done to date and the final results of this pilot
5745306 queensland has looked overseas for innovations that will help us improve health care delivery in the face of a worldwide shortage of doctors
5745307 physicians assistants will extend the capacity of our highly skilled medical workforce they have already proven their worth in similar health systems in the united states canada england and scotland
5745308 the trial will ensure we find the best way for the physicians assistant role to fit with existing health care staff
5745309 there are 22 nurse practitioners already working for queensland health in areas such as townsville hospital redlands hospital redcliffe hospital the princess alexandra hospital and the gold coast hospital

5745348 i think that i worked out a couple things for myself kind of what i want to create in the world with being a celebrity
5745349 it was like all of a sudden i realized i could do it and i was like excited to try to do that be a leading man and i saw the amount of good that you can do that you can use that platform to effect change in the world and that was exciting to me

5745353 we must refine the planning system we must have a price for carbon to establish a long term climate for investment we must ensure there is clarity on waste and decommissioning but on no account should there be any kind of subsidy for nuclear power
5745354 and from what the secretary of state has just said our position is by and large similar to the governments
5745355 isnt there a danger with new nuclear that we are going to lock ourselves in rigidly to a technology for the best part of a century when other technologies like carbon capture and storage like renewables are evolving practically every day
5745356 i cant decide whether new nuclear is a white elephant or a red herring
5745357 but very clearly what it isnt is the answer to the energy problems we face today
5745358 im all in favour of reducing emissions i think we can start with what comes out of your mouth
5745359 whats absolutely transparent from your contribution is that what we need and could benefit from in this house is some fresh thinking not a rehash of all the old prejudices that have confused this debate for so long
5745360 the approval of xamiol r opens up for amazing opportunities for leo pharma and the tens of thousands of psoriasis patients that have requested an efficient drug for treatment of the serious and visible scalp psoriasis with the upcoming launch of xamiol r in europe leo has taken a significant step towards realizing our objective to offer patients the best and most complete treatment of their psoriasis with xamiol r the patients get a long sought after drug that will result in an improving difference in their quality of life when it comes to the uncomfortable scalp psoriasis
5745361 xamiol r covers a vast need among the patients and therefore we have great expectations to the product xamiol r forms the first part of a number of new products on their way to the market that will cement leo pharma as the worlds leading pharmaceutical company in particular within the treatment of psoriasis

5745364 the uk energy bill provisions on nuclear power do not extend to scotland this is a great success for the scottish government
5745365 the government believes it is in the public interest that new nuclear power stations should have a role to play in this countrys future energy mix alongside other low carbon sources that it would be in the public interest to allow energy companies the option of investing in new nuclear power stations and that the government should take active steps to open up the way to the construction of new nuclear power stations
5745366 new statistics show that scotland in 2006 supplied 92 5 of its energy needs from fossil fuels renewables and pumped hydro storage
5745367 the risks and uncertainties of new nuclear power in terms of waste disposal decommissioning security and health concerns or cost are obviously far too great
5745368 the bill is actually a further strong argument for the full devolution of responsibility for energy so that we can take the right decisions for the people of scotland
5745369 we will be moving to a world in the next 25 years in which we have more than 1 000 reactors and by mid century i would expect we would have 2 000 to 3 000 reactors in the world
5745370 the nuclear proliferation danger comes not from the existence of nuclear facilities but from the intentions of those who possess them
5745371 the intent of an iran or a north korea is a geopolitical variable virtually independent of whether countries like brazil canada south africa or australia develop additional nuclear facilities
5745372 in most countries which have embraced civilian nuclear power the next step has been towards weapons
5745373 finland and south korea might be exceptions but in britain for example we built the magnox reactors to equip nuclear armed bombers and submarines and to say theres no reason to be concerned about the spread of civilian nuclear power is complacent to the point of being foolhardy
5745374 he obviously hasnt got a clue about the detail of the nuclear cycle its all very well to stand back and make these wild statements but theres a big difference between wishes and reality
5745375 if we look at the amount of what are called conventional resources thats uranium known to be in the ground which is well described there would be enough at current rates of use to last for 85 years
5745376 it is a matter for the power companies to bring forward proposals on the basis that there will be no public subsidies
5745377 very unlikely circumstances of an emergency at a nuclear plant
5745378 we have made it clear that once the right frameworks are in place we will be in a position to move fast move first and move safe
5745379 in this countrys future energy mix alongside other low carbon sources
5745380 affordable and provides one of the cheapest electricity options available to reduce our carbon emissions
5745381 on no account should there be any kind of subsidy for nuclear power
5745382 for the best part of a century when other technologies like carbon capture and storage like renewables are evolving practically every day
5745383 i cant decide whether new nuclear is a white elephant or a red herring but very clearly what it isnt is the answer to the energy problems we face today
5745384 this is bad news for britains energy security and bad news for our efforts to beat climate change

5745391 what kind of message are we sending when police officers refer to the skateboarders as criminals
5745392 there are funds available in the parks reserve and in unforeseen expense this was confirmed to me by the finance dept earlier today
5745393 had there been a will by council to act swiftly on this long overdue project the cao could have confirmed the balance of funds at councils request
5745394 if we have to wait until 2009 to start construction the costs will only go up and that could mean the trillium funding being taken away because of the shortage of funding with a more expensive price tag with costs associated with skate park escalating
5745395 had we built this in 2004 we could have had both phases done for 187 000 now were looking at one phase for 330 000 the costs will only go and its costing more each and every day

5745440 sales of ready to assemble furniture were strong during the most recent quarter ended june 30 despite the overall slowdown in the home furnishings retail sector
5745441 demand for domestically produced product has increased markedly allowing the segments north american two main factories to run much more efficiently and necessitating the need for additional capacity at dowagiac
5745442 the impact of foreign investment is being considered more and more by governments around the world
5745443 this has had an impact on omers in the past in one specific case related to our bid on a toll road in france
5745444 while our bid was competitive on price we lost the bid as a result of our not having a french partner
5745445 one of the reasons we are establishing omers worldwide is to grow our on the ground relationships with local partners across the globe to support our investment areas to bring successful deals to the table
5745446 youre always going to be more successful if you have a local partner
5745447 you can only rely on things like rule of law and proper business practices
5745448 they need to do a lot of due diligence and local partners can always help with some of the nuances
5745449 its unfair to say that its only the foreigners that are having issues we also have foreign investment review and discussions the banks are off the table
5745450 are forgetting that canada and the u s arent always as open as some of these other players foreign investors would like too
5745451 considers it unlikely that such liquidation would have a direct effect on the subsidiaries
5745452 the 75 million of new money we have just received together with our lenders agreement is a vote of confidence in our people our brand and our innovation

5745454 the democrat party is ours we bought it and paid for it
5745455 how about 5 million no but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is im trying to make seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues so it doesnt matter really what my definition of rich is because i dont want to raise anybodys taxes i really dont

5745458 we are in the midst of a fierce correction from a prolonged period of indiscriminate behavior in the credit markets a surfeit of home building a global avalanche of cheap labor and correspondingly cheap imports and other unsustainable financial and economic activity
5745459 i am completely distraught at what has happened but the grounds have been examined this morning and it is absolutely impossible for a stage to be built in these conditions
5745460 even if the rain stops now there isnt enough time for the ground to dry out and the stage to be erected
5745461 which are backed up with affidavits and a bank deposit slip are very serious and may involve criminal conduct

5745465 i romerkirken fins det et eget l repunkt som messens offer det er et l repunkt som protestanter flest synes forst mindre enn lite av en av farene med det er at man da egentlig ikke forst r riktig den arven man selv har f tt fra den protestantiske reformasjonen luther klagde i et av sine reformatoriske hovedskrifter over at hvert barn har l rt at messen er et offer i v r tid er situasjonen n rmest motsatt blant protestanter fins det nesten ikke voksne en gang som vet at romerkirken forst r messen som et offer
5745466 at hebreerbrevets nei til nye ofringer etter kristi golgataoffer gj r det naturlig sp rre hva et eventuelt nytt tempel i jerusalem skal brukes til
5745467 romerkirken har alltid hevdet at man med prestens ublodige offer i messen ikke gjentar kristi blodige offer men protestanter har alltid svart med henvise til at kristi offer p golgata if lge hebreerbrevet var et offer en gang for alle det skal hverken gjentas gjenfremstilles eller samtidiggj res
5745468 det dramatiske med dette sp rsm let er at selve hovedforskjellen mellom romerkirkens hierarkiske kirkestruktur og protestantenes l re om det alminnelige prested mmet springer ut av dette l repunktet mens en katolsk prest er en offerprest latin sacerdotium er en protestantisk prest en mann som tjener troens folk med ord og sakrament latin ministerium
5745469 men hvis de mest endetidsengasjerte proterstantene fremstiller det som totalt uproblematisk med en fremtidig j disk gjenopptagelse av gts stedfortredende dyreofringer i et fjerde endetidstempel vil man jo samtidig annullere en av de mest avgj rende hovedsakene i reformasjonen
5745470 many biotech companies have since been denied grant money or have opted to delay sbir submissions in the hope that this issue will be resolved
5745471 as a result work on life saving and life enhancing technology is being postponed
5745472 the government ought to encourage earlier stage venture capital investments in promising technologies
5745473 to have the sba be an active partner would facilitate the investments

5745478 the number of people in deep poverty has risen by 900 000 since 1997
5745479 a lot of people who in surveys appear to have a low income also have higher spending than people who are better off
5745480 the mismatch between the levels of spending and incomes leads us to think the label of severe poverty is not particularly accurate
5745481 oh man it seemed to take so long but the great thing is that everything is all cool now and i can head that way i got the call and told my mom and we were both just very very thankful

5745484 one of the most pernicious writers is steven plaut a man who could be thought of as israels daniel pipes
5745485 my biggest hope and plea is save the palestinians what israel is doing now exceeds the crimes of the south africa s white regime it has started to take the form of systematic ethnic cleansing which south africa never attempted after 35 years of occupation it is completely clear that the only two choices the israeli political system has generated for the palestinians are apartheid or ethnic cleansing transfer
5745486 i support every form of open criticism against the current policies of the israeli government in the occupied territories whether it is an economic boycott or other forms of resistance a lack of such stances allows israelis to assume that the world is not against them but the world or large parts of it are against them and rightly so

5745491 as we head into the the democratic convention the edwards scandal isnt over its really just beginning dont blame the media blame john edwards so instead of a responsible and swift end to this mess well get the edwards water torture that reduces all politicians especially idealistic ones to same lying bastards that cynics always believed they are cynicism is exactly what republicans want when their opponents message is hope

5745493 we needed a robust and cost efficient solution for our new daily edition after careful evaluation of available editorial solutions we decided to adopt woodwing smart connection as it fits our requirements best
5745494 it used to be that only wealthy high circulation newspapers could afford an editorial workflow system
5745495 by producing an affordable open source editorial workflow system woodwing has given many small to medium sized publications access to the latest in newsroom technology their partner in the region serioustec does a terrific job with installation and theyre extremely responsive when it comes to customer support all of this allowed us to accomplish what might have seemed impossible switching from bi weekly to daily publication going from 50 pages a month to 500 and doing it overnight
5745496 this is our third installation of a new daily newspaper in 18 months it is a privilege to see a new daily being born and we at serioustec have been lucky enough to play a part in some of them lately
5745497 phnom penh post is our first installation in the cambodian market and we are delighted with the successful implementation by serioustecs team
5745498 congratulations to the phnom penh post for successfully launching their first daily edition on august 8 2008
5745499 best system to meet our needs well into the future
5745500 we are working at the ultimate edge of what is possible progressing toward advanced next generation semiconductor technologies
5745501 this new development is a critical achievement in the pursuit to continually drive miniaturization in microelectronics

5745504 intel will try to portray themselves as a juggernaut of innovations but really they are copying many advances amd made years ago
5745505 intel will compare their future products with our current ones but they will neglect to factor in that we will be releasing our 45nm shanghai processor by year end
5745506 our 45nm program is on or ahead of plan in every dimension including schedule frequency operations per clock and yield
5745507 we will be delivering server products first and client products later
5745508 the new btaxxxx triacs from on semiconductor represent the companys entry into the isolated package market for thyristors building on its long history in supplying scrs and triacs
5745509 every designer is under pressure to improve the safety and efficiency of his or her design the new triacs and scrs from on semiconductor can play an important role in any system where safe and efficient ac power switching is required they add additional safety that comes from the very high isolation voltage of a fully internally isolated package and are a compliment to our recently released btbxxx series of triacs
5745510 the 3d em simulator allows our rf module designers to replace standalone tools such as hfss
5745511 as a result weve more than doubled our design efficiency because we can interactively co simulate the circuit and physical 3d effects without leaving the ads design flow
5745512 by allowing processors to focus on computational tasks instead of managing the constant delays required of dma functionality plxs new switch technology offers the opportunity to take up this slack in system latency while delivering a scalable high bandwidth non blocking gen 2 performance interconnection
5745513 as pcie switches have become a fundamental building block in todays designs these feature rich plx chips can help in preliminary architectural considerations
5745514 portable system designers continue to desire more features on their devices which require smaller efficient dc dc converters to maintain long battery life and system runtimes
5745515 the tps62601 gives portable designers access to the smallest thinnest 500ma dc dc solution which simplifies design and reduces board space and time to market

5745524 this partnership with mitsubishi electric demonstrates our continued commitment and ability to deliver flexible cost effective solutions to our enterprise customers and is further validation of our capability to provide network connectivity into china from anywhere in the world
5745525 we are pleased that mitsubishi electric has chosen pacnet to build its network solution in china
5745526 as mitsubishi electric continues to grow in the region we are confident of supporting its growth with our extensive suite of advanced communications solutions which are backed by eac c2c the regions most extensive cable network
5745527 the reorganization of the telecommunication industry in china brings great opportunities for the development of the cdma mobile handset market bundling with mobile operators will be an important distribution channel in the future and the cdma mobile phone market is expected to grow significantly due to the participation of china telecom
5745528 cect will cooperate with via to develop differentiated cdma mobile handsets equipped with unique features and will focus on the bundling with mobile operators in the distribution of the cdma phones in china we believe this strategic cooperation and the new market opportunity will help to enhance our growth and competitiveness
5745529 on the positive side there is more information and education on 3g among the potential users so they are potentially more ready to subscribe however further delays may not bode well for the industry

5745534 before the introduction of high k metal gates many asked whether conventional device architectures could be extended to 22nm but now we have demonstrated that common scaling will still work
5745535 our gate lengths were less than 25nm which was considered impossible a few years ago
5745536 our previous world record for smallest sram cell used e beam lithography which was a major achievement at the time however it is not a production tool you can only fabricate about six wafers a day using e beam lithography
5745537 overall ver 3 1 has no dramatic impact in performance but that is in response to the market that asked for a balanced design with more performance and manageable power consumption
5745538 we have eaten into some of the margin in our electrical specs to maintain trace length and there will be a slight increase in power use that the group has not yet not characterized
5745539 we didnt want to push the connectors to a full 3 1 speed because we wanted to avoid the capacitance it would create on the traces
5745540 our recently released stratix iv family of fpgas was designed from the start to support ht 3 0 and will enable strong performance for htx3 board designs
5745541 as a niche within a niche htx is not going to have volumes or breadth of mainstream boards to rival pcie
5745542 with increasing performance and features for express as well as its momentum its challenging for htx to maintain a long term sustainable position
5745543 i have seen very little use of hypertransport beyond that application except for some cisco systems asics a few years ago
5745544 the electrical validation is our primary challenge the long pole in the tent
5745545 some companies are trying to define these elements in the labs before we release a spec
5745546 at these speeds you really need lab validation not just paper analysis and simulation
5745547 weve done this kind of work before but as you go to faster speeds you need to do more of it
5745548 the type of equalization needed for the 3 0 data rates has not yet been determined the group hopes to complete a ver 0 5 draft of the specification in a couple months
5745549 pcie or pci express is a high speed peripheral interconnect introduced by intel corp
5745550 the stunning image quality produced by amoleds has never been in question
5745551 regardless of this debate the amoled market is set for strong growth over the next few years although volume shipments will be tiny compared to tft lcds
5745552 while mobile handsets are the obvious main target for the technology these phones require multiple sources of suppliers with sufficient volumes to meet demand its unlikely that a single company will be able to fulfill this demand in the short term because no supplier presently has sufficient capacity
5745553 if amoled makers want to stave off tft lcds advance in this arena they must continue to press their advantage on these fronts
5745554 mentor graphics notes that this withdrawal is inconsistent with both cadences recent public statements and recent communications between mentor graphics and cadence
5745555 the real future application in the next five years is solar cooling and we need it badly because we cant afford the soaring cost of cooling anymore
5745556 thermal energy storage is the killer app of concentrating solar power technology
5745557 the technology has steadily improved and is being demanded by utilities
5745558 cost projections are encouraging but future demand will depend on external factors
5745559 solar has become an important part of our resource mix
5745560 the big challenge is transmission because the highest resource potential is remote from population centers
5745561 is an extremely cost effective technology compared with other solar technologies

5745576 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5745577 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5745578 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5745579 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5745580 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5745581 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5745582 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5745583 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5745584 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5745585 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5745586 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5745587 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5745588 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5745589 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

5745617 grilling a tomato does so much for the flavor the flavor of the tomato becomes intensified by grilling it you also get a great flavor from the browning of the tomato since tomatoes are naturally high in sugar the grill caramelizes those sugars and gives the tomato some really great flavor

5745633 only the corporates are on telecoms radar theyre well taken care of with tickets to eden park lavished on them
5745634 really focused on being the best in the toll free market for 0800 and 0508 numbers
5745635 customers include top tier corporates and ma and pa companies
5745636 people come to us because toll free is important to them we are focused on understanding our customers by offering them account management
5745637 theres no point in having great products if they are not the right price or having the right product at the wrong price what they customers need is better service
5745638 they dont realise there are other choices out there and that small telcos are more likely to bring new products to market youre not going to find the you never got fired for buying ibm mentality in the new telco space

5745640 conclusively show that spectrum sensing white space devices will cause harmful interference to wireless microphones during live events
5745641 simply stated the prototype devices were unable to consistently identify operating wireless microphones or distinguish occupied from unoccupied tv channels
5745642 an occurrence that takes place multiple times during any nfl game
5745643 the device did not operate in terms of transmitting a signal because it found that particular channel was occupied
5745644 there would be zero chance of causing any interference to the signals because in that situation there certainly would not be a transmission of the signal in the first place

5745646 the greatest inhibitor is the outmoded mind set of new zealand employers towards staff performance
5745647 the old fashioned view that if people arent in the office theyre skiving
5745648 the need to increase workforce mobility in order to improve productivity is increasing but for small businesses the challenges of managing a remote workforce and the cost of it amp t are still a barrier even if quite functional solutions exist

5745759 a motorist survey this year by the rubber manufacturers association found that 85 percent of american drivers do not properly check tire inflation pressure this is an alarming statistic since tires are the only part of a vehicle in contact with the road and a critical vehicle safety component
5745760 drivers across the u s can battle rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation
5745761 current statistics indicate that 82 million vehicles have under inflated tires which means more rubber is hitting the road and accordingly miles per gallon is lessened in fact tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas is wasted by u s drivers each year simply because theyre driving on under inflated tires

5745781 but this is a lifestyle brand that is specific to one thing the metropolis called ny that is where the challenge and opportunity begins to take shape we have the advantage to take different eras and flavors of new york to create something innovative and new york centric with every single design in fact every single item has a distinct name to fit the collections personality it is a similar approach used in the visual arts

5745940 diplomatic sources in washington described president bush as mr musharrafs last holdout in the us capital others in the bush administration including vice president dick cheney and secretary of state condoleezza rice had long given up on mr musharraf but mr bush remained faithful to the person he considered a close ally and a personal friend
5745941 by the time prime minister gilani met mr bush on july 28 pakistani lobbyists were satisfied that they had neutralised the pro musharraf lobby in washington
5745942 president bush was the last holdout said a think tank expert who worked with the pakistani ambassador to washington but after a good luncheon at the white house with people who had their hearts in the right place mr bush also realised that he can no longer save mr musharraf
5745943 the prime minister took a team of musharraf experts with him to the luncheon and they played a key role in persuading mr bush to stop supporting the pakistani leader
5745944 once this was done the pakistanis knew that the americans will no longer try to save mr musharraf so they made their move for impeachment the expert said
5745945 while mr bush had accepted the argument that mr musharraf could no longer be saved he still wanted to make sure that the pakistani leader was not penalised
5745946 besides sending his own ambassador to the coalition leaders to negotiate a safe exit indemnity from penalisation and a secure stay in pakistan or abroad for mr musharraf mr bush also asked two key allies britain and saudi arabia to help
5745947 after months of belated recognition by american officials that he had become a waning asset in the campaign against terrorism

5745955 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5745956 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5745957 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest

5745963 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane

5745986 weve brought forward our plans to build this road in recognition of the strong population growth thats occurring at bushland beach and the frustration that traffic constraints can cause
5745987 im dearly sorry for what ive done it wasnt me it was the drugs
5745988 when i came into this role and saw the prediction of budget deficits for up to a decade i was horrified
5745989 a business in the private sector would not accept this and ratepayers should not accept it of their business the local council
5745990 through the tough decisions we have taken and some wise investments in the years ahead we believe we can return the budget to a surplus within five years
5745991 residents are trimming household budgets to cope with the current rise in costs and they expect the council to do the same
5745992 one of the major ways the council will achieve savings is by better using the expertise of our staff to reduce the need for external consultants and contractors
5745993 as a single parent myself i understand times of financial burden and the fact that households are struggling with an already stressed budget
5745994 as this is an extra burden on families at the worst possible time i thank everyone who will make sacrifices to find this extra money and in doing so help secure our city for generations
5745995 the community quite rightly expects us to make the hard decisions and were not about to shy away from that
5745996 in the long run this will put us on a more sustainable footing
5745997 i think any rate rise is one that causes consternation in our community and certainly it does to us as councillors having to put that level of rate rise in
5745998 it upsets me that in a time of rising costs we have to ask the average home owner to find a bit extra
5745999 but getting the councils finances back on track is not an easy job
5746000 the pathway toward sound and sustainable financial management is littered with obstacles that we must manage and many of these are not easily moved or avoided
5746001 years of operating in the red have bled the council coffers dry and we can no longer live beyond our means
5746002 we have been told in the clearest way by queensland treasury corporation that we must make these tough decisions as a council or an administrator will be forced to do it for us
5746003 our cost management strategies have been balanced by the need to deliver services programs and facilities to keep our city at the forefront of queenslands regional growth
5746004 this is a budget that focuses on the things that matter to build better infrastructure while exercising strong financial control
5746005 it is an honor to be recognized as the top private school in the triangle

5746011 and its actually a higher profit margin than selling gasoline
5746012 what many of colleagues are not paying attention to is how severe the situation is
5746013 its really part of a national crisis of which we have totally lost the ability to manage finances in this state
5746014 i got my 630 million out and closed the deficit that was left after this years budget
5746015 so i would think that perhaps the legislature can find 600 million of their own and if they can do that i would feel that that would protect us in what would be going on for the rest of the year
5746016 if in event we wind up with the same kind of problem we had let those who feel they can leave albany and leave something nominal on the table let them explain why they have to come back here the next time
5746017 i think the cap is clearly the most important part of the program

5746026 the bush administration is talking about pumping aid into the damaged georgian economy after that nations short war with russia
5746027 the conflict between georgia and russia was tragic but its time officials in washington stopped treating the treasury department like an atm for the world the deficit rose last month after uncle sam had to bail out several failed banks and the total federal deficit this year is going to run about 400 billion its time to say enough
5746028 the u s spent 21 billion on foreign aid last year not counting money for iraq
5746029 over the years washington has shipped hundreds of billions of dollars overseas with much of it wasted the third world remains poor only with a larger debt indeed u s aid programs often subsidized socialist and undemocratic regimes
5746030 the saakashvili government in georgia made a foolish mistake by initiating hostilities in its breakaway province of south ossetia
5746031 american taxpayers should not have to pay for that mistake after all they already are paying 10 billion a month for the administrations mistaken invasion and occupation of iraq they cannot afford to pay the price for other peoples wars as well
5746032 instead of increasing foreign aid the u s government needs to cut the amount of taxpayer money that it sends overseas
5746033 most important it is time to start saying no more no more international welfare clients no more foreign governments treating america as a cash cow we need to put our own fiscal house in order rather than constantly bail out irresponsible governments around the world

5746079 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
5746080 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
5746081 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
5746082 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
5746083 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
5746084 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
5746085 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
5746086 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

5746090 i gave them mathias jorgensens name a long time ago and liverpool are wild about him they are keeping very good track of him

5746095 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5746096 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5746097 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5746098 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5746099 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

5746194 in the period of the second temple the kings of greece issued decrees against the jews invalidated their religion and did not allow them to observe torah and miztvot they confiscated their money and their daughters and they broke into the sanctuary and defiled the pure and the jews suffered greatly and they were very intensely pressured until the g d of their fathers had mercy on them and rescued them from their hands and saved them and the sons of chashmonai the high priests rose up and killed them the greeks and saved the jews from their hands and they appointed a king from the priests and jewish sovereignty returned for more than 200 years until the destruction of the second temple
5746195 the scepter will not leave yehuda nor the ruler from between his legs
5746196 and in my opinion the kings who reigned over israel the kingdom of israel as distinct from the kingdom of judah from the other tribes after david disobeyed their father yaacov
5746197 we are warned not to appoint a king who is not from the people of israel
5746198 i am not na ve i realize that this is problematic

5746205 nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor and whitewash a criminal regime save a collapsing regime and is taking a path to the rearmament of the current leaders in georgia
5746206 one suspects that there is unfinished business here for the russians
5746207 one of their main motivations has been to see the back of saakashvili georgias president putins long time nemesis
5746208 it the delay in retreating is aimed at intimidating him and destabilising the country
5746209 its not business as usual theyre occupying a sovereign nation
5746210 georgia can become a member of the alliance and in my opinion one day will become a member of it the bucharest decision stands
5746211 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used when it wishes to deliver a message that is its military power were determined to deny them their strategic objective

5746216 the non serpentinite rock bodies included in the serpentinite landscape and to a lesser extent calcium bearing accessory minerals in the serpentinite rock have the potential to act as a landscape fertilizer
5746217 these findings suggest that it is important children first learn how to calculate answers on their own but after that initial phase using calculators is a fine thing to do even for basic multiplication facts
5746218 the study indicates technology such as calculators can help kids who already have a strong foundation in basic skills
5746219 for students who did not know many multiplication facts generating the answers on their own without a calculator was important and helped their performance on subsequent tests
5746220 but for students who already knew some multiplication facts it didnt matter using a calculator to practice neither helped nor harmed them
5746221 teachers struggle with how to give kids immediate feedback which we know speeds the learning process so another use for calculators is allowing students to use them to check the answers they have come up with by themselves giving them immediate feedback and more time for practice
5746222 kids enjoyed them its one way to make memorizing your multiplication facts a more interesting thing to do
5746223 so much of how you teach depends on how you market the material presentation is very important to kids
5746224 many of these students had never used a calculator before so it added a fun aspect to math class for them
5746225 its a good tool that some teachers shy away from because they are worried its going to have negative consequences
5746226 i think that the evidence suggests there are good uses of calculators even in elementary school
5746227 these results suggest that a portion of corn stover could be harvested for biofuel production without reducing soil organic carbon levels in high yielding systems however since this study did not study the direct impact of stover removal that aspect remains to be evaluated

5746232 im not saying michigan is going to come out and win the big ten championship this year but within the next four years ill be shocked if they dont in fact its safe to say we expect a national title game within that span
5746233 michigan has had some bad seasons in the past but to almost every michigan fan out there today a bad season is 7 5 or 8 4 sub 500 just doesnt compute for michigan in fact the last time michigan had a losing record was 1967 the last time michigan didnt play in a bowl game was 1975 both streaks are current ncaa division i a records
5746234 the good thing about today because of the weather cooperating weve had lower temperatures higher humidity today is the first day that weve actually been able to directly suppress the fire instead of indirect suppression

5746239 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed

5746284 chosen to study the effects of zero gravity on humans with no end in sight
5746285 similar problems existed in the past when aircrews flew at high altitude and low oxygen levels
5746286 the technological solution of providing oxygen was frowned upon by aviation doctors in favor of trying to negate the effect of the low oxygen through medication today flight crews use oxygen at high altitudes and we expect astronauts to travel with gravity
5746287 the flight hardware will be as simple as possible to maximize our chances for success

5746358 the 4 steps to asking for exactly what you want and nothing less
5746359 focusing on problems to make them go away is not how the universe works focusing on the solutions or more accurately the feeling associated with the outcome of a solution is what allows us to attract whatever solution is best for any given situation
5746360 until you actually do this you will never know how powerful it is the longer and more detailed you make your list the more likely you are to get into the exact vibrational state you want in order to attract what you are writing about
5746361 if you can generate the same emotions you will have when your desire is fulfilled you align vibrationally with the reality of the desire fulfilled and thus become a magnet to it
5746362 this requires some degree of visualization as you visualize or imagine you want to conjure up a reaction from every one of your five senses you want to see hear feel smell and taste your desire being fulfilled and the key is to stay in that state as long as possible
5746363 letting go does not mean to stop wanting what you want
5746364 optimism is the faith that leads to achievement nothing can be done without hope or confidence
5746365 expect to have hope rekindled expect your prayers to be answered in wondrous ways the dry seasons in life do not last the spring rains will come again
5746366 everything that is done in the world is done by hope
5746367 i am profoundly imbued with a sense of awakening because of your veil lifting i was lost but now i am found

5746385 all of the specimens are unclaimed bodies initially received by the bureau of police and then donated to the university and other universities in china for education and research
5746386 traced the whole process none of these bodies would be executed prisoners

5746393 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are basically occupying a large part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convening at whatever level
5746394 but i should add that we certainly do not have the intention to close all doors in our communication with russia
5746395 the behavior of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia
5746396 the united states got precisely what we sought in this statement
5746397 its not everyday that a sovereign country is invaded and wrecked the events of the last few weeks should make us all realize that russia means business
5746398 i hope that i am wrong and that right now these beginnings of these movements which have been signaled but they were also signaled yesterday you know will result in a real departure but i am not sure
5746399 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider

5746401 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5746402 i am sure that such a well conducted effective peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military

5746420 it is probably true that in general the higher the education of the individual becomes the more their views are differentiated if we wish to find a high degree of uniformity and similarity of outlook we have to descend to the regions of lower moral and intellectual standards where the more primitive and common taste prevail this does not mean that the majority of people have low moral standards it merely means that the largest group of people whose values are very similar are the people with low standards it is as it were the lowest common denominator which unites the largest number of people

5746516 i was not very long there until like water i found my own level my people the people who know about oppression discrimination prejudice poverty and the frustration and despair that they produce were not irish americans they were black puerto rican chicano and those who were supposed to be my people the irish americans who know about english misrule and the famine and supported the civil rights movement at home and knew that partition and england were the cause of the problem looked and sounded to me like orangemen they said exactly the same things about blacks that the loyalists said about us at home in new york i was given the key to the city by the mayor an honour not to be sneezed at i gave it to the black panthers
5746517 i think there are two perceptions the perception of me from the outside which sees the north of ireland as them and us catholics and protestants and me therefore as part of one side

5746574 insbesondere in m nchen brauchen wir mehr neue wohnungen sonst steigen die ohnehin sehr hohen mieten noch weiter an
5746575 trotz der allgemein r ckl ufigen baut tigkeit liegt die wohnungsf rderung in der h he der vorjahre und auch die weitere entwicklung stimmt mich zuversichtlich

5746590 for the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard he agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard about the third hour he went out and saw others standing in the market place doing nothing he told them you also go and work in my vineyard and i will pay you whatever is right so they went he went out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did the same thing about the eleventh hour he went out and found still others standing around he asked them why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing because no one has hired us they answered he said to them you also go and work in my vineyard when evening came the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman call the workers and pay them their wages beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first the workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius so when those came who were hired first they expected to receive more but each one of them also received a denarius when they received it they began to grumble against the landowner these men who were hired last worked only one hour they said and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day but he answered one of them friend i am not being unfair to you didnt you agree to work for a denarius take your pay and go i want to give the man who was hired last the same as i gave you dont i have the right to do what i want with my own money or are you envious because i am generous so the last will be first and the first will be last

5746620 preventing the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments is zoning the solution

5746623 all are deeply destructive images that erode male respect for women
5746624 spousal use of pornography and its clinical significance for asian american women
5746625 while erotica has also been defined as literature or art intended to arouse sexual desire it is distinguished from pornography in that it is void of violence illegal portrayals e g children sexism racism and homophobia and is respectful of the human beings involved
5746626 pornography is the material sold in pornography shops for the purpose of producing sexual arousal for mostly male customers second from a critical feminist analysis pornography is a specific kind of sexual material that mediates and helps maintain the sexual subordination of women
5746627 the pursuit of everlasting novelty is the enemy of actual relationship
5746628 in californias unregulated porn film industry an alarming number of performers are infected with hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases and nobody seems to care
5746629 there is a constant demand for new talent and few actresses last more than a year or two checks sometimes bounce the borderline legal status of the industry makes performers reluctant to seek redress in court

5746635 except when the term enters debates among marxists natural is invariably used to preclude any investigation of whether or not people in other societies or in other times may have behaved differently
5746636 in this particular case the argument that pornography is natural ignores the fact that there are men who have given up their obsession with pornography and who have not died
5746637 correlation is not causation but it sure is a hint
5746638 the relationship between particularly sexually violent images in the media and subsequent aggression is much stronger statistically than the relationship between smoking and lung cancer
5746639 the look in her eyes tells us that she would like this bondage session to be over pretty soon forget it girl
5746640 i was told before the video and they said this very proudly mind you that in this line most of the girls start crying because theyre hurting so bad i couldnt breathe i was being hit and choked i was really upset and they didnt stop they kept filming you can hear me say turn the f ing camera off and they kept going
5746641 the love family ideology has no theory of permanence or binding obligation it is oriented to adults interests and satisfactions because it emphasizes freedom of individual choice you can pick the one you love and ditch the one you no longer love without a backward glance thats great for adults but children dont have the same freedom of choice or the same enthusiasm about moving on from a childs standpoint the love family ideology is inadequate because it offers no basis for permanence in family bonds and commitments when these bonds are lost children suffer emotionally especially in their ability to trust weve set up a failure to commit factor for the next generation
5746642 according to a growing body of social scientific evidence children in families disrupted by divorce and out of wedlock birth do worse than children in intact families on several measures of well being
5746643 contrary to popular belief many children do not bounce back after divorce or remarriage difficulties that are associated with family breakup often persist into adulthood children who grow up in single parent or stepparent families are less successful as adults particularly in the two domains of life love and work that are most essential to happiness needless to say not all children experience such negative effects however research shows that many children from disrupted families have a harder time achieving intimacy in a relationship forming a stable marriage or even holding a steady job
5746644 three of the most common mental health problems of girls and women eating disorders low self esteem and depression
5746645 business locations with adult oriented businesses had a significant loss of sales tax collections 42 as compared to control areas
5746646 weve been hearing the community say get rid of it
5746647 this city is right on the edge of a growth spurt cities have windows of opportunity and this is it weve got a problem in that the adult entertainment business acts as a kind of anti gravity force
5746648 years of frustration and community heartache for many local residents

5746659 to suggest that this is somehow an issue that only involves consensual adults thats just not true no matter how these girls and women are packaged for sale the reality is that for many of them their life experience is often wrought with abuse and exploitation

5746661 the distance you get from exchanging cash for sex means that afterwards you dont contemplate the impact on the prostitute
5746662 publications have a choice about whether to run certain ads
5746663 if they have any reason to believe that businesses are conducting illicit activities they have a social responsibility to report it to the authorities or at the very least not run the business advertisements
5746664 the recent investigation and raid of so called massage parlors and spas that were fronting for prostitution once again drive home the obvious these ads are promoting illegal activity and are contributing to the exploitation and trafficking of women

5746726 the haves urban households and the have nots rural households
5746727 this article makes and defends the claim that chinas contemporary household registration system can reasonably be described as a quasi apartheid pass system the historical and ideological underpinnings of the two systems vary greatly and the racial core of the south african system lacking in china led to its eventual demise nevertheless the essence of both systems lies in the use of passes to control the influx of rural migrants into urban areas thereby buttressing cheap labour economies possible explanations for this similarity are presented finally it is argued that in china as in apartheid south africa the pass system is associated with massive abuses of human rights and that its retention should be opposed
5746728 the permanent mark of being an outsider and second class citizen remains and prevents migrant workers from achieving significant upward mobility in cities most decent jobs are still reserved for people who possess local hukou migrants can only get badly paid jobs they still have no future in the cities and may only work there for some years and then return to their home village

5746749 three days with john is like three months with another gymnast
5746750 team coordinator ron brant told me that nobody ever puts in a new routine during the olympics and hits it but ive been working with john four years and once i saw him doing it in practice we were very comfortable putting it in
5746751 then id do the other half later it was too tiring to do all at once but ive done every one of those skills before just never all together in a single routine i trust myself go big or go home thats my motto

5746758 it was just fatigue my coach liang chow was getting nervous and he finally told me to stop to take a second and gather myself so i sat down and settled myself down then i did one good routine before we went out once i was on the beam in the competition i felt calm and just let myself go i didnt worry about the score or the placement i knew in my heart what i deserved

5746857 hes also thinking that revolving the whole storyline around jabba the hutts baby son stinky which is an idea he had scrawled on a cocktail napkin while drunk maybe wasnt such a great idea in retrospect
5746858 he was probably dead before his ice cream cone even hit the ground

5746864 company pitches a television production and nonprofit groups are wary alice stephanie i think you need to be careful here in saying that this is all bad
5746865 well maybe everything is subjective how do you know that using reason is a way to the truth its just one version of the truth and my faith gives me another truth is dependent on how each person sess it
5746866 those who tell you that a man is unable to perceive a reality undistorted by his senses mean that they are unwilling to perceive a reality undistorted by their feelings

5746869 ive always been interested in politics and always felt theres not a good track record of business people going into politics

5746876 i eventually decided to quit without creating a fuss in the supreme national interest
5746877 musharraf had lost his utility as a useful asset for the war on terror
5746878 the americans had been putting pressure on islamabad since february for him to get its act together against the taliban and al qaeda and pakistans foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi and pakistans ambassador to washington husain haqqani always told washington that the government could not move forward independently because of musharraf
5746879 hence musharraf was politely told by washington through various channels to gracefully resign but he remained defiant and ultimately washington pulled its support of him and the ruling coalition moved for his impeachment which forced him to resign
5746880 the army will play the same role it played from 1996 to 1998
5746881 the american role has always been paramount in pakistans politics the late general zia ul haq was defiant of washingtons interests and he faced an accidental death in a mysterious plane accident in 1988 had musharraf tried to exercise his constitutional powers to dissolve the assemblies he would also have been obstructing american interests in the region and would have faced a zia like fate
5746882 now the americans will have to use the two remaining national assets for their interests the political parties and the army chief kiani washington abhors nawaz sharif so they will distance themselves from him and focus on asif zardari the widower of benazir bhutto and head of the ppp
5746883 zardari because of corruption cases that have been leveled against him can be easily manipulated and therefore he will act obediently on their advice
5746884 i suspect that kiani is already part of their game
5746885 yes he could be the one but asfandyar failed to uphold his promised role to control militancy in the tribal areas without resort to military operations
5746886 in my opinion nawab attaullah mengal a baloch politician should be the president of the country given the recent mistreatments done in balochistan province in the name of military operations
5746887 there was no reason to use such brute force in a tribal area like bajaur
5746888 the only reason for such military action was to destroy the talibans approaches to kunar where american forces are all out to get the taliban kunar province lies in the northeast and connects to kabul previously the taliban were focused only on southeastern provinces
5746889 this is the role washington wants the pakistani army to play the cost is paid by pakistanis and 250 000 people were displaced during the bajaur operation
5746890 there remain significant external risks presented by the deterioration in the broader economic outlook and the continuing turbulence in financial markets
5746891 the a amp l board sees no obvious circumstances that are likely materially to improve conditions in the financial markets or the broader economic outlook in the near to medium term
5746892 the a amp l board also recognises the risk that further shocks to the financial system created by unfavourable developments at other financial institutions could generate widespread general adverse sentiment towards financial groups like a amp l
5746893 the a amp l board has concluded therefore that there is a risk of external events further eroding shareholder value and that the value to a amp l shareholders of the greater certainty provided by being part of a larger organisation is considerable

5746917 demand for good commercial farmland is still strong mainly because of lack of supply
5746918 demand for smaller units is starting to cool because they are fundamentally unviable although anything with arable acres and the larger stock farms are going well
5746919 the latter may be struggling to sell a house or to borrow money
5746920 the market was telling us that this sort of buyer had disappeared but we saw lots of them
5746921 all of the people in the coach are workers on our farm they had a day off to go to alton towers they do this kind of thing quite often

5746929 the coach that was involved in the tragic accident yesterday was returning from alton towers with a group of our staff after one such day out
5746930 the long family knows many of those injured personally and the young man who was sadly killed had worked on our farm for the last three summers
5746931 our thoughts are with his family and loved ones and also with those others who have been seriously injured
5746932 we are deeply distressed by the tragic incident and would appreciate being left to help our staff and their families to the best of our ability at this difficult time
5746933 our crews are now working with a specialist heavy rescue team who have been called in to support the operation to recover the coach
5746934 we send our sincere sympathies and condolences to all involved and the families of the deceased and injured

5746958 el reconocimiento de los rostros lo logran sin esfuerzo personas de todas las culturas diferentes y por ello se consideraba como un mecanismo universal entre los humanos
5746959 sin embargo el uso de una novedosa tecnolog a de imagen cerebral ha permitido el descubrimiento de que las diferencias culturales causan que miremos a los rostros de manera distinta
5746960 demuestran que el procesamiento de rostros no puede considerarse como algo que surge de una serie universal de eventos perceptuales
5746961 la estrategia empleada para extraer informaci n visual de los rostros difiere con las culturas
5746962 en una serie de estudios del movimiento de los ojos mostramos que la experiencia social tiene un impacto sobre la forma en que las personas miran a los rostros
5746963 espec ficamente notamos una gran diferencia en los movimientos de los observadores occidentales y los del este de asia
5746964 encontramos que los occidentales tienden a mirar rasgos espec ficos en el rostro de un individuo tales como los ojos o la boca en tanto que los observadores del este de asia tienden a enfocarse en la nariz o el centro de la cara lo cual da una visi n m s general de todos los rasgos
5746965 el excesivo contacto directo de ojos puede considerarse rudo en las culturas de asia oriental
5746966 brinda nuevos elementos para entender por qu la comunicaci n no verbal entre personas de culturas diferentes a veces es problem tica
5746967 en una era en la cual la globalizaci n ha incrementado enormemente la interdependencia la integraci n y la interacci n entre personas y corporaciones de todo el mundo
5746968 las sociedades occidentales son en general m s individualistas en tanto que las sociedades orientales son colectivistas los occidentales al parecer piensan y perciben de manera m s enfocada y los orientales globalmente
5746969 al refutar la presunci n tradicional de que el procesamiento de rostros se logra de una manera universal hemos mostrado que el ambiente incluida la sociedad en la cual nos desarrollamos tiene mucha influencia en los mecanismos humanos b sicos

5746977 and for almost that long senator mccain has been part of the problem for decades he has stood with the big oil companies and voted against the development of the alternative energy we need when a critical proposal came before the senate late last year that would have provided tax incentives for the development of alternative energy by revoking 13 billion in giveaways to the oil companies he was the only senator who didnt vote and we came up one vote short

5747027 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5747028 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5747029 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5747030 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental

5747041 these findings suggest that it is important children first learn how to calculate answers on their own but after that initial phase using calculators is a fine thing to do even for basic multiplication facts
5747042 the study indicates technology such as calculators can help kids who already have a strong foundation in basic skills
5747043 for students who did not know many multiplication facts generating the answers on their own without a calculator was important and helped their performance on subsequent tests
5747044 but for students who already knew some multiplication facts it didnt matter using a calculator to practice neither helped nor harmed them
5747045 teachers struggle with how to give kids immediate feedback which we know speeds the learning process so another use for calculators is allowing students to use them to check the answers they have come up with by themselves giving them immediate feedback and more time for practice
5747046 kids enjoyed them its one way to make memorizing your multiplication facts a more interesting thing to do
5747047 so much of how you teach depends on how you market the material presentation is very important to kids
5747048 many of these students had never used a calculator before so it added a fun aspect to math class for them
5747049 its a good tool that some teachers shy away from because they are worried its going to have negative consequences
5747050 i think that the evidence suggests there are good uses of calculators even in elementary school

5747094 queremos convocar a una plataforma amplia de organizaciones y movimientos para cuestionar el mercosur de los monocultivos que nos impone el mercado global coordinar estrategias de campa as de resistencia a nivel regional y romper la divisi n campo ciudad en lo p blico y pol tico queremos mostrar la cara pol tica del agronegocio y denunciar los devastadores proyectos de pa s y sociedad que implican para el presente y las futuras generaciones
5747095 incorporar el concepto mismo del agronegocio con todo lo que implica de cadenas agroalimentarias de supermercados pero sobre todo de conversi n del agricultor en un hombre que hace negocios es lo que se llama el agrobusiness un concepto que en la argentina se extendi mucho y que ahora se est extendiendo por el resto de am rica latina debemos verlo como un desaf o a encarar por los movimientos sociales
5747096 es indiscutible que la producci n agroindustrial de soja a gran escala con fines de exportaci n conlleva graves consecuencias para el medio ambiente y la salud de nuestras comunidades y ecosistemas presenciamos la destrucci n de la tierra f rtil el desmonte de los bosques nativos la contaminaci n de la tierra y el agua con agrot xicos las fumigaciones con glifosato de los campos la p rdida de biodiversidad el desalojo de miles de campesinos agricultores las inundaciones los efectos catastr ficos en los r os y el clima y por supuesto la inequidad social la pobreza la malnutrici n y la p rdida de nuestra soberan a alimentaria todo eso como resultado del fortalecimiento e intensificaci n de la sojizaci n de am rica latina
5747097 este mundo que nosotros conocemos tiene una matriz el petr leo pero el petr leo se est terminando y adem s ya no es redituable porque no da patentes y lo que viene ahora es la matriz de la soja es la matriz de la biotecnolog a de las semillas transg nicas de la nanotecnolog a y de los biocombustibles es la matriz de las alconaftas del etanol de los biocombustibles provenientes de la soja
5747098 del genocidio y robo de tierras al boom sojero historia pol tica y econ mica de la provincia de santa fe
5747099 algunos pa ses de europa est n sustituyendo 2 a 5 por ciento de la nafta usada en los autom viles por biocombustibles y se piensa llegar al 10 por ciento la argentina y el brasil son pa ses que van a tener que producir nada m s que biocombustibles el tema es qu va a comer nuestra poblaci n porque en este proyecto si nosotros tenemos que abastecer el mercado de la energ a europea no vamos a tener qu comer el biocombustible sale del aceite y el resto de la soja qui n se lo va a comer nosotros evidentemente
5747100 ya no les va a convenir hacer otra cosa como forrajes preparar harina de soja entonces todo eso va a quedar como un residuo que evidentemente ser la nica comida que va a haber lo cu l es grav simo
5747101 esto nos preocup empezamos a entender por qu en muchas de las entrevistas que tenemos con funcionarios o con dirigentes pol ticos ciertos temas no aparecen es que los pol ticos los ignoran descubrimos que los pol ticos ignoran que son las empresas las que hoy dibujan o generan muchas de las pol ticas de estado que la argentina tiene
5747102 toda la negociaci n de tierras y la negociaci n de la madera del bosque de el impenetrable chaque o que desapareci todo eso va siendo empujado por la soja primero viene la negociaci n de la madera y despu s llega la soja
5747103 en las provincias de buenos aires o santa fe el deterioro del suelo va a demorar en evidenciarse porque son suelos muy ricos se puede haber perdido una tercera parte o la mitad del suelo pero de todas maneras queda suelo y hay capacidad para poner fertilizantes qu micos cuando antes jam s se hubieran usado pero hay suelos fr giles como los del desmonte del chaco que dan para 2 o 3 cosechas y despu s va a quedar s lo el desierto
5747104 los gobiernos no hacen nada porque van detr s del inter s de corto plazo de un gran negocio tres cosechas despu s se acab no tenemos un secretario de medioambiente que diga nada y el exterminio de flora y fauna es angustiante para la gente que se preocupa por los ecosistemas
5747105 los planes econ micos aplicados en distintos per odos de nuestra historia como sucedi en los 90 han contribuido no s lo a mantener sino a profundizar el proceso de concentraci n de tierras
5747106 a tal punto esto es as que tomando como base los establecimientos agropecuarios productivos de m s de 5 000 hect reas el censo agropecuario de 1913 mostraba que 5 300 terratenientes eran due os del 48 por ciento de las tierras y el censo 2001 puso en evidencia que algo m s de 6 mil propietarios controlan 50 por ciento de las mismas
5747107 la soja ha despoblado el campo porque ha establecido un modelo de agricultura sin agricultores ahora tenemos ciudades inmanejables con mucha violencia mucha inseguridad sin trabajo en las cuales faltan redes de gas de cloacas de agua porque el estado no da abasto para construir infraestructura urbana la gente vive como puede lo que ha habido es un cambio demogr fico brutal cerca del mil pueblos del interior han quedado pr cticamente vac os y la emigraci n contin a no hay un d a en que no haya nuevos despoblamientos consecuencia de la soja

5747111 our analysis clearly shows incredible growth in online pc gaming proof that this industry is far stronger than anyone has reported
5747112 by pioneering new business models the pc has quietly remained the single leading platform for games not only in terms of consumer usage but revenue generation
5747113 the most fascinating thing about pc gaming is its ability to attract such a diverse audience both demographically and geographically the real key has been the rapid growth in penetration of broadband connected pcs in all markets around the world broadband connected pcs are the key driver of growth for pc gaming dfc intelligence estimated that by the end of 2007 less than one third of households in the top 20 markets for games had a high speed internet connection that clearly indicates that there is still plenty of growth to come the initiatives of the pcga will be a key enabler of growth as they will help the industry identify key trends and opportunities in this rapidly emerging market

5747267 appropriate nondiscriminatory treatment to all transgender and gender variant individuals
5747268 this trend underscores the need for psychologists to acquire greater knowledge and competence in addressing transgender issues
5747269 psychologists who work with clients with gender identity issues are not of one mind on this issue
5747270 accordingly if there were evidence showing the gid diagnosis to be similarly harmful and discriminatory against gender variant transgender or transsexual people there would be a precedent for a resolution discouraging psychologists from using this diagnosis
5747271 however there is a great deal of disagreement about the gid diagnosis and whether it is helpful or harmful therefore the task force does not recommend that apa take a position on gid at this time

5747288 the problem in applying stereotype threat to uk medical students is that the majority of ethnic minority medical students here are from south asian backgrounds and it is not fully clear whether negative stereotypes exist about that group
5747289 the aim of the study was to establish if negative stereotypes about that group do exist and thus if stereotype threat might be one reason that uk ethnic minority medical students are underperforming academically
5747290 the fact that these negative stereotypes exist raises the possibility that stereotype threat may be occurring
5747291 its clear from our results that more research needs to be done into the effects of stereotype threat in uk medical schools and in fostering positive educational relationships between all students and their clinical teachers

5747297 the cmha looks forward to working closely with the commission in achieving its challenging mandate which will be much more feasible with this support
5747298 the presumptive democratic presidential nominee will announce his running mate

5747316 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5747317 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5747318 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
5747319 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt
5747320 we both tried to do some training along the lines of going down to our little gym but that was pretty much it
5747321 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses
5747322 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5747323 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5747324 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane

5747345 is there a difference between dying for freedom and killing for freedom
5747346 the funny part is that we kept on recording the number
5747347 its not trannyshack unless you get hit by bologna or a shoe
5747348 we never thought wed be doing it for this long and it would become internationally renowned and change drag culture
5747349 because it hasnt just changed drag culture in san francisco its changed drag culture worldwide
5747350 nineteen ninety five was a very sad year for me everyone who had influenced me in san francisco died during that year
5747351 i just remember funerals one after another that year i remember what influenced me were the smaller clubs like klubstitute and i thought i could do that it was the punk aesthetic the diy thing for me 1996 when trannyshack started it was when new aids medications were coming out and it felt like a celebration
5747352 every week id take these empty budweiser beer boxes like 50 of them and stack them up and staple fabric around it and that was the stage
5747353 i remember there was a gap between the boxes and one night martiny fell in between the gap it looked like her legs were severed
5747354 it was kind of normal at the time but i remember it being shocking because we couldnt get her out
5747355 you can get away with being bohemian and couch surfing and partying in your 20s in your 30s not so cute in your 40s no one wants to talk to you
5747356 bohemia does not age well if you dont move on
5747357 it started out as a parody of a parody the imperial court coronations which was a parody of miss america
5747358 all you have to do is look at the attendance that night
5747359 i remember getting to the stud and i was running late and there was a huge line down the street the marketing the enthusiasm the anticipation made it a real event also it was only that year we had a performer who was just from another planet what was her name
5747360 plenty yente a nice jewish boy who was studying the flute
5747361 for some people it was a big deal but a cool thing about trannyshack is that everyone is accepted
5747362 even when youre doing conventional drag you dont have to put on traditional makeup or breasts
5747363 it was never my intention to become this drag thing with this institution
5747364 when you are the establishment and you realize that then i think for me i need to quit

5747371 consumers have embraced the dvd format like no other technology and invested in large libraries of their favourite movies

5747376 this new development is a critical achievement in the pursuit to continually drive miniaturisation in microelectronics
5747377 we are working at the ultimate edge of what is possible progressing towards advanced next generation semiconductor technologies
5747378 we have already started the planning for an integrated product and we aim to have this available as soon as possible
5747379 from a product perspective this acquisition will propel the company forward
5747380 registration is refused because the applied for mark merely describes a feature and characteristic of applicants services
5747381 in addition to being merely descriptive the applied for mark appears to be generic in connection with the identified services and therefore incapable of functioning as a source identifier for applicants services
5747382 people are wary of draining their battery and not being able to make calls
5747383 battery life is not helped by having gps and wi fi turned on nor by having a large bright screen for navigation or web browsing
5747384 but there is clear demand for those features and applications and advances in battery technology would enable quite substantial changes in usage patterns with all the service revenue benefits that would bring
5747385 scotland has become famous for its call centres but this is the wrong end of the value chain to concentrate on

5747414 chosen to study the effects of zero gravity on humans with no end in sight
5747415 similar problems existed in the past when aircrews flew at high altitude and low oxygen levels
5747416 the technological solution of providing oxygen was frowned upon by aviation doctors in favor of trying to negate the effect of the low oxygen through medication today flight crews use oxygen at high altitudes and we expect astronauts to travel with gravity
5747417 the flight hardware will be as simple as possible to maximize our chances for success
5747418 were not the first to do this nasa carried out tethered artificial gravity generation experiments during the gemini program in the 1960s but never got back to it in the apollo shuttle or space station eras artificial gravity is important for a mars bound crew so we will take the concept forward

5747435 the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honor the words of president dimitry medvedev to abide by the six point peace plan which is not happening at the moment
5747436 a new line in europe where russia somehow asserts that there are those who cannot opt for a trans atlantic future is unacceptable
5747437 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5747438 we are very disappointed because despite the promise to us there is no withdrawal of troops
5747439 when you sign up to an agreement you have to respect it
5747440 we dont want to use this sort of pressure but we also dont want this document the peace deal to remain a dead letter

5747452 marriage is for our good but it is first for gods glory

5747456 our true needs are met in breathtaking array in christ but it is a road of constant surprises because we drive it with full awareness of our sin in light of the cross
5747457 transformation takes place in the midst of daily hustle and bustle the kids still need to be fed and the bills paid while we struggle through our brokenness it can be discouragingly hard to focus on more than one area of growth at a time
5747458 in the end all the countless waits large and small and the hopes that accompany them are part of our greater waiting and our ultimate hope
5747459 will we recognize it as gods love for us entrusting to us a suffering spouse to care for and love through the trials

5747579 all that is required is for the philippines even as a non state party to the rome statute that created the icc to give its ad hoc consent to the exercise of jurisdiction by the court
5747580 the most obvious advantage of prosecuting the milf in the hague would be that it would prevent the milf from requiring as condition precedent for the continuation of the peace talks that their men should not be subject to criminal prosecution by local courts
5747581 further the powerful organization of islamic states will inevitably also exert its influence in insisting that milf commanders and men when even when they commit war crimes should not be subject to local criminal prosecutions
5747582 because under international law war crimes are crimes committed against the international community these domestic considerations will not and cannot deprive the icc of jurisdiction what would instead be required would be for the philippines merely to give its ad hoc consent for the court to prosecute the milf
5747583 what is non negotiable though is that no combatant be it from the armed forces of the philippines the milf or the npa when they commit war crimes should be left unpunished for their acts
5747584 you all know we have bent as far backward as possible to give peace a chance

5747588 we cannot allow our women and children to be snatched from under our noses we need to wage a full scale war in order to fight human trafficking in all fronts from source communities to transit areas like ports and airports even in the points of destination we need to attack the business of traffickers who have mastered the art of deception coercion fraud and exploitation of the victims vulnerabilities
5747589 as worldwide recruitment relies on intricate processes that start in far flung communities
5747590 activities like this today are really important because it brings this issue to regular peoples living room everyday and there maybe people who know of someone trafficked or have a cousin a sister or brother and can spread that message activities like this are terrific
5747591 weve contributed about 2m here in the last few years working mostly with the visayan forum to build halfway houses to help in prevention to help train people in prosecution we do all that of course in conjunction with philippine government partners and we will keep on doing that this is incredibly an important issue
5747592 this is a war we should all be proud of to take part in this is a war that saves innocent lives this is a crime that robs children women and some men of their dignity of their dreams and of their future and we wont let it happen
5747593 origin has developed a leading position in coal seam gas in australia and the strength of this position will be a key driver for continuing growth
5747594 origin has outstanding prospects as a strongly performing australian integrated energy company with increasing exposure to growing demand and higher prices for australias natural resources
5747595 directors believe it is in shareholders best interests to reject bgs bid
5747596 whilst equity markets and energy prices decline and coal seam gas companies share prices fall origin is telling its shareholders to wait for an uncertain and unclear outcome from its monetisation process and reject the certain value of bg groups a 15 50 7 22 all cash offer
5747597 theres a sense that origin has gotten quite a positive response on its coal seam gas monetisation process but thats still in early days so its hard to decide which is a better option
5747598 theres a high chance they will wait until they get more details of the coal seam gas monetisation proposals origin has received but they could also make a pre emptive strike and launch a higher offer

5747606 if we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart then we will misunderstand this moment and miss its opportunities
5747607 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5747608 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not
5747609 and he declared behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has so many times that i put personal ambition before my country
5747610 that is john mccains prerogative he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how political campaigns have been run in recent years but i believe the american people are better than that
5747611 i believe that this defining moment demands something more of us
5747612 proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for an additional one billion dollars in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia
5747613 unlike barack obama john mccain doesnt have to compensate for a lack of credibility on the international stage with inflammatory and public threats against american allies
5747614 the american people know that john mccain will hunt down terrorists wherever they are and have a choice between strength and experience versus barack obamas rhetoric and theatrics
5747615 i would argue that if you are making more than 250 000 then you are in the top 3 4 percent of this country
5747616 i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
5747617 the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues it doesnt matter really what my definition of rich is because i dont want to raise anybodys taxes

5747660 a large fraction of americans know that we need a jeffersonian political revolution to fix our corrupt system they were not fooled by the obama rhetoric about change not from someone that has been a product of and servant for the two party plutocracy yes all the votes for me and the other third party presidential candidates spelled the difference between obama winning and losing our voters correctly protested against the corrupt two party system they did not elect mccain only those who voted for mccain elected him and that is something they must live with as they watch a mccain administration continue dismantling american democracy and budget busting global warmongering
5747661 it is time to stop saying god bless america and begin repeating god save america the good news is that we will build even greater public support for a true political revolution during the mccain presidency all too often things must get much worse before they can get better they will get worse

5747676 arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5747677 it might be good for your asian and african childrens self esteem to know you support a brown man for the leader of the free world
5747678 now go back to making your movies about women who love to handle big guns that shoot hundreds of people to death
5747679 until we have a clear sense of what will prevail monetary policy makers must remain poised to act if slowing growth fails to contain inflationary pressures
5747680 unless the python that is the u s economy can quickly pass the recent burst of cost push pressures we risk a reinforcing spreading of inflationary impulses and expectations
5747681 should this happen and the fed were to fail to address it we would run the risk of losing the publics confidence in our ability to constrain inflation
5747682 the core figure will certainly disappoint fed members concerned about upward price pressure becoming difficult to reverse
5747683 todays data tell us more about the underlying secular pressures driving inflation higher but the story has been overtaken for the time being by the many cyclical pressures driving inflation lower
5747684 the distortions in the housing data should nullify some of their market impact though the headline decline could be bullish for treasuries and bearish for the dollar and stocks
5747685 is not treating the obesity crisis with the seriousness it deserves
5747686 the only thing going down is the money spent to prevent this epidemic
5747687 there needs to be a sense of urgency and outright alarm
5747688 this is the fifth f as in fat report and each year we see more evidence that our nations obesity epidemic continues to gain speed and destructive force
5747689 a strategy alone is insufficient if resources are not placed behind it

5747699 the first and most important key on email archiving is to understand that you need one however since it administrators in smes are often overworked and required to do tasks that an administrator in a large business would never dream of doing it comes as no surprise that many that do rely on end users to manage it themselves this can cause even bigger problems as human error is probably the most critical security vulnerability facing storage environments in small and medium sized enterprises
5747700 for businesses around the world email has become the primary means of communication with people inside and outside of the organization yet businesses fail to realize that each email communication sent or received is probably the only record they have of important transactions with a customer or between members of staff many organizations underestimate the value of knowledge that is stored in corporate email email contains the bulk of the information that individuals use on a daily basis therefore the amount of corporate knowledge stored in email is enough to justify its safekeeping over long periods of time

5747702 villas at west road is a well located high quality community in a strong houston submarket
5747703 it is our final acquisition in our second fund which now owns five high quality communities in the southeast and southwest we continue to favor apartments the current climate in which there is less financing and less equity capital for acquisitions provides an opportunity for us to grow our apartment portfolio and we plan to continue to take advantage of this climate
5747704 we like houston and we are very bullish on the sam houston tollway west road location of the villas at west road which is walking distance from neighborhood shopping there are also a number of things that we find appealing in the community for houston it has very low density at 12 units to the acre all of the apartment homes are two story and have private first floor entrances and 70 of the apartments have attached garages the community has a great feel and is a very desirable place to live
5747705 it is a property that can maintain high occupancy lower turnover and consistently outperform the market

5747716 there is so much that goes into moving a household including making the transition for our pets
5747717 were thrilled to be working with some of the worlds best pet experts to offer alternative options for our furry friends for what can be a very scary situation we continue to listen to our customers needs to make all aspects of their families move seamless
5747718 they have guns and they hunt it is very disturbing they also raise chickens these are their only interests are you looking for chickens
5747719 i am looking for friends what does that mean tame
5747720 to me you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys and i have no need of you and you on your part have no need of me to you i am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes but if you tame me then we shall need each other to me you will be unique in all the world to you i shall be unique in all the world
5747721 there is a flower i think that she has tamed me
5747722 i hunt chickens men hunt me all the chickens are just alike and all the men are just alike and in consequence i am a little bored but if you tame me it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life i shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground yours will call me like music out of my burrow and then look you see the grain fields down yonder i do not eat bread wheat is of no use to me the wheat fields have nothing to say to me and that is sad but you have hair that is the color of gold think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me the grain which is also golden will bring me back the thought of you and i shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat
5747723 but i have not much time i have friends to discover and a great many things to understand
5747724 men have no more time to understand anything they buy things all ready made at the shops but there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship and so men have no friends any more if you want a friend tame me
5747725 first you will sit down at a little distance from me like that in the grass i shall look at you out of the corner of my eye and you will say nothing words are the source of misunderstandings but you will sit a little closer to me every day
5747726 it would have been better to come back at the same hour
5747727 if for example you come at four oclock in the afternoon then at three oclock i shall begin to be happy i shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances at four oclock i shall already be worrying and jumping about i shall show you how happy i am but if you come at just any time i shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you one must observe the proper rites
5747728 they are what make one day different from other days one hour from other hours there is a rite for example among my hunters every thursday they dance with the village girls so thursday is a wonderful day for me i can take a walk as far as the vineyards but if the hunters danced at just any time every day would be like every other day and i should never have any vacation at all
5747729 i never wished you any sort of harm but you wanted me to tame you
5747730 go and look again at the roses you will understand now that yours is unique in all the world then come back to say goodbye to me and i will make you a present of a secret
5747731 as yet you are nothing no one has tamed you and you have tamed no one you are like my fox when i first knew him he was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes but i have made him my friend and now he is unique in all the world
5747732 and now here is my secret a very simple secret it is only with the heart that one can see rightly what is essential is invisible to the eye
5747733 it is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important
5747734 it is the time i have wasted for my rose
5747735 but you must not forget it you become responsible forever for what you have tamed you are responsible for your rose
5747736 seed selection is one of the most important investments a corn grower can make
5747737 this program recognizes the reduced annual production risk that comes from using advanced seeds and technologies that have the possibility to increase yields and places that value back in the hands of growers
5747738 we will begin by assessing every player we will assess the local players and the foreign based players
5747739 absolutely everybody registered as a ghanaian player has got a chance i will monitor players from the ghanaian league and the foreign based players in their respective leagues
5747740 i dont intend to build a new team or make a big change but it is a fresh beginning for all there will be equal opportunities for all
5747741 but i will build my team around stephen appiah john mensah micheal essien sulley muntari and john paintsil they are the spine of the team
5747742 i believe in the ability of the ghana national team to qualify for the world cup once again
5747743 its a wonderful challenge which wouldnt be easy but i am hopeful of leading ghana to south africa
5747744 this particular process just emphasises the personalised nature of this prosecution the malice the vindictiveness behind it
5747745 capacity development for pro poor private sector led growth through enhancing corporate governance
5747746 the development of the small and medium scale enterprise sector is particularly important for employment creation and equitable distribution of wealth and opportunity and thus poverty reduction

5747748 learning which can immediately render benefit to adults in every field of endeavour
5747749 all programmes would require that providers of adult education must themselves update their skills so as to provide useful knowledge and skills for their clientele
5747750 the good news is that there have not been any reported deaths
5747751 i am challenging all those people who are also saying that they believe in ghana to prove what is it they say they are going to do that will take us really forward
5747752 we cannot continue to do things against ourselves and expect that the ghanaian will be enthusiastic to perform in his or her own country
5747753 you cannot have citizens who can utilize science and technology successfully if they are not educated
5747754 free compulsory and continuous education all three elements together from kindergarten to senior high school including building the same standard school facility in the same compound

5747757 this installation at denver international airport fits with our greenprint denver action agenda for sustainability and our pledge to do all that we can to reduce our carbon footprint
5747758 we are proud to have such a large and prominently placed solar power system at dia this installation is both a symbol and a practical example of the citys commitment to renewable energy
5747759 dia has a long standing commitment to sustainable operations and environmental protection this project makes a visible environmental statement to the millions of passengers that travel through our airport
5747760 we are delighted that such a major metropolitan airport as denver international has embarked on a solar energy system that is as impressive in scope as this two megawatt installation which is the equivalent in size to seven football fields in addition our expertise in designing and installing commercial scale solar systems enabled us to address the complex power needs of a major transportation hub like denver international
5747761 by securing power through a power purchase agreement rather than major capital investment dia will benefit from a renewable energy system that is cost effective from its very first day of operation and for years to come
5747762 our collaborative effort serves as an example of how successful public private partnerships can help municipal facilities make the most of tax credits and other incentives available for solar energy
5747763 as a leading global solar provider sharp is proud to be part of this tremendous effort to help denver achieve its ambitious sustainability goals this solar pv system will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions electricity costs and grid constraints while helping to improve denvers air quality and the regions overall environment
5747764 this project is right in line with the clean energy future we envision at xcel energy
5747765 we were pleased to play a role in helping denver and colorado meet the ambitious goals its leaders have set with the renewable energy standard and greenprint denver
5747766 schools stopped shopping for me so i had to start shopping for a school that was the right for me
5747767 football is a beautiful and fun game but it is also unforgiving
5747768 my parents instilled in me to have a back up plan because anything can happen in football especially injuries
5747769 then boom out of no where a freak injury happens at first i was in denial and didnt want to believe my season was over
5747770 he came back for the bowl game and finished strong he helped finish the season strong
5747771 he is a smart kid and he cares about the program
5747772 we have a challenging schedule and he has the opportunity to write the script and make things happen
5747773 ike has already finished school and now needs to finish athletically
5747774 he has one last chapter to write here at fresno state and we are excited for the results
5747775 on a football team there are 100 different personalities and you learn to respect them all
5747776 i have learned to communicate with people and respect there difference which will help in any career
5747777 i am happy to be here to start a new challenge in africa
5747778 it has taken us over a month to get a replacement for csaba but the wait has finally paid off with a young qualified and highly experienced coach
5747779 weve seen a lot of mosquitoes and its going to continue were going to see numbers of mosquitoes that we havent seen for many years
5747780 you dont have to worry about wildlife or animals drinking out of a pond
5747781 because it is something that is real specific to mosquito larvae
5747782 mosquitoes arent attracted to light they find us by detecting carbon dioxide and other odors we give off
5747783 there are a number of simple things to do to save a few dollars on your fuel budget
5747784 all vehicles are different and will experience various levels of savings but there are a few of the basics that work for all types of cars and trucks
5747785 farmers dont have to wait for new technology money saving ideas are out there
5747786 they can practice energy conservation often with little or no investment
5747787 the fuel used for getting the crop established in no till is about half compared to using intensive tillage
5747788 making use of cover crops to capture nitrogen can cut commercial purchases by 50 to 100 pounds per acre
5747789 the value of a legume is that you are growing nitrogen and the value of a non legume like ryegrass is that you are storing nitrogen either way thats less commercial fertilizer you have to add to the soil and there will be less available nitrogen over winter to leach and end up in a stream or lake
5747790 we still need to get more information out to farmers so they can feel confident in managing a cover crop
5747791 soybeans rotated with corn supplies nitrogen for the corn crop yields are usually higher compared to continuous corn
5747792 as rtk real time kinetic auto steering becomes more affordable it makes controlled traffic a much easier decision for farmers
5747793 the accuracy of auto steering makes it easier for farmers to drive in the same path year after year
5747794 the ventilation system inlets and exhaust fans should be checked an inlet opening thats too wide could result in poor distribution of fresh air in winter any excess ventilation above the minimum required for the animals is using more fuel to heat the air
5747795 they cost more but they use less electricity and last much longer
5747796 on the average farm the majority of tires are over inflated
5747797 over inflation causes excess slippage keeping tires at the correct pressure improves traction floatation and wear
5747798 you want enough weight to eliminate excess slippage but you also want to remove ballast when it is not needed
5747799 when pulling a load the correct amount of slippage is 8 to 12 percent on a firm surface and 10 to 16 percent on soft ground
5747800 a partially plugged fuel filter cuts down the amount of fuel getting to the engine thereby losing power
5747801 dont let a diesel engine idle more than about 10 minutes
5747802 research shows its less efficient to keep an engine idling for warmth than it is to re start it of course results may change in extremely cold weather
5747803 dont subsoil 16 inches if going 12 inches deep is doing the job
5747804 keeping any ground engaging tools sharp makes a big difference when it comes to saving fuel and improving speed and field efficiency

5747810 john mccain graduated 894th in a class of 899 at the naval academy at annapolis
5747811 we just finished celebrating our 100th birthday so we understand just how special this is
5747812 centennial cupcake is the perfect ice cream to help commemorate this momentous occasion it has all the ingredients for a celebration cake and ice cream the four leaf clover sprinkles give it that special touch
5747813 4 h is a national organization that benefits so many young people
5747814 our inspiration for the flavor came from the texas organizations 100th birthday but we felt it was important to recognize all 4 h groups
5747815 ive been hearing from lots of families that are asking how can i find a loan because theyve been applying to three lenders and theyve been rejected from all three
5747816 many of the lenders that students may have used last year are no longer in the business
5747817 and your lender may be leaving and give you no notice
5747818 theyre tightening the criteria to get the very best rates and then theyre punishing you even more so when you cant get those
5747819 they want a very good credit history so if you dont have that your best option is to anyone who can cosign for you so you can get a better rate
5747820 every year we get the appeal from some who says i just lost my job or my condo which i thought was valued at x is now valued at y or whatever it might be
5747821 are we hearing more of those i dont know yet but the voices certainly sound a little more desperate
5747822 a lot of these schools are scrambling to try to find a way to keep their student from dropping out because they cant pay the bills
5747823 people that do it on their own very rarely make those decisions at the right time
5747824 its so difficult to pull the trigger when the markets going up and when the markets going down you dont want to pull the trigger and then there you sit with your money still in stocks and tuition bills to pay
5747825 it was a murder with intention he murdered her in anger because she refused to part with the gadget
5747826 we were always worried about students bringing such gadgets to the school
5747827 we have issued several notices and given enough warnings asking them not to bring ipods and cell phones to class
5747828 if i had to bet my life on it id bet it is joe
5747829 barack is moving toward a seasoned beltway type and that probably means biden

5747833 there are a number of simple things to do to save a few dollars on your fuel budget
5747834 all vehicles are different and will experience various levels of savings but there are a few of the basics that work for all types of cars and trucks
5747835 certain types of video games can have beneficial effects improving gamers dexterity as well as their ability to problem solve attributes that have proven useful not only to students but to surgeons
5747836 the big picture is that there are several dimensions in which games have effects
5747837 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5747838 es un hombre humilde que cree en la humildad que es la que nos ha llevado al xito de la eurocopa y en su primer contacto nos ha explicado que es lo que quiere
5747839 se puede crecer de aqu a dos a os el objetivo es el mundial con el nuevo entrenador tenemos dos a os para adaptarnos la base est hecha pero esperamos seguir creciendo porque esta selecci n no ha tocado techo est en nuestras manos la exigencia ahora es otra no vamos a ir de tapados y eso es lo que quer amos tenemos dos a os por delante para seguir creciendo
5747840 la selecci n no solo ha ganado la eurocopa sino tambi n el respeto que antes no ten amos hemos puesto la primera piedra y si seguimos manteniendo el nivel el f tbol espa ol no s lo va a ser campe n de europa sino tambi n campe n del mundo
5747841 everything about the wendy preview clicked for our stations from conception to promotion to hitting the air
5747842 it completely broke the mold the show is now a proven winner and we cant wait to see it debut across the country next year
5747843 doing the daily show for the past six weeks has really been one of the most exciting times in my life
5747844 it has given me the chance to be myself while living out my dream and connecting with my fans on a whole new level

5747850 i recall john telling that story when we first got together in 1971 when were talking about every conceivable thing that had ever happened to us when we were in prison
5747851 most of us had been kept apart or in small groups then in 1970 they moved us into the big cell and when we all got to see each other and talk to each other directly instead of tapping through walls we had 24 hours a day seven days a week to talk to each other and we shared stories i vaguely recall that story being told among other stories
5747852 im pleased to report that ntias efforts are on track with helping the most vulnerable households those that rely exclusively on over the air broadcasts
5747853 however the conclusion to the digital television transition is only six months away so i encourage all households that may need a converter box to apply for coupons now and use them to buy a converter within 90 days
5747854 nationwide with more than 23 million coupons requested and more than 8 2 million redeemed millions of households are now experiencing the benefits of digital tv because of the coupon program
5747855 we will continue to educate consumers about the coupon program and will focus our efforts on those markets and target populations that need the most support
5747856 we dodged a bullet with the storm so thats leading to some selling
5747857 if this storm had happened a couple of weeks ago it would have driven prices higher the momentum of this market is definitely on the downside as people realize that demand is very soft
5747858 especially since there is a clear lack of buying momentum
5747859 we believe that year over year sales trends could worsen given the relative lack of seasonal impact seen so far in august
5747860 when we evaluated virtualization options we felt that vmware offered the most robust and comprehensive platform
5747861 we believe its an ideal platform for our microsoft windows environment one of the particularly compelling capabilities that vmware offers is vmotion it helps ensure application availability during upgrades and whenever alerts pop up it literally helps improve patient care by keeping vital data flowing continuously
5747862 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5747863 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves
5747864 the u s corporate tax system is highly complex and distortionary
5747865 the record breaking snow base at turoa and the great levels at whakapapa will be paradise for skiers and boarders and the good news is that with such large bases we expect to be able to extend the season and potentially keep going into november
5747866 if services are disrupted customers should seek alternative routes if they normally use the jubilee northern and piccadilly lines we expect to operate normal services on the rest of the network
5747867 the reality is that tubelines already pays rates lower than metronet and offers inferior pensions and travel facilities and the reason our members voted by a margin of more than three to one to strike is because what is on the table will widen that gap
5747868 if the law is against you ague the facts if the facts are against you argue the law if both are you against you pound the table

5747873 the implication is that people at risk of macular degeneration could help prevent the disease by consuming antioxidants
5747874 this work by dr vollmer snarr and colleagues ties these two damaging processes together and demonstrates the harm they cause in combination is much more than would be expected
5747875 this new knowledge suggests the possibility of interventions which could prove to be powerful ways to prevent or delay age related macular degeneration
5747876 why not take a page out of one diseases book in the fight against other diseases
5747877 these findings suggest that it is important children first learn how to calculate answers on their own but after that initial phase using calculators is a fine thing to do even for basic multiplication facts
5747878 the study indicates technology such as calculators can help kids who already have a strong foundation in basic skills
5747879 for students who did not know many multiplication facts generating the answers on their own without a calculator was important and helped their performance on subsequent tests
5747880 but for students who already knew some multiplication facts it didnt matter using a calculator to practice neither helped nor harmed them
5747881 teachers struggle with how to give kids immediate feedback which we know speeds the learning process so another use for calculators is allowing students to use them to check the answers they have come up with by themselves giving them immediate feedback and more time for practice
5747882 kids enjoyed them its one way to make memorizing your multiplication facts a more interesting thing to do
5747883 so much of how you teach depends on how you market the material presentation is very important to kids
5747884 many of these students had never used a calculator before so it added a fun aspect to math class for them
5747885 its a good tool that some teachers shy away from because they are worried its going to have negative consequences
5747886 i think that the evidence suggests there are good uses of calculators even in elementary school

5747890 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5747891 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5747892 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5747893 i know that none of us are immune from anything
5747894 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5747895 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that is not going to happen today with this patient
5747896 the mom was playing religious tapes in the room and obviously was very focused on looking for a miracle
5747897 caught her in the side of the head she had no pulse when they pulled her out of the water

5747900 quando fui convidado para fazer o programa ficou a d vida como tem personagem mas n o tenho procurado ser o mais natural exatamente o que sou sou r gido mas quando tem que colocar para cima coloco sou otimista ao extremo tenho uma ponta mas tamb m tenho a outra
5747901 n o tem personagem aqui marco apesar de parecer s rio muito engra ado se calainho foi r gido e eu acho que tenho que ser sou n o tem um equil brio verdade reality
5747902 the program has demonstrated its value many times over in the eight plus years that weve run the program
5747903 over 200 000 in grant monies have been awarded and that has stimulated over 2 million in private sector investment in facade enhancement
5747904 our main street looks really good because over 2 million worth of improvements have been done in the last nine years
5747905 its a really great program and were really glad to be able to assist people
5747906 we assume that a parent after expiration of paid leave in the form of a grant would be able to incur a debt with the commonwealth which provides funds as a partial income replacement for up to six months for each child
5747907 the amount borrowed for one child is assumed to be approximately 14 000 which is the hourly national minimum wage received full time for six months this is doubled for two children
5747908 a cap could be imposed per household to limit the possibility of a large debt on the scheme and the government would determine the size of the cap
5747909 instead of paying employees who take leave employers could receive a subsidy or tax concession
5747910 this will usually entail an architects certificate stating that the conditions of the planning regulations have been complied with
5747911 each year the number of people booking their summer holidays two months or more ahead of the departure date has grown following this trend weve seen an uptake in bookings for holidays in the caribbean and thailand along with other long haul destinations
5747912 this suggests to us that a lot more people are planning ahead and saving up for their holidays somewhere special
5747913 with the lousy weather here people cannot consider getting away from the sun despite the cost we all need cheering up so a holiday is a luxury that has become a necessity for many
5747914 i might not always get the best start i might not always be the fastest person but i just say now if you are going to beat me you are going to have to fight very hard
5747915 i was definitely in control of the race when i got to the 320 mark my right hamstring grabbed on me and i just couldnt move it any more
5747916 there will always be a part and always a very large part of every community that have no care but for themselves and whose care for themselves reaches little further than impatience of immediate pain and eagerness for the nearest good
5747917 men it has been well said think in herds it will be seen that they go mad in herds while they only recover their senses slowly and one by one
5747918 it took a little while to get the plans out and just how we were going to do this
5747919 a year ago we didnt even have the equipment to move to the units
5747920 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hit hard
5747921 my determination remains intact france is resolved to pursue the fight against terrorism for democracy and liberty the cause is just it is the honour of france and its armies to defend it
5747922 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush

5747927 this project has taken several years to plan and so im pleased to see construction work has now started ultimately this scheme will ease traffic congestion in the area and increase public transport capacity for those living nearby
5747928 the scheme has been purposely planned to ensure it is as green as possible not only by using locally sourced materials but by using recycled material like glass which shows there is more benefit to these improvements than just tarmac and clearer roads
5747929 we have all been working very hard over the last year to extend the credit union service to sutton
5747930 with the help of cliff haynes head of sutton housing partnerships income team martin groombridge acting manager of croydon savers credit union sutton council and our other partners we are getting closer and closer to offering real help to families across the borough being hit by the credit crunch
5747931 some lenders charge very high rates of interest whereas the credit union only charge a fraction of this by only lending where it is affordable they can make sure that residents have enough money for essential items such as food rent and heating
5747932 the council are in full support of this initiative our aim is to create a borough in which all can take part and take pride and this includes giving all our residents the chance to get on a firm financial footing
5747933 by pioneering new business models the pc has quietly remained the single leading platform for games not only in terms of consumer usage but revenue generation
5747934 i think its a wholly unnecessary dispute i hope they wont go on strike
5747935 i want tubelines and the rmt to resolve this so we dont have the london travelling public held to ransom for several days over a relatively trivial dispute
5747936 while we think this strike is completely irresponsible we must recognise that this is a situation that must be addressed not only by the rmt and tubelines but by boris johnson as well
5747937 the number of strikes affecting the underground has risen sharply in recent years and it is ordinary commuters that are suffering most we need the rmt tubelines and the mayor to sit down together and look at all available options to avoid future disruption including the possibility of a no strike deal
5747938 boris has made a steady start in his first few months in office but it is on tough issues like this that londoners will look to the mayor to come up with a practical solution
5747939 tfl is responsible for a huge range of transport policies that impinge directly on the lives of londoners and i was delighted when tim parker agreed to take charge of the board on my behalf
5747940 over the last few weeks however it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be taken are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge there are limits therefore to what can be delegated
5747941 i look forward to advising boris on an ongoing basis on transport i have concluded however that it would not be appropriate for an unelected official to chair a body which is responsible for most of the money and a large part of the brief of an elected mayor
5747942 i also agree with the mayor that my position as adviser does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority or the title of first deputy mayor we have therefore decided to adjust the management structure and abolish that position
5747943 so why bring it back now were constantly looking for something thats new but at the same time we have all these people who harp on tradition so its a balancing act
5747944 it came up at one of our committee meetings two or three years ago what if we had a rodeo great idea but then we had to find the right person to partner with whatever expertise we ourselves had long ago went by the by
5747945 the xl algorithm developed by computer scientists at uc san diego significantly outperforms standard link state and distance vector algorithms speeding routing in computer and communications networks
5747946 routing in a static network is trivial say the authors
5747947 being able to adapt to hardware failures is one of the fundamental characteristics of the internet levchenko said
5747948 in this paper we present a new link state routing algorithm called approximate link state xl aimed at increasing routing efficiency by suppressing updates from parts of the network
5747949 in particular recall that the xl routing algorithm propagates all link cost increase updates meaning that on average it will propagate half of all updates that affect it it is natural to ask whether this is strictly necessary or whether a superior algorithm one that selectively suppresses link failures can scale sub linearly for typical networks whether such an algorithm exists and can guarantee soundness and correctness remains an open problem that we hope to address in future work

5747962 wir planen keineswegs fremde territorien zu annektieren unsere friedenskr fte erf llen ihre funktionen gem den vereinbarungen die von allen konfliktparteien einschlie lich georgiens unterzeichnet wurden
5747963 das setzt vor allem voraus dass sich die georgischen truppen in die kasernen zur ckziehen
5747964 der r ckzug der russischen truppen wird sich danach richten wie effektiv georgien seinen verpflichtungen nachgeht und wie schnell standorte der friedenstruppe in der sicherheitszone eingerichtet werden ich glaube das nimmt drei bis vier tage in anspruch

5747992 2007 was another amazing year for autonomy by every measure driven by our strong organic growth and the zantaz acquisition top line revenues operating profits bottom line profit before tax and eps are all up significantly ahead of analyst consensus expectations with strong organic growth and the zantaz acquisition performing well throughout 2007 we consolidated our industry leadership position and finished 2007 as the undisputed leader in pan enterprise search and meaning based computing
5747993 2007 was a transformational year for our markets driven by the fundamental change of the it world to the usage of unstructured information and the secondary drivers of regulatory changes such as the u s federal rules of civil procedure resulting in a convergence of legal and operational information systems this factor is key to most commercial sales the elevation of unstructured information issues to prime time status also drives growth in our oem business where we remain the de facto standard
5747994 we are seeing continuing strength as the momentum of the revolution towards unstructured information gathers pace even the effect of the sub prime crisis appears now to be a positive for our business as our recent 70 million contract with a global bank demonstrated as organizations accelerate their plans in order to be prepared for the consequences engendered by recent events our regulatory compliance and government driven prospects which account for a significant majority of our revenues are robust as are other areas of the business while the current economic conditions bring a degree of uncertainty to any business we have seen no change in trading conditions although we will continue monitor the situation closely as the year unfolds our strong fundamental market dynamics together with a record sales pipeline suggest that we have reasons to be confident in the current outlook for the business
5747995 we have long held that the true essence of knowledge management is an attitude a single minded commitment to improvement companies like autonomy have demonstrated an abiding determination to serve its most important constituency its customers it has also shown agile innovation combined with a full understanding of the forces that affect and will affect its customers
5747996 we are very pleased to acknowledge autonomy for the eighth consecutive year
5747997 we are honored to be recognized once again by kmworld for the unique capabilities that we bring to the knowledge management market

5748001 spearheading the meaning based computing movement autonomy enables proactive organizations like zpid to harness the true value of digitalized information assets
5748002 innovative projects like zpids psychspider search engine unambiguously demonstrate the significance of meaning based technologies for modern scientific research

5748012 now more than ever the u s federal government agencies are challenged with their ability to manage and exploit unstructured information digital information such as emails web pages telephone conversations and videos now represent 80 of the information within government
5748013 autonomy technologies are used by more than 40 government agencies across intelligence defense civilian regulatory and other branches to automatically process unstructured information regardless of format language or location we are honored to receive these awards
5748014 we often hear from teachers students scientists and researchers that they would like to have a single website where they could find research and academic information easily and effectively autonomy will make this a reality and through the technologys automation capabilities we will be able to make this a viable and manageable project
5748015 we look forward to further supporting the swedish research council as it continues to enhance its web portal with more and more advanced features such as the incorporation of more multi media content
5748016 through the acquisitions in 2007 of the archiving specialist zantaz and most recently uk records management specialist meridio autonomy has now demonstrated its differences from the rest of the search and discovery pack
5748017 information access will become increasingly automated with applications initiating the find search discover retrieval process and users being unaware of the activity that has been performed
5748018 the majority of the employees do not either have the time or often the skills training to search efficiently and effectively automated enterprise information access is a major opportunity for improving productivity reducing error and corporate risk
5748019 has potentially the highest market awareness for search and is the first name on most long lists autonomys two 2007 acquisitions give it significant capabilities in the compliance ediscovery field
5748020 this latest ovums research further validates autonomys leadership in providing next generation enterprise information access solutions
5748021 autonomy is the only company that can deliver automatic meaning based computing technologies that allow global organizations to quickly and accurately retrieve both structured and unstructured information from across the enterprise regardless of locations and languages

5748037 motherwell to a certain extent were the surprise team last year and to finish third was a hell of an achievement i want to come here score goals and help us get there again
5748038 if we can improve our away form and continue our home form which was good in the last campaign then we have a good chance of qualifying
5748039 we will not maybe have as much of the ball away from home as we do at windsor park but we must all pull together
5748040 we can start by doing well against scotland and then away to slovakia
5748041 i have never seen as dejected a group of boys as our squad on the way home from iceland but we just have to concentrate on improving as a team

5748043 playing against scotland is almost like a local derby as its easy for the fans to get to and its important that we produce a good performance before the first qualifying game in bratislava on 6 september
5748044 its important we start well in that first match and work as a team which is our strength

5748079 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
5748080 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
5748081 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
5748082 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
5748083 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5748084 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5748085 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5748086 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5748087 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5748088 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5748089 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5748090 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5748091 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5748092 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5748093 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5748094 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5748095 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5748096 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5748097 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5748098 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5748099 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5748100 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5748101 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5748102 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5748103 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5748104 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5748105 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5748106 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5748107 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5748108 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5748109 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5748110 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5748111 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5748112 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5748113 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5748114 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5748115 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5748116 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5748117 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5748118 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5748119 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5748120 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5748121 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5748122 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5748123 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5748124 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5748125 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5748126 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5748127 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5748128 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5748129 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5748130 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5748131 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5748132 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad

5748140 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5748141 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5748142 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5748143 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5748144 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5748145 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5748146 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5748147 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5748148 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5748149 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte

5748179 we are not getting as many guests during this olympic period as everyone expected
5748180 maybe it is because more hotels have opened maybe its because hotels have greatly increased their room rates
5748181 the benefits of the number of people attending the games is expected to be largely offset by reduced business activity during the olympic period

5748260 brasil e argentina s o times muito bons n o existe grande diferen a entre ambos se vencemos com grande diferen a assim como eles em outras oportunidades que aproveitamos o nervosismo do rival

5748591 podr a existir una manipulaci n de estad sticas y de indicadores sensibles como la mortalidad infantil o materna y ante la falta de respuestas de los gobiernos provinciales he solicitado al poder ejecutivo esclarezca la situaci n se estar an violando normas internacionales establecidas por la organizaci n mundial de la salud oms y organizaci n panamericana de la salud ops
5748592 no conozco experiencia m s rotunda donde se haya bajado a la mitad los ndices de mortalidad infantil en cuatro a os
5748593 imitar las metodolog as de medici n y evaluaci n estad stica
5748594 en algunas jurisdicciones como tucum n se observa una disminuci n de la cantidad de nacidos vivos y consecuentemente de las defunciones infantiles con peso al nacer inferior a 1 000 gramos a la vez que se registra un aumento de las defunciones fetales
5748595 llama la atenci n que tucum n registre 158 defunciones fetales con menos de 500 gramos de peso cuando santa fe en el mismo per odo tuvo 86 c rdoba 20 y buenos aires 90
5748596 el m todo usado es anotar como muertes fetales casos de mortalidad infantil
5748597 los que ponemos en peligro el discurso oficial basado en el supuesto descenso de la mortalidad infantil somos desplazados mis informes fueron detallados y evidenciaron las enormes diferencias entre la estad stica oficial y la realidad
5748598 como la tasa de natalidad baj debieron haber descendido las muertes los abortos y las defunciones fetales pero no fue as entre el 2004 y el 2006 la tasa de egreso por abortos comparada con el total de nacimientos subi de un 14 2 a un 18 5 en el mismo per odo el n mero de nacidos vivos de menos de 500 gramos se redujo de 95 a 7
5748599 nacido vivo peso 498 gramos edad gestacional 22 semanas aborto
5748600 nacido vivo peso 476 gramos edad gestacional 20 semanas aborto
5748601 si se volvieran a registrar las muertes de neonatos seg n las normas internacionales y leyes argentinas la mortalidad infantil tucumana crecer a significativamente
5748602 hasta 2004 se mor an 80 beb s prematuros de menos de 500 gramos en toda la provincia en 2006 las muertes infantiles de ni os menores de 500 gramos bajaron a 14 ese mismo a o se registraron oficialmente 360 muertes que representaron un 13 3 por mil si le sumamos las 80 muertes fetales y abortos no registrados como defunciones dar a un total de 440 fallecimientos por lo que mientras la tasa de mortalidad infantil oficial fue de 13 3 por cada mil la real debi alcanzar el 16 2 por mil
5748603 el problema no est en el sistema estad stico sino en el mbito donde se genera la informaci n
5748604 en la argentina nadie se banca los xitos y hemos llevado a cabo una gesti n exitosa en la tarea de reducir la mortalidad neonatal
5748605 en 2004 los jefes de guardia reunieron a todos los identificadores y comunicaron que a partir de ese momento deb amos registrar como nacido muerto a todo beb que pesara menos de 500 gramos
5748606 no practicarle ninguna asistencia m dica se los deposita sobre una bandeja de instrumental hasta que muere

5748786 if you put a plane on a treadmill will it be able to take off

5748798 indias number one davis cupper leander paes informed anil khanna executive vice president and secretary general in a meeting held in beijing just after the tennis event that he would like to step down as captain of the indian davis cup team for the tie against romania
5748799 he wanted the best davis cup team to represent the nation and did not want to leave any doubt in anyones mind for their non participation to represent the country in the biggest team event
5748800 somdev has been picked on the basis of his recent performance leander and mahesh being our best doubles players picked themselves into the squad but rohan has not been selected because prakash and somdev are in better form and are ranked higher than him
5748801 of course rohan is more experienced but somdev is in great form and we thought he would be a better choice current form and performance were the only criteria while selecting the team
5748802 this man has taken the joy away from playing the davis cup
5748803 coach addazio put up a quote that said the strength is the pack and the pack is in the strength
5748804 its kind of an inside thing for the defense were trying to develop a face and a mentality you look at wolves they hunt in packs every time the offense goes against the ones the no 1 offense or the twos we all go out and the first thing we say is we hunt in packs were going out to hunt when the ball is in the air or crosses the line of scrimmage everyone is running to the ball
5748805 it was like we were separate units out there we were just never a defense
5748806 weve got a completely different attitude when were out there
5748807 every single person is taking pride in what theyre doing position groups are getting closer our d line is as close as ive ever seen it the same with the linebackers
5748808 its not like last year when the coaches had to push everyone to get to the ball on defense we pride ourselves on having all 11 people on that frame on the camera right around the ball weve all been picking it up even the big defensive tackles have been running
5748809 i just cant tell you how much of a nine day difference its been from last year
5748810 last year we went through a lot of ups and downs
5748811 we kind of went into a dark room we didnt know what to expect now we know what to expect now and we feel like weve got a lot of experience
5748812 chemistry its conversation and play were doing a lot of things out there that we didnt do last year when a guy makes a mistake were not down on him were not ignoring him either were telling him to get it going and stuff like that a lot of guys on defense last year hadnt played together were comfortable with each other now
5748813 one of our problems was there wasnt enough finger pointing
5748814 guys would ignore guys a guy would mess up and instead of a guy saying come on baby get going he would get ignored it left that guy to question himself because no one was saying anything to him
5748815 its a lot different now theres a lot of conversation going on if you go out there in our huddle all you here is talking its not bickering and stuff like that its positive reinforcement and thats what we need
5748816 we just feel like were going to be a lot better
5748817 we made a lot of mistakes last year and we watched and we learned from them
5748818 weve got some kids who can lead and the others are catching on to that
5748819 they all know hey if johnny doesnt perform im going to step in
5748820 in years past we sort of knew who was going to start right now i cant tell you i have a pretty good idea who has the capability but you never know what might happen

5748824 i cant believe the boss just finished doing all those in that short amount of time if hes so good at it then why didnt we just sit down and he do it to begin with instead of having me doing all that hard work for 3 days for nothing

5749177 i have tried to give women what they say they want but they always want something else women think that what they want is for the man to really talk and to be at home with the kids but she doesnt want that for long she wants a strong man
5749178 we end up relating to women in a way that is more like woman to woman not man to woman we are feminized in our relationships and they dont last

5749195 senator john mccains efforts to restore rural prosperity and improve quality of life
5749196 there are a lot of reasons that i think that this rv tour is gonna fall on deaf ears i think certainly the interests of missourians dont line up with senator obamas campaign and also the values of missourians and rural missourians rural americans they do not cling to religion because theyre bitter they dont cling to their guns because theyre bitter as senator obama has stated they are people of faith and theyre people that want to embrace those second amendment freedoms and the anti second amendment positions of barack obama do not line up with the vast majority of our states citizens and a super majority of rural missourians so i do not believe the rv tour will be successful
5749197 missourians are going to look at the entire package of these two candidates
5749198 and so were having some growing pains here in the state of missouri with corn based ethanol and i think a lot of other parts of the country are too we have never said corn based ethanol is the answer weve always said that it should be a part of the mix i think technology over time may change some of that
5749199 i certainly hope and i expect to see senator mcain in outstate missouri but our people out here are trying to get informed right now and i think the more theyre informed theyre going to like where john mccain stands on issues
5749200 he intends to be here a great deal campaigning all across the state and we want him to do that because his positions resonate with rural missourians
5749201 i dont know that its all that effective for barack obama for example to go to lebanon and explain to people why hes against drilling for oil within the united states when were in the midst of an energy crisis
5749202 everyone is complying with the strike our regions need to recover these resources

5749584 sometimes you can mark him but sometimes you cant its what happens with players with great individual quality
5749585 it was normal ronaldinho couldnt play in these olympics at the level everyone is used to seeing from him
5749586 without a doubt he was an example for the team on and off the field he will still contribute a lot for the national team
5749587 the 28 year old ronaldinho who struggled with injuries at barcelona got to play only because he negotiated his release before transferring to ac milan countries are allowed to include only three players older than 23 in the olympics
5749588 this is the most beautiful moment in my life a real dream

5749609 in the past six years nick and i have led the company in its growth into a leading wireless value added services and wireless media company in china
5749610 i am very proud of what we have achieved and this success simply would not have been possible without a team of talented experienced and dedicated management personnel and employees and the steady support and guidance we received from the board however i believe this is the right moment for me to transition to a less active role with the company in order to spend more time with my family and on other personal interests which i have not been able to do in light of my daily responsibilities at the company
5749611 on behalf of the company i would like to express deep appreciation for the leadership dedication and vision that yunfan my co founder has brought to this remarkable enterprise during his tenure as kongzhongs ceo yunfan has helped us achieve important milestones of good management and strategic positioning we are confident about the future of both our wireless value added services and our wireless internet business and are delighted that yunfan will stay on as the chairman of our board i will work with the board our management team and all of our employees to ensure a successful smooth leadership transition and maintain continuity in the relationships we have all worked hard to cultivate with telecommunications operators and our customers

5749620 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5749621 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5749622 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5749623 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5749624 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5749625 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5749626 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5749627 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5749628 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5749629 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5749630 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5749631 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5749632 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5749633 ill be 18 in three months and i can do it anyway
5749634 i would say the message is we were disappointed with our performance at e3
5749635 there were titles like wario which we think will be really fun titles that we should have showcased
5749636 we were excited that mr miyamoto made the commitment that pikmin is coming it would have been nice if we could have said that on stage but we think it was a good recognition for us that we care for our core fans and not just the new people who are now discovering nintendo
5749637 theres a lot of people put a lot of work into this development and im really pleased for everyone involved especially the supporters that weve managed to complete the stadium
5749638 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
5749639 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
5749640 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
5749641 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
5749642 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5749643 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5749644 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5749645 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5749646 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5749647 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5749648 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5749649 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5749650 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5749651 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5749652 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5749653 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5749654 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5749655 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5749656 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5749657 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5749658 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5749659 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5749660 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5749661 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5749662 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5749663 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5749664 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5749665 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5749666 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5749667 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5749668 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5749669 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5749670 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5749671 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5749672 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5749673 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5749674 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5749675 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5749676 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5749677 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5749678 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5749679 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5749680 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5749681 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5749682 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5749683 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5749684 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5749685 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5749686 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5749687 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5749688 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5749689 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5749690 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5749691 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5749692 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5749693 weve got to hope for the best i dont know what were going to do without her
5749694 i would have to see her in a wheelchair before i believe she wouldnt play
5749695 theres no way we should lose to belarus no offence if you win the quarter final the rest is gravy
5749696 hes brought china out of nowhere he was my mentor the best coach i ever had
5749697 we have all seen what the chinese have done it has been fantastic but i am not intimidated by that we can have a show that is equally as fantastic without wasting money
5749698 i am not convinced that there arent still some sensible savings we can make without remotely prejudicing our ability to deliver a fantastic games
5749699 this was a project an olympic games that was won secured commissioned at a time of economic plenty were being asked to deliver it in a credit crunch and with what people say is a recession looming
5749700 the international olympic committee understands that we are not going to produce an austerity games we are not going to run the thing down but we are going to deliver value for money

5749707 they didnt really say anything that new but they kind of reminded us that were not out of the woods yet on the financial sector
5749708 we will come in on budget and we will not waste taxpayers money
5749709 within the overall ceiling of 9 325bn theres no more money
5749710 if we have to find more money for a particular aspect of the programme then savings will have to be affected elsewhere and everybody involved in the programme understands that
5749711 we cant muster quite as many people as the chinese but i want people to know that i dont think anybody on the london olympic team is remotely intimidated by what the chinese have done
5749712 wonderful though it is we are going to put on something just as fine
5749713 we will be ready we will come in on budget and we will not waste taxpayers money

5749755 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5749756 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5749757 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5749758 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5749759 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5749760 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
