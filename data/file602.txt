6020000 theres a very empowering process that goes on when cancer becomes something you can write about its not just this thing thats invaded you
6020001 the danger to the individual i suppose is that some people could expose themselves more than they maybe want to
6020002 but i think the danger is more in the potential misinformation
6020003 it really causes you in the midst of having the rug pulled out from under you to think about what you want to say and what you want people to hear
6020004 the first version was probably my own cathartic dumping out of all my own feelings
6020005 and i remember realizing i could edit it a little bit and still get out some of those feelings without overwhelming people but also letting people know it was really tough
6020006 its been great for me because when youre sick its tough to reach out to your friends individually
6020007 with this you write one message and people respond with all these really beautiful things its really uplifting
6020008 when you get cancer youve descended into a foreign country where you dont know the language and you dont know how to get around
6020009 and one of the ways you learn to do that is being able to talk to people who are members of this world
6020010 after a while you become more interested in the experience of the cancer than in the science of the cancer
6020011 you start to move past what the disease is and you start to wonder what the disease will be like
6020012 in case there were others out there who wanted to know about the experience of cancer
6020013 i realized about four or five months into it that i had become part of this greater blogging community
6020014 its not that im stuck in the past and im not willing to move on
6020015 ive just come to accept that breast cancer in some way shape or form will always be a part of my everyday life

6020035 it is extremely disappointing to see that sinn fein are not supporting community relations they have shown their true colours in this statement they have no real intention of tackling segregation in our society
6020036 for a long time alliance has been calling for the divisions in our society to be removed given that 1 billion is wasted every year on maintaining a segregated society
6020037 can you please pull up my order invoice and tell me what it says
6020038 okay i see it here you got the chaise lounge in the ivory
6020039 no thats what i bought what i got is a chaise lounge in beige
6020040 oh okay i see here the guy who sold you the chair typed in ivory as the description of the color but he typed in the number for beige
6020041 well id like to get the ivory one delivered then
6020042 it comes in black sage honey and beige but no ivory
6020043 well thats really irritating because i was sold an ivory chaise
6020044 i mean the guy offered it to me in that color its not like i just made it up
6020045 i heard that but thats what you sold me so thats a big problem
6020046 no i want the chair i plunked down my credit card to buy
6020047 but the man who placed this order hes um well hes foreign
6020048 you think that being foreign makes someone laughably color blind
6020049 it means that only a legitimate blind person would mistake beige for ivory
6020050 i know you didnt cause this but youre the one whos going to fix it
6020051 so it means you basically stole from me you sold me a product that doesnt exist and now here i am with a chair the exact same color as my beige walls my beige carpet and let me tell you this chair has become the invisible jet of chairs because in this room wonder womans the only person who can find it to sit in it
6020052 sir we can exchange the chair for you if you will simply choose between black sage honey or or beige
6020053 the only compromise i would be willing to accept at this point is getting a black chair
6020054 well have it delivered tomorrow but youre getting the one off the showroom floor

6020057 many people who would never throw for instance a plastic bag on the ground would go ahead and toss a cigarette butt on the ground and step on it and leave it there

6020063 it is still possible that this is a coincidence but we wanted to make sure that thats not the case so weve asked for a different group of experts to come in and review the whole thing again and just see whether we missed anything
6020064 its an infection that entered through the umbilicus but it is unusual to have two very severe infections this close together thats why we want to make sure that we have an international expert like dr louie pull the team together and make sure were doing everything we can
6020065 there were three young lads in the car amazingly they came out without a scratch the driver walked away
6020066 the noise was incredible they hit a lamppost and carried on into three walls
6020067 my neighbours wall completely shattered and a brick came crashing through my front window luckily i was upstairs asleep
6020068 the first complaint i made about the road was in 1982 when a young bride was killed by a speeding car
6020069 we were on to the council then we had a petition about the danger of the road but nothing has been done
6020070 only a couple of weeks ago there was another smash where a speeding car wrecked five parked vehicles they go too fast along this road
6020071 if youre a driver youre not going to hit them quickly at the moment people are driving too fast down the road and then swerving to avoid parked cars
6020072 police were called at 8 08pm on sunday night to the irish centre in high street digbeth following reports of shots being fired
6020073 two people sustained gunshot wounds and were taken to hospital a man was shot in the stomach and is currently in a stable condition
6020074 a woman was shot in the arm and has received medical treatment their ages are unknown at this stage the scene is cordoned off whilst enquiries take place
6020075 when they told me people had been shot here last night i was stunned but then this type of thing seems to be happening a lot more these days
6020076 ah poor ronnie i was only speaking to him 10 days ago he was going to help me out on a mexican music project that im working on and because hes good at spanish he agreed to do a bit of the translation on a few songs for me
6020077 sadly that didnt happen the memories of ronnie go back a long way long before the beard let me tell ya memories galore
6020078 one that sticks with me is the time we were in copenhagen many years ago we were in this fine restaurant for the best part of the afternoon and ronnie had had a few drinks
6020079 he was in a funny mood a bit under the weather shall we say he staggered outside to the front lawn of this fancy place and lay on the grass after a while we heard this siren in the background and saw an ambulance approaching and ronnie said ah the poor devil i wonder who thats for
6020080 then the men in white coats took ronnie by the arms and lead him into the back of the ambulance and took him to hospital the doctor examined him and told him to get dressed
6020081 the two came out to the waiting room where i was sitting and the doctor said that he couldnt find anything wrong only that ronnie had consumed too much alcohol
6020082 with that ronnie said in his rasp dublin brogue in the name of jaysus i could have told you that in the first place that was his wicked sense of humour
6020083 i could have been one of the dubliners myself when ronnie barney and ciaran first got together after a gig in the gate theatre they wanted me in but of course i had other ideas the chieftains in other words
6020084 they really were brilliant days back then at odonoghues and the roundwood always a real family feeling between us all the craic was good
6020085 ronnie was a very intellectual person into his history and very well read he had a wealth of knowledge about a whole host of subjects
6020086 dubliners loved him everybody did he was a wonderful man wholl be sadly sadly missed by many its the end of an era
6020087 to me its a great personal loss and for music its a massive loss
6020088 i grew up with the music of the dubliners ronnie was at the forefront of folk traditional music along with the clancy brothers he is an iconic figure and a perfect gentleman he was a typical dub a poet and a storyteller that would keep you spellbound i dedicated sundays show to ronnie and played dubliners songs all day it was magic
6020089 obviously its a sad time for ireland i was a big fan although i never met the big man he epitomised ireland and dublin in particular he was a true dub a real character with that unmistakable accent its a sad loss for the country
6020090 he was one of the great irish characters we worked together in monte carlo about eight or nine years ago hell be sadly missed i offer my deepest condolences to his family at this sad time
6020091 ronnie drew personified ireland and everything irish he was a tremendous player and singer that low deep voice was totally unforgettable my dad knew him very well i take my hat off to what he has done for irish music its a tremendous loss
6020092 having grown up in co wicklow where traditional irish music is very strong i certainly knew all about the dubliners the older i got the more the dubliners music featured in my life and the more you listen the more the songs stuck with you the very first song i learned was the famous seven drunken nights but no one sang it like ronnie he was a larger than life character with a voice to match
6020093 ronnie has left his earthly tour for one of the heavens they need him up there its a little too quiet and pious god is lonely for a voice louder than his own
6020094 weddings funerals bar mitzvahs thats what i loved about ronnie drews voice and spirit music to inspire to console an optimism that was contagious thats what u2 took from the dubliners
6020095 it was my privilege to meet one of the legends of irish music and one of irelands great adverts his presence was as engaging as his voice
6020096 ronnie drew was an iconic figure in irish music over the last five decades i met him and admired his music his unique singing voice was loved by so many people
6020097 ronnie whether as part of the dubliners or during his solo career will also be remembered for his promotion of irish music both at home and around the world
6020098 he bore his illness with bravery and will be sadly missed
6020099 when you mention dublin you mention ronnie drew the two just went together everybody loved him
6020100 he was an absolutely unique character a one off he had a wonderful sense of humour very sharp wit a great man to put down a heckler in the audience its been a privilege and a great pleasure to work with the man over all those years
6020101 it is with great sadness that i have learned of the death of the great irish singer ronnie drew
6020102 ronnie was a champion of traditional irish music and with the dubliners he re energised and refreshed our unique musical heritage he brought great pleasure to the people of ireland and yet more around the world ronnie will be greatly missed by many but most particularly by his family with whom our thoughts are with
6020103 i went to the front and stayed there but to keep these guys at bay is not easy
6020104 with 150m to go i thought i had it and then a bit of a monkey jumped on my back if you lose concentration and miss one stroke these guys get half a boat length on you and at this level it is impossible to make that up
6020105 i was good enough to win for 900m not a thousand that was my problem
6020106 i had two world champions one olympic champion a junior world champion and another olympic silver medallist in my heat with three to go through to the final having said that i rate myself as one of them and i came her to win which makes it disappointing
6020107 but the positive is that i have shown that i have the speed for the 500m semis and that is very encouraging
6020108 i know i have the speed i know i have the guts all i have to do is put it all together i am disappointed now but hopefully that will fuel me for my 500m semi final
6020109 i got splashed by the starting shoe dropping and i missed two strokes at the start but after that i got into a really good rhythm

6020225 you look at one of our goals were going to find out how tough he is
6020226 he does a bit of everything he can win the ball distribute it well a good range of creative passing and he has a hell of a shot on him
6020227 he likes to shoot as well and he has the potential to score plenty of goals from midfield either with a long range shot or bursting into the box to score with his feet or from a header
6020228 a partir de ahora estados unidos y polonia estar n seguros
6020229 de esta forma completamos las negociaciones que fueron duras pero siempre amistosas porque estadounidenses y polacos somos amigos
6020230 clubs like liverpool are always looking round the world for players and there is always going to be someone new challenging you
6020231 it was sudden one day i was a liverpool player the next i was going to leave
6020232 i just wanted to make sure i got the best possible club there was no way i was going to be comfortable playing for another english club and i had plenty of offers from other clubs in the premier league
6020233 i didnt have to leave because i had another year left but i did want to be playing regularly and i didnt feel that would happen this season if i stayed
6020234 i spent seven years at liverpool and played more than 250 games the challenge in italy was the right one for my career and the time was right to change to another country
6020235 of course there are problems between the owners and the manager but hopefully they can resolve those problems and settle down
6020236 he is a fantastic player and a fantastic signing for the club
6020237 i knew he was a liverpool fan from his childhood and this is the best move of all those he has had in his career he could be the reason liverpool will challenge for a title
6020238 over the last couple of years his work rate has really improved and he is difficult to mark because he is always on the move
6020239 a piece of history in a most unlikely and almost forgotten place
6020240 they chelsea didnt win the premier league last year ive been in that position where youve not win it youre hungry and determined and you want to win it simple as that
6020241 weve got to match their determination their hunger and desire weve got players at the club whove tasted success over the last couple of years and want more
6020242 were all disappointed we didnt win every team wants to get off to a winning start but we did okay carlos tevez was not there on sunday and wayne rooney missed a bit of pre season

6020259 whats with your father is he full of crap or what
6020260 oh thank god because he told me im having a girl and i really want a boy
6020261 oh no wait okay yes hes full of it with everything else he says but not with guessing the gender of babies in the womb both of my kids are girls and both ultrasounds for them came back as boys and my father kept telling me not to buy boys clothes because they were girls and in the end he was right ive been watching him guess the gender for over 20 years now and he has never been wrong once nor has he ever refused to make a guess to someone hes always right
6020262 you got a girl in there i see her in there a girl for sure and a real cute one too

6020268 the desire to have children and the ability to be a good parent are not exclusive of heterosexuals homosexuals can be amazing parents
6020269 steve but many homosexual couples want children and they do have them and raise them
6020270 gays bond in happy stable homes they do have children
6020271 but they cant have children without the intervention of science
6020272 im curious why would homosexuals even want children if they arent even drawn to the opposite sex
6020273 no it is not what has the fact that you prefere the opposite sex to do with the instinct of having children and or passing on your genetic material
6020274 i dont agree but if that is what you want to spend your money on have fun
6020275 if god has created all men equal why are homosexuals less equal if god created men would god not be a little homosexual
6020276 the church is a body that follows the teachings of jesus christ clearly homosexuality is not part of that
6020277 i can assure you that the are specific references in the bible that clearly speaks against homosexuality
6020278 why would anyone make the choice to deviate from society and face ridicule if a homosexual couple wants to have a child using science or adopt then they should go for it because its their choice to say its wrong for a gay or lesbian couple to do so would be like me going to do the same and them saying that native american women are not allowed that would be wrong
6020279 my only question is can a homosexual couple give a child the male amp female love that i believe a child needs to develop
6020280 if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it does it make a sound
6020281 what point do you imagine you make by saying there are

6020283 surely you cant deny that the percentage of homosexuals have risen within the past um lets just say 100years
6020284 deny that the percentage of homosexuals has risen with the past um lets just say 100 years
6020285 the only thing i want is to make sure that when i have kids they wont think it is normal for two men or two women to be together i beleive in tolerance but i do not appreciate being told that i must accept something when it is against my beleifs

6020469 we came to in the second half and then we could have scored three or four
6020470 with only one goal from two games and that from the penalty spot we clearly need to up the scoring rate
6020471 it gives an opportunity to other lads to try and keep their place in the first team
6020472 having new faces in the team will also disrupt their preparation
6020473 today we were able to carry out more set up work on the rc212v which we still dont completely know

6020475 is it real is it real did i really win gold
6020476 i wanted to make china proud in the olympics that china is hosting
6020477 in the first leg i felt the gold was already in my pocket because i was first and the chinese girl was behind
6020478 in the end i turned around on the last leg and realized that maybe spain had given up
6020479 later sensini joked that the silver medal completed her olympic collection

6020487 dat zou betekenen dat we veel geld daarvoor moeten uittrekken dat je uit de verkoop nooit kan terugverdienen
6020488 het is nog geen uitgewerkt bouwplan we willen eerst van de gemeente weten of ze zich kunnen vinden in de uitgezette koers als dat zo is dan kunnen we verder
6020489 de gemeente wil graag een bepaald cultuurhistorisch niveau maar als dat betekent dat we maar twee verdiepingen mogen bouwen dan wordt het heel moeilijk we werken nu al op de grens van economische haalbaarheid mooiste lezersfotos in de bieb

6020560 there will be a lot of differences with the second album
6020561 first of all its just more personal im involved in every aspect of the writing as far as the direction of the music its very different i wanted this album to have something that was a little bit of rock a little bit of r amp b and a little bit of pop
6020562 im a dancer and when i perform live i love to dance so i have to make sure it has that nice kicking bass the pop sound is to make it a little bit more now and when it comes to the rock it makes it very live feeling very instrumental i listen to a lot of music like classic rock alternative hip hop classical jazz whatever so im very musical and like to be able to incorporate that into my music as well

6020573 human development is the best dividend of democracy hence our resolve to pay more attention to youth and women empowerment in view of their position in the scheme of things

6020614 as far as humans go if you want to form a colony on mars or establish a station youd want to dig a well and pump liquid up from the surface
6020615 our job is to figure out if this ice has melted and gone through a liquid phase

6020657 he jones has his opinion i have mine and mine is the one that counts i have to see it with my own eyes but there are no easy games in this league
6020658 i wanted to play for things again and i cannot wait to get started
6020659 i knew i would have to take a step back to take a step forward
6020660 it was my choice but i knew i could eventually get back up again and here i am now at a huge club like celtic they are in the champions league and wanted to deal quickly
6020661 theres a big squad and i have been trying to get into the team
6020662 we have spoken about it but i dont think i will say too much more
6020663 clubs like liverpool are always looking round the world for players and there is always going to be someone new challenging you
6020664 it was sudden one day i was a liverpool player the next i was going to leave
6020665 i just wanted to make sure i got the best possible club there was no way i was going to be comfortable playing for another english club and i had plenty of offers from other clubs in the premier league
6020666 i didnt have to leave because i had another year left but i did want to be playing regularly and i didnt feel that would happen this season if i stayed
6020667 i spent seven years at liverpool and played more than 250 games the challenge in italy was the right one for my career and the time was right to change to another country
6020668 of course there are problems between the owners and the manager but hopefully they can resolve those problems and settle down
6020669 he is a fantastic player and a fantastic signing for the club
6020670 i knew he was a liverpool fan from his childhood and this is the best move of all those he has had in his career he could be the reason liverpool will challenge for a title
6020671 over the last couple of years his work rate has really improved and he is difficult to mark because he is always on the move
6020672 he is a good link up player and a very very good finisher inside the box he is a smart intelligent player and playing behind fernando torres could be very crucial
6020673 i wouldn t be surprised if he did have it
6020674 earlier this month ortiz 15 6 1 announced that he had reached a deal with affliction a long term deal that he claimed would make him the highest paid fighter in mma
6020675 i dont know if were really negotiating or simply helping tito stroke his giant ego
6020676 i would rather have bleeding hemroids than fight for the ufc

6020686 it was all so completely unexpected i was called into the office at our training ground and told theyd received an e mail from george burley to the effect that if i could show i had scottish blood in me there was a good chance i would be called up
6020687 i was always aware my grandmother had been born in dundee
6020688 my old man used to take me to scotland to see that side of the family but i never thought it would come to pass
6020689 i was straight into the loft at home digging out the birth certificates to prove i had a scottish connection
6020690 ive never played international football at any level but id love to grab this chance to play for scotland
6020691 im not looking to set off fireworks and have people saying weve been missing that guy for years but id relish the opportunity tonight to show i belong in the squad
6020692 there are a lot of good strong players in this side and it would be great if i could establish myself as being in the reckoning
6020693 it would be great to be part of the world cup qualifying squad but this is the start of a journey i never thought i would be making
6020694 whether it stops after tonight or carries on to next months games well have to wait and see but it is something i am relishing and hopefully i have done enough in training and can do enough should i get the chance to play for whatever time tonight to show george burley i am capable of playing international football
6020695 normally you would reckon youd have enjoyed a run of games playing well and perhaps scoring a few goals then you might get this sort of recognition but i had only played one game for derby when scotland got in touch
6020696 now i know there could be someone in the stand watching me every week although having just moved to a new club im trying to impress everyone in every game it has been a fantastic start to the season an absolute whirlwind

6020701 weve got to look beyond david in the next year or so hes 38 and hes done absolutely magnificently
6020702 gary caldwell has come in with stephen mcmanus and has done great
6020703 but before i announced the squad i spoke to david and told him he was very much in my plans for the world cup but i didnt feel it was right bringing him in and sitting him on the bench hes got a family down south but as soon as gary got injured i had no hesitation in bringing david in
6020704 you need more than two centre halves and were fortunate that david is still fit and playing for rangers so hell be a vital part of the squad he wants to play if he plays against macedonia hes in pole position for the next one and thats what competition is all about caldwell and mcmanus would have been playing but garys injured and david will be playing
6020705 i think a lot of the lads were proud of what we achieved after the italy game
6020706 i know it sounds horrendous being proud after failing to qualify but it was the manner we went about our business
6020707 at the start of the campaign nobody gave us a hope but the fans the country the press everybody got behind the team and it was amazing
6020708 unless you are actually playing in it you cant describe the feeling of having the whole country behind you playing for one of the old firm youve got one half of the city that no matter what happens gets behind you and the other half are looking to slaughter you but when im playing for my country ive only ever felt everybody getting behind me and what a buzz it gives you the scotland fans are tremendous
6020709 a couple of folk have said to me what a great group youve got but you look at it and say not really we are going to macedonia and norway who do well and weve got iceland and holland so its a very tough group
6020710 it shows how far weve come that people are now expecting us to qualify
6020711 if we lose the game we arent going to lose confidence going into the world cup qualifiers
6020712 i have to keep working to support my family its not an option to stop
6020713 its always difficult working away from home but i cant wait around for the doctors to find out whats wrong with me i need to keep working
6020714 i know it sounds crazy and a lot of people will criticise me for it but i have to pay the bills at the end of the day and if i do face cancer i need to make sure i can support the boys
6020715 hes over in his office moving his pieces around the board hes one step ahead of everyone else and only he knows where hes going
6020716 ive worn this uniform for thirty three years its who i am its what i am a soldier for you to tell me that can go out across this country and recruit young men and women to wear this uniform then send them to war in this uniform and send some of them home in body bags wearing this uniform but that i cant wear it here in the communities of this country to encourage americans thats something i just cant come to grips with

6020752 reinventing a legend is never easy but that is exactly what fiat has achieved with its new 500
6020753 so what makes the fiat so special in a similar vein to the mini the 500 manages to capture the spirit of a legend without coming across as forced or tacky its low prices go hand in hand with the great looking exterior and interior styling to create an irresistible package
6020754 and the worst news for rivals is that this is only the beginning for the 500 there are technical innovations such as an ultra efficient two cylinder engine waiting in the wings while the abarth sporting brand will bring hot hatch performance to the fiat at the end of the year looking further ahead the italian firm will also launch an estate version to rival the mini clubman as well as a 500 convertible by keeping the style and spirit of the original but adding refinement versatility and luxury fiat has built a car that we will be talking about for decades to come just like its predecessor
6020755 this is yet another example of the fans the fiat 500 is winning among the uks leading commentators and journalists and i am delighted to say that that same confidence in the product is being shown by customers too
6020756 to date we have sold or taken orders for more than 11 000 fiat 500s in the uk and there are a lot more to come yet we are delighted with auto expresss choice of best city car for 2008 and look forward to many more important awards like this one for the 500

6020763 hes a lot more forward than he was first up last prep and this race looks a very good starting point for him
6020764 he had over a year off last time with injury but this time hes only been off since may and he should be running on nicely
6020765 i feel very secure with all the stables i ride for including johns oshea
6020766 ive been putting in a lot of track riding for tim martin guy walter and john oshea probably more than ever and its paying off

6020845 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6020846 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6020847 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6020848 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6020849 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6020850 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6020851 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6020852 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6020853 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6020854 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6020855 this is a planning took where all things are going
6020856 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6020857 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6020858 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6020859 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6020860 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6020861 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6020862 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6020863 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6020864 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6020865 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6020866 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6020867 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6020868 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6020869 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6020870 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6020871 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6020872 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6020873 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6020874 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6020875 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6020876 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6020877 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6020878 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6020879 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6020880 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6020881 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6020882 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6020883 indivizii care nu isi pot stapani emotiile nu vor putea profita de investitiile lor
6020884 nu conteaza daca multimea este de acord cu tine sau nu tu ai dreptatea pentru ca datele si motivele tale sunt corecte
6020885 o oportunitate de a cumpara intelept cand preturile scad puternic si de a vinde destept cand se poate obtine un profit bun
6020886 this isnt just a renaming of edgar its a fundamental change in the way the sec collects distributes and manages information
6020887 idea is the secs new technology framework to make analysis faster better and cheaper for investors
6020888 not only would we be looking after the students of argentina by helping them learn english but the local community here in foxford would also benefit i hope that we can make jjs project a reality in the years ahead
6020889 jjs shoes can never be filled but we cannot let his dream die either we have to pick ourselves up and get to work on the objectives that he had outlined at the civic reception in june the admiral brown park in foxford and the language school are obviously the main priorities and hopefully more local people will come on board to assist in these initiatives
6020890 superstition ought not to be confounded with religion however much their history may be interwoven nor magic however white it may be with a legitimate religious rite
6020891 the e meter has no proven usefulness in the diagnosis treatment or prevention of any disease nor is it medically or scientifically capable of improving any bodily function
6020892 having been commissioned of jesus christ i baptize you for and in behalf of full name of deceased person who is dead in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost amen
6020893 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
6020894 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
6020895 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
6020896 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6020897 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6020898 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6020899 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6020900 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6020901 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6020902 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6020903 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6020904 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6020905 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6020906 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6020907 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6020908 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6020909 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6020910 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6020911 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6020912 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6020913 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6020914 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6020915 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6020916 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6020917 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6020918 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6020919 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6020920 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
6020921 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
6020922 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
6020923 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
6020924 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
6020925 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
6020926 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
6020927 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
6020928 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
6020929 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
6020930 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
6020931 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
6020932 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
6020933 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
6020934 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
6020935 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
6020936 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
6020937 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
6020938 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
6020939 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
6020940 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
6020941 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
6020942 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
6020943 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
6020944 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6020945 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6020946 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6020947 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6020948 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6020949 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6020950 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6020951 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6020952 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6020953 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6020954 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6020955 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6020956 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6020957 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6020958 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
6020959 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
6020960 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
6020961 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
6020962 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
6020963 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
6020964 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
6020965 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
6020966 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
6020967 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
6020968 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
6020969 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
6020970 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6020971 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6020972 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6020973 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6020974 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6020975 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6020976 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6020977 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6020978 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6020979 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
6020980 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
6020981 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
6020982 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
6020983 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
6020984 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
6020985 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
6020986 it is increasingly apparent that the traditional newspaper model is under pressure
6020987 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6020988 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6020989 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6020990 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6020991 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6020992 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6020993 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6020994 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6020995 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6020996 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6020997 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6020998 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6020999 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6021000 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6021001 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6021002 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6021003 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6021004 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6021005 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6021006 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6021007 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6021008 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6021009 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6021010 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6021011 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6021012 warren felt that since that was basically asking for a commitment he felt that it was fair to tell them in advance that he was going to ask them that
6021013 unfortunately for the democrat party the poor are beginning to wake up that the liberals they have always looked to are behind the war on the poor
6021014 by war on the poor i refer to the movement by the anti oil extremists to close off every good domestic oil resource which is a direct cause of the high energy prices americans face
6021015 seems that there are more than a couple of folks taking notice of your postings tom excellent job i believe cleveland is better off because of the job you did
6021016 tom blumer at bizzyblog brings actual facts about coal miner fatalities to light and gives the bdsers a reality check
6021017 the best blogger in the state and a more talented natural economist than any of those pointy headed keynesian halfwits
6021018 tom blumer is doing stuff that msnbc and ap should have done before providing the teenager farris hassan a national international forum and 15 minutes of fame
6021019 guys like tom blumer cover what really matters and theyre independent enough to tell the truth without fear of aggravating corporate media owners
6021020 bizzyblog made my point with numbers and facts and stuff

6021025 the ioc was very clear in the lead up we would work in concert with all the anti doping bodies

6021035 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender

6021040 oh this is interesting someguyiveneverheardof com is reporting presumptive democratic nominee barack obama has lady parts obviously scurrilous and unfounded well examine it tonight in our special barack obamas vagina the october surprise in his pants
6021041 its the only way to find out whats really going on
6021042 hopefully the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill
6021043 in some respects the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most potential energy so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion the most interest i dont mean for the audience i mean for us
6021044 would be very unpleasant for most people to watch its really a gathering of curmudgeons expressing frustration and upset and the rest of the day is spent trying to repress that through whatever creative devices we can find
6021045 they have used fringe scientists and fake experts to muddy scientific debates on global warming stem cell research evolution and other matters
6021046 the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe
6021047 dr thaksin shinawatra to help communicate his vision and aspirations for the club
6021048 my experience is exactly the opposite and id rather make a judgment based on my experience than some theoretical hypothesis my job is that i run a commercial organisation so i dont deliberately do things that are bad for it commercially i might make a judgment error but so far we are the number one in the uk so we must be doing something right
6021049 listen im an agent not a principal if people think someone is a dictator then thats his problem and not mine i believe that everybody is entitled to their advocate i would never ask anybody here to do something which they were morally or ethically opposed to when we did a job for the norwegian government on whaling a number of people didnt want to work on it and i said they didnt have to
6021050 or try not to would probably be a more honest way of putting it
6021051 because im clearly a conservative and take the conservative whip in the house of lords everybody assumes that i run my business on the basis of being a conservative which is absolute rubbish
6021052 there are people here who represent the labour party the liberal democrats the green party
6021053 i do travel a lot i probably go more to the middle east than anywhere else i go to washington a lot and to various places in eastern europe and the occasional trip to south america
6021054 sky really began that process what sky did was introduce the concept of consumer empowerment
6021055 i would find it very hard to give good advice
6021056 she is a symbol of the hatred of the left
6021057 no because im older but i love my job and it has got better not worse i think ive got better at it because ive got more experience and because its more interesting now dealing with the mobile phone and the internet is a really interesting challenge and has had a real structural effect on our industry
6021058 i have to embrace digital technology because it would be stupid for me not to its not easy because im old and all the faces in the digital world are young but theres an inbuilt assumption that people who are young use the internet and people that are old dont its not true
6021059 our experience is that whatever the turbulence in the stock market whatever is being said about gloom and doom in the economy its not showing up in our figures
6021060 although people are having difficulties over credit and so on they are still using communications to talk to people about it whereas in the last downturn they said its a nightmare im not going to say a thing until its over
6021061 unfortunately a large number of people in our industry are not in it because they want a career and they want to understand how it works they just want a job they want to work for the least number of hours for the most amount of money our industry is populated by a lot of people who really arent very interested in what they do
6021062 on the other hand our role has become more important and people at the top of the business are contributing a hell of a lot more than they used to theyre invited to the top table because the discussion about how you are going to communicate something is almost as important as what youre going to communicate
6021063 the people i least enjoy working with are the people who really do take themselves seriously it makes relationships so difficult
6021064 im a great subscriber to winston churchills saying that the only original remark is something that hasnt been said for some time
6021065 marshall mcluhans great theory that its the medium not the message is actually not true

6021070 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo

6021072 did you see that logo on the side of the pitch during the champions league final last night how cool was that

6021074 die zahl der lehrstellensuchen in nieder sterreich ist stark gesunken so gab es bei uns ganz im gegensatz zu aktuellen bundeszahlen im juli um fast 22 prozent weniger als im vergleichsmonat des vorjahres
6021075 generell ist arbeitslosigkeit unter jugendlichen in nieder sterreich im selben vergleichszeitraum um 9 6 prozent stark zur ckgegangen
6021076 die positiven zahlen verstehen wir als klaren auftrag diese aktive n besch ftigungspolitik fortzuf hren damit wir auch in zukunft arbeitspl tze f r unsere nieder sterreicherinnen und nieder sterreich absichern so entwickeln wir bereits neue besch ftigungsprojekte insbesondere f r jugendliche langzeitarbeitslose und ltere arbeitslose sowie f r frauen um drohenden gewitterwolken am konjunkturhimmel entgegen zu wirken

6021078 its a new era after 42 years as a weekly press gazette goes monthly
6021079 a multiplatform approach where breaking news blogs discussion strands and all the other attributes of a website sit alongside a print partner which needs to take the time and have the space to develop explain comment and analyse the major themes of our profession
6021080 if your mums a loser your morals are lacking and you look like the back end of a bus your family is going to be non the richer sic when your future husband comes knocking

6021084 as jeremy vine once found while chairing a press conference
6021085 we know its silly season but were a bit worried that tatler has lost the plot
6021086 for a start it has a huge article on uber wag alex curran then another piece thats all about knocking the royals for being naff
6021087 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper
6021088 the us is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would go further to say the worst is yet to come
6021089 pointy head who doesnt know when to keep his mouth shut
6021090 the 90 minute drama will interweave the stories of three very different women and shed light on the impact and influence the books had on womens lives over the last century
6021091 i think its partly because the books are cheap they are considered disposable literature and theyre also almost exclusively read and written by women and so have never been taken seriously
6021092 lets stand up for tv talking about the positives and all the great stuff
6021093 originally the term sentimental was used to describe poets who engage with feelings as well as the mind and if that is the way it is being used then yes burns was sentimental but in the modern sense it means treacly or sugary and that is not the real burns at all i think paxman is trying to trade off his image as a grumpy middle aged man it is very strange he is saying this its the equivalent of poking a stick in jocks ribs which is fine if he really wants to do that
6021094 who cares what he thinks of burns paxman is a short man with a long face
6021095 i am very sure that he knows he is being controversial
6021096 we knew he would say something interesting and it will certainly get people talking
6021097 its not exactly a word one hears every day but as a term to describe dog tiredness it has a pleasing euphony
6021098 although im afraid i find the scottish national poet no more than a king of sentimental doggerel one might as well have used his ramfeezled to describe our state
6021099 im controversial in a thoroughly establishment kind of tradition sorry i cant help it im the establishments anti establishment
6021100 sta bene con te sta bene con me sta bene quando piove
6021101 die angehenden restrukturierungsexperten krisen und insolvenzberater oder sanierungsmanager sind f r die wirtschaft mittlerweile unverzichtbar es besteht hoher bedarf bei unternehmensberatungen wirtschaftstreuhand gesellschaften im bankensektor oder auch im ffentlichen dienst
6021102 ein unternehmen zu sanieren ist eine anspruchsvolle aufgabe in einem meist schwierigen umfeld eine akademische ausbildung berufserfahrung und f hrungsqualit t sind daher zwingend erforderlich
6021103 im wirtschaftsleben geraten unternehmen oft sehr schnell in eine krise und damit verbunden in restrukturierungsphasen ein interim oder turnaround manager muss neben speziellem betriebswirtschaftlichen und rechtlichen fachwissen vor allem kommunizieren k nnen
6021104 many americans are wondering when their priorities will finally be in the wrong place again
6021105 we saw what the onion was doing in the us
6021106 it was really smart and really funny and we did not think there was anything like it in britain which left a huge gap in the market for us to fill with abuse innuendo and smut
6021107 still a loss making enterprise and desperately needs outside support if it is to keep going
6021108 revenue is already big enough to pay salaries for neil and me and we can now afford to pay a couple of freelance writers as well the beauty of the internet is that it allows people like us to set up a business at low cost and low risk our cost of content generation is very low versus normal content providers we pull in smaller ad revenue than an equivalent circulation paper product but dont spend it on paper distribution phones cars and big offices we dont have to employ our own sales team and pay them if they dont perform we employ an outside sales team on a pure commission basis
6021109 its a very harsh and competitive environment if we werent funny the site would just die on its arse
6021110 china was last night congratulated for its adoption of western values after banning an ugly child from appearing on television
6021111 she also looked a bit retarded and you cant really show that sort of thing on primetime tv
6021112 yang has voice of angel but face of shane macgowan from pogues we use her and world think china land of ugly troll not hot asian babe so instead we get cute girl to mime to yangs lovely voice she honk like peking duck but beautiful like china doll
6021113 but in a different environment we are writing commentary but in a joke form the most frequent comment you see about us on the internet is that we have really nailed an issue
6021114 modern television satire is very soft and newspapers are terrified that they will alienate readers we did not start with an audience to lose so were not scared

6021179 die zahl der lehrstellensuchenden ist im vergleich zum vorjahr um 9 3 prozent gesunken und die lehrstellenl cke betrug im juli 5 089 eine entwicklung die auch die gewerkschaftsjugend zur kenntnis nehmen sollte

6021193 it is defensive and is not aimed at anyone it is nonetheless a system that establishes firmly again and reaffirms our cooperation and relationship with poland
6021194 it will deepen our defence cooperation and it will deepen our ability to deal with threats

6021207 education is at the heart of successful interventions to improve public health this new resource aims to raise awareness and understanding of hpv and cervical cancer within a broader sexual health context and empower young people to take informed action to protect their health
6021208 the thirst for information is overwhelming over 50 000 copies of the societys general information leaflet have been requested and it is predicted that nearly half of all secondary schools across the uk will be directly reached by the teaching and learning resource
6021209 immunisation and vaccination provide an essential tool in improving public health and the introduction of the hpv vaccination programme is a hugely significant step however success requires an investment not just in vaccine delivery but also in the health promotion measures necessary to create a supportive educational and organisational environment education is not an add on but a pre requisite
6021210 this is an excellent example of collaboration between a charity and the private sector which has very much been in the public interest we have also ensured close consultation with the public sector all in all this is a high quality resource to meet a high public demand for information
6021211 since 9 11 the nrc has upgraded security requirements including rewriting our regulations such that the enhanced requirements that we put into place after 9 11 will apply to any new reactors that might be licensed and built
6021212 we also have put in place requirements at existing reactors where the plant has to have procedures and resources in place to effectively deal with the effects of explosions and large fires from any source on their premises
6021213 there is no doubt that such an event will cause a lot of industrial damage at the site but our analyses show that even that amount of damage does not lead to a high likelihood of anything reaching the environment from the reactor core
6021214 low cost energy will be an economic boom to this area like this place has never seen before
6021215 we are unable to produce a vast majority of crops we have land that went fallow
6021216 what do you need to clean water heat and electricity whats more abundant at a power plant than heat and electricity
6021217 so many of the companies that were dealing with now in the state of virginia are panicking because they need so much talent not only additional talent for the new work they got but also the retiring workforce
6021218 whats happened over the years is a lot of nuclear engineering programs have basically been done away with
6021219 obviously the change now is that its a very clean energy so with the global warming issues the interest in nuclear energy is really picked up a lot
6021220 students want good jobs i think theyll probably be good paying jobs and so i think that is really what will make it work
6021221 the financing team did a fantastic job selling our bonds considering the volatility of the market
6021222 plus the strong underlying ratings helped tremendously with attracting buyers for our bonds and lowering our borrowing costs
6021223 we found that if a teacher has a high achieving group of students pushing them harder by giving them more homework could be beneficial
6021224 similarly if a teacher has a low ability class assigning more homework may help since they may not have been pushed hard enough but for the average achieving classes who may have been given too much homework in an attempt to equate them with the high achieving classes educators could be better served by using other methods to improve student achievement given these students abilities and time constraints learning by doing may be a more effective tool for improvement
6021225 there has been an extensive amount of research examining the influences of students achievement but it has been primarily focused on financial inputs such as class size or teachers credentials
6021226 our study examined the affect that additional homework has on test scores
6021227 this does not mean that homework is unimportant for average achievers
6021228 but it does mean that this population may also benefit from other activities such as sports art or music rather than additional hours of math homework
6021229 in my own personal experience i see that each semester requires a different approach
6021230 this is even true when i teach the same course twice in a semester different times of the day or lengths of classes require different methods just as different quality students require different approaches
6021231 teachers should consider quality over quantity when it comes to homework assignments
6021232 in the end it should be up to the individual teacher to decide how to motivate and educate their students
6021233 one of the most beautiful things about america to me is the creativity that we instill in our primary and secondary schools
6021234 i know that we lag behind many countries in test scores but i believe we also produce some of the most creative enthusiastic students in the world
6021235 there are two directions you can go with this research
6021236 some might say this suggests that parents should have their kids attend places of worship or if we use it to help explain why religious participation has a positive effect on academics parents who arent interested in attending church can consider how to structure their kids time to allow access to the same beneficial social networks and opportunities religious institutions provide
6021237 for typical teens in the study the probability of dropping out of high school for those who attend religious services and youth activities at least once a week is 05
6021238 for teens who never attend services the probability is 084 over 60 percent greater
6021239 we know roughly half of american teens regularly participate in some kind of religious organization
6021240 so its important to understand what aspects of religious involvement can benefit adolescents in order to enhance their school success during a difficult but critical period of development
6021241 surprisingly the importance of religion to teens had very little impact on their educational outcomes
6021242 that suggests that the act of attending church the structure and the social aspects associated with it could be more important to educational outcomes than the actual religion

6021245 our fall semester will heavily focus on the elections but we wanted to begin with an update on iraq arguably the most important issue of the campaign
6021246 well focus on lessons we have learned and where we go from here
6021247 the american culture of war a history of american military force from world war ii to operation iraqi freedom
6021248 the weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths
6021249 in essence the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch
6021250 ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe acute secondary bacterial pneumonia
6021251 clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities
6021252 we are encouraged by the fact that pandemic planners are already considering and implementing some of these actions

6021259 gaming the vote why elections arent fair and what we can do about it
6021260 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6021261 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
6021262 were very pleased that the court recognized that the mbtas legal arguments were meritless
6021263 the mbtas attempts to silence these students were not only misguided but blatantly unconstitutional
6021264 the judge today correctly found that it was unlikely that the cfaa would apply to security researchers giving an academic talk
6021265 a presentation at a security conference is not some sort of computer intrusion its protected speech and vital to the free flow of information about computer security vulnerabilities silencing researchers does not improve security the vulnerability was there before the students discovered it and would remain in place regardless of whether the students publicly discussed it or not
6021266 the only thing keeping the students and the mbta from working together cooperatively to resolve the fare payment card security issues is the lawsuit itself
6021267 the mbta would be far better off focusing on improving the mbtas fare payment security instead of pursuing needless litigation

6021343 this year the multinational record labels will only release about 40 records by brazilian artists while tecnobrega artists will release around 400
6021344 the record industry argues if intellectual property isnt protected there will be no innovation but tecnobrega has shown thats not true
6021345 piracy in brazil is undermining the ability of the music and film industries to invest in the next generation of local talent lower revenues from current sales mean less money to invest in new artists

6021369 am avut discutii inca de acum doua luni cu dansa am fost la dansa in vizita in harghita si i am propus sa candideze pentru functia de deputat de neamt in momentul de fata doamna mona musca a acceptat sa fie nominalizata pentru camera deputatilor si va candida numai intr un colegiu la neamt
6021370 ma bucur foarte mult ca a acceptat propunerea si sunt convins ca va obtine un scor foarte bun asteptam decizia conducerii partidului care sa aprobe candidatura peste doua saptamani
6021371 mona musca are intentia de a redeschide in septembrie acel proces personal cred ca ea a platit cu varf si indesat o greseala facuta in tinerete s a retras din viata politica si eu cred ca orice om are dreptul la o a doua sansa mai ales ca este vorba de mona musca si stim cu totii ce a facut dumneaei pentru romania in toata aceasta perioada
6021372 sper ca mona musca va reflecta si va trece peste nedreptatea care i s a facut peste suferinta care a indurat o in aceasta perioada si va avea curajul sa ia o decizie pozitiva pentru a reveni in politica in momentul in care ea va avea o hotarare pozitiva sper sa gasim si in pd l resursele de intelegere pentru ca aceasta decizie sa fie intampinata cu simpatie
6021373 doamna mona musca figureaza printre propunerile venite din judetul neamt personal cred ca nu avem niciun obstacol si niciun motiv sa refuzam candidatura doamnei mona musca asteptam ca si mona musca sa si manifeste dorinta in acest sens prin organizatia prin care a fost propusa

6021393 americas reputation as an international leader rests in the hands of our youth and it should be among our top priorities to provide our students with the tools they need to maintain and build upon this standing the national center will help future american workers compete in the global marketplace
6021394 the national center couldnt come at a more critical time
6021395 american businesses know that they need a well educated workforce to face growing competition from china india and europe americans need to constantly upgrade their skills to keep pace with technology and international competition and people who are losing their jobs often need to acquire new skills to rejoin the workforce
6021396 this initiative is built on historical precedents once each century during a time of national crisis our country has made a transformative investment in education the northwest ordinance brought public education in the 18th century the land grant colleges act brought public higher education in the 19th century and the gi bill of the 20th century creating the national center will bring learning and skills training into the 21st century

6021417 although we noted both ads clearly stated includes tesco products on promotion we considered that that disclaimer did not go far enough to remove the implication given by the headline claims that tesco was generally cheaper than either of their competitors
6021418 nor did we consider that it explained adequately to consumers that the savings were representative of a comparison between promotional prices and everyday prices and could only be achieved for a limited time they were therefore not representative of the savings consumers could generally expect from tesco
6021419 tesco explained that the ads were not intended to represent a shopping basket survey to demonstrate a typical and representative selection of consumer goods or illustrate a comprehensive survey of prices

6021422 the longer fiji is burdened with an authoritarian government lacking in constitutional and legal legitimacy the greater will be our national decline
6021423 i therefore entreat the forum leaders to use all the diplomatic political and moral authority at your disposal to bring fiji back to respectability and legality
6021424 the people of fiji will owe the forum a lasting debt of gratitude if it can prevail upon commodore voreqe bainimarama and his regime to stand by their nukualofa obligation there is no reason whatsoever why an election cannot be held by march 2009
6021425 have widened our ethnic divisions created bitterness and alienation and inflicted much suffering on the people
6021426 they have been hurt through job losses shrinking incomes and widening poverty there have been countless abuses of human rights and constitutional freedoms cronyism and nepotism have reached unprecedented heights
6021427 from the forums perspective the fiji situation represents a real challenge
6021428 never in the history of the forum has a member country reneged on an assurance freely given to the island leaders
6021429 the shame of this for fiji is that under the leadership of ratu sir kamisese mara we were instrumental in the founding of the forum it was his vision that provided the initial guiding influence

6021474 eine sachgerechte bewertung der verwendeten rohstoffe und technologien setzt voraus dass alle biokraftstoffe ob aus europa oder aus s damerika nach denselben objektiven kriterien beurteilt werden

6021480 ich habe k nstlerisch auf die entwicklung des neuen pekinger olympiastadions einfluss genommen aber von anfang an gesagt dass ich mit den olympischen spielen nichts zu tun habe ich habe dann selbstzweifel gehabt denn die spiele sind nat rlich eine gro e chance f r china ich dachte ich bertreibe mit meinen bedenken aber bei der er ffnungsfeier fand ich alles viel schlimmer als erwartet
6021481 die spiele sollten eine party sein aber sie sind es nicht sie sind nur eine party f r die partei diese party hat keinen traum ihr fehlt die musik es ist nur eine party von der wir wissen dass sie stattfindet zu der wir aber nicht eingeladen sind am 23 august werde ich in peking ein konzert geben um zu feiern dass die spiele vorbei sind
6021482 aber sonst bin ich sehr pessimistisch vor allem aufgrund der umweltpolitischen erfahrung mit den spielen wir hatten sieben jahre zeit peking umweltgerechter zu gestalten es gab daf r ein versprechen der f hrung und ein hohe ffentliche aufmerksamkeit und nichts wurde erreicht am ende schaltete man die fabriken f r zwei monate aus und lie weniger autos auf die stra en was bedeutet dass nachher alles wie vorher sein wird das ist eine echte katastrophe

6021487 i am not a policeman we do not enforce that all we do is pass the law
6021488 disappointment that our bishops conference recently could not agree on a collegial response to the governments legislation on same sex adoption
6021489 attempting to arrive at a consensus among bishops with sometimes divergent views episcopal conference statements and documents have a tendency to be often flat and safe at a time when we need passionate and courageous public statements that dare to speak the full truth in love
6021490 i must admit that during my 15 years as a bishop i have increasingly come to share certain concerns about the relationship between individual bishops and the national conference
6021491 reluctance among the rest of the bishops to speak out on these issues
6021492 results often in the loss of the scandal and the folly of the gospel so that we are no longer the salt and leaven so urgently needed
6021493 confident courageous and prophetic bishops are vital for the well being of the church during this time of increasingly aggressive secularism
6021494 the passion to serve the lord is noticeably absent in many cases there seems to be at times a tiredness and reticence to preach the gospel
6021495 doctrinal and moral teaching in their collaboration with secular agencies
6021496 im thinking in particular of agencies with a responsibility for education or economic development the staff of these agencies are often in a position to witness to the truth of the churchs teaching on say the theology of the body with its positive refutation of pre marital sex safe sex or artificial birth control in their dealings with government departments and committees
6021497 there must be no back peddling on these issues just because certain truths are unwelcome in the corridors of power
6021498 we have talked too much and done too little we have witnessed over the past forty years a growing crisis in the catholic understanding or self identity of the church have we forgotten what it is to be catholic
6021499 the maturity of the pope john paul ii generation will lead i hope to a resurgence of orthodox committed adults in the church gradually renewing vocations to the priesthood religious life and marriage

6021502 apple today responded to statements reported by japans meti regarding batteries in the first generation ipod nanos apple has determined that in very rare cases batteries in first generation ipod nanos sold between sept 2005 and dec 2006 can overheat causing failure and deformation of the ipod nano
6021503 apple has received very few reports of such incidents less than 0 001 percent of first generation ipod nano units which have been traced back to a single battery supplier there have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage and no reports of incidents for any other ipod nano model
6021504 any first generation ipod nano customers who have experienced their battery overheating should contact applecare for a replacement
6021505 we believe a female was involved in this but weve not made an arrest
6021506 we have also written to all those mps and senators who had spoken in parliament in support of the inclusion of maltese children in the new law when it was being enacted in 2006 and early 2007
6021507 we are still hopeful that there is the political will under the new government in canberra to make the required amendment to the act so that approximately 3 000 children born in malta with australian born parents will then have a direct route to australian citizenship

6021538 ill sit here and say we have to qualify for the world cup and nothing more simple as that

6021541 lets forget all that stuff lets concentrate on qualifying for the world cup in two years time it is in the hands of the players to do that
6021542 weve got the manager and the players to move forward but lets not focus on winning anything we just need to qualify for this world cup and have to concentrate on that
6021543 in the short of space of time weve had with the manager he has stressed about having less anxiety and more confidence and weve done that

6021565 this big push is making people crazy thinking theyre bad moms if they dont get their kids vaccinated
6021566 merck lobbied every opinion leader womens group medical society politicians and went directly to the people it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now
6021567 i would have liked to see it go much slower
6021568 in that time you learn a lot about safety and side effects and how to use it
6021569 those getting it early should be the ones who really want it and willing to accept the risk
6021570 you can only study a vaccine for so long before you license and use it in a population where it has enormous value
6021571 our hope and belief is that this is a remarkable vaccine that will have huge impact on women
6021572 this kind of money could be better used to solve so many other problems in womens health
6021573 some of our provinces are running out of money to provide primary care im not against vaccines but in canada and the u s women are not dying in the streets of cervical cancer
6021574 this initiative was seen as a good use of resources that fits with the governments health priorities and political priorities
6021575 if we do this quickly and badly we could cause more deaths
6021576 when you get a letter saying this is what you need to do to protect your girls of course you do it
6021577 i chose to get vaccinated because my dreams dont include cervical cancer

6021586 her parents are scientists they know better than to assume gardasil caused her disease
6021587 you inevitably find adverse events that you wouldnt have suspected
6021588 cervical cancer is a worthwhile disease to prevent in a country that has the resources

6021612 our policy is in line with the international practice of encouraging adoption by families within the country
6021613 but that does not mean we have any prejudice against foreign adoptions

6021617 i read your spider article here in the united states and wondered if this spider is possibly from either the steatoda or theridiidae species aka fake black widow just a thought since black widows are not common over there
6021618 unfortunately the photo is not sufficiently sharp to give a positive id the spider is not a black widow but is possibly a steatoda or false black widow they are poisonous as are all spiders but they are not dangerous
6021619 this may well be lactrodecus geometricus the brown widow spider which are found in uk and now believed to be more common

6021810 now more of the species that are found in warmer climates are occurring but that change is not occurring as fast as the change in temperature is
6021811 some species have changed their range hugely over the past two decades

6021849 its a process we might not go out there on wednesday and win 6 0 and have everyone saying we can be world champions we have to be realistic and build on our confidence

6022038 gunakanlah lima sebelum tibanya lima iaitu gunakan masa mudamu sebelum masa tuamu masa sihatmu sebelum masa sakitmu masa kayamu sebelum masa miskinmu masa lapangmu sebelum masa sibukmu dan masa hidupmu sebelum masa matimu
6022039 sesungguhnya telah datang kepada manusia suatu masa ketika itu dia belum ada sesuatu apa pun yang dapat disebut
6022040 apabila mati seseorang hamba maka terputuslah amalannya kecuali dari tiga sedekah yang jariyah terus menerus manfaatnya ataupun anak yang soleh mendoakan baginya ataupun ilmu yang dimanfaatkan sesudah itu
6022041 apabila kamu bersembahyang keatas si mati hendaklah kamu mengikhlaskan doa kepadanya
6022042 salam sejahtera keatas kamu wahai penghuni kubur dari kaum mukminin dan muslimin dan kamu insya allah akan mengikuti kamu kami memohon keselamatan untuk kami dan kamu juga
6022043 sesiapa yang mati tidak sempat menqadhakan puasanya hendaklah keluarganya walinya menggantikan puasa tersebut
6022044 allah yang mengambil jiwa manusia ketika wafatnya dan ketika tidurnya sebelum wafat lalu ditahan nya jiwa yang telah wafat serta dilepaskan nya jiwa yang lain sampai kejanji yang ditentukan
6022045 tiga perkara yang mengiringi jenazah iaitu keluarganya hartanya dan amalannya maka dua perkara akan kembali dan yang kekal hanya satu sahaja iaitu keluarga dan hartanya akan pulang danyang tinggal hanyalah amalannya sahaja
6022046 wahai jiwa yang tenang tenteram kembalilah kepada tuhanmu dalam keadaan redha dan diredhai maka masuklah kedalam golongan hamba hambaku dan masuklah kedalam syurga
6022047 barangsiapa yang membuat perbuatan baik sebesar atom akan dilihat nya dan barangsiapa yang membuat perbuatan jahat sebesar atom akan dilihat nya juga
6022048 walai manusia sesungguhnya engkau mesti bekerja keras dengan bersungguh sungguh menuju kepada tuhanmu yang akan engkau menemui nya
6022049 jika kamu bertelingkah pendapat pada sesuatu maka kembalilah dia kepada allah dan rasul jika kamu beriman kepada allah dan hari akhirat kerana itulah yang lebih baik dan lebih bagus kesudahannya
6022050 dan ketika tuhanmu menjadi keturunan anak anak dari punggungmu dan tuhan mengambil kesaksian dari mereka kata nya bukankah aku ini tuhan kamu mereka menjawab ya kamu menjadi saksi
6022051 maka hadapkanlah wajahmu kepada agama dengan betul ciptaan tuhan yang telah menjadikan manusia sesuai dengan agama itu tiada pertukaran bagi ciptaan tuhan itu
6022052 wahai manusia kalau kamu masih ragu tentang hari kebangkitan maka ketahuilah bahawa kamilah yang mencipta kamu dari tanah kemudian dari setitik air mani
6022053 dan ketika kamu mengatakan hai musa kami tidak akan percaya kepada kamu sehingga kami melihat allah secara terang terang lalu kerana itu kamu disambar petir sedangkan kamu ada melihatnya
6022054 sesungguhnya kami telah menjadikan manusia dari sari ranah kemudian kami jadikan dari tanah itu air mani yang tersimpan didalam tempat simpanan yang teguh
6022055 dan tuhan mengeluarkan kamu dari perut perut ibu kamu sedangkan kamu tiada mengetahui apa pun lalu dijadikan bagi kamu pendengaran penglihatan dan hati moga moga kamu berterima kasih
6022056 katakanlah bahawa malaikat maut yang telah diserahi perkara kamu akan mewafatkan kamu kemudian itu kamu akan kembali pada tuhan kamu
6022057 sesungguhnya orang orang yang mendustakan keterangan kami dan memandang rendah terhadapnya tidak akan dibukakan pintu pintu langit kepada mereka
6022058 diatas orang yang berpengetahuan itu ada lagi yang maha tahu
6022059 dan diantara kamu ada yang disampaikan allah kepada usia tua bangka supaya dia tiada ketahui lagi sesuatu yang dahulunya dia katahui
6022060 orang orang yang beriman itu akan menjadi tenteram hati mereka ingatlah dengan mengingati allah itu hati akan menjadi tenteram
6022061 tiadalah terjadi sesuatu bencana itu melainkan dengan kehendak allah dan siapa yang percaya kepada allah nescaya dipimpin allah hatinya
6022062 kalau tiada kerana kemurahan dan rahmat allah kepada kamu nescaya tiada seorang pun diantara kamu yang suci buat selama lamanya
6022063 syaitan itu menjanjikan kemiskinan kepada kamu dari menyuruh kamu mengerjakan perbuatan yang keji
6022064 hanyasanya allah akan menerima amalan itu daripada orang orang yang bertakwa
6022065 jika engkau membaca al quran maka mohonlah perlindungan allah daripada syaitan yang terkutuk
6022066 dan kalau syaitan orang jahat membisikkan kepada engkau sesuatu kejahatan maka berlindunglah kepada allah sesungguhnya dia itu maha mendengar lagi maha mengetahui
6022067 mereka bersumpah kami hanya mengkehendaki niat baik dan taufik mereka itulah orang orang yang diketahui allah akan isi hati mereka
6022068 dan katakanlah tuhanku aku berlindung diri kepada engkau daripada bisikan syaitan dan aku berlindung diri kepada engkau tuhanku supaya mereka tiada mendekatiku
6022069 dan janganlah engkau menjadikan tanganmu terbelenggu ketengkukmu dan jangan pula bentangkannya seluas luasnya sehingga engkau duduk tercela dan sensara
6022070 dan mereka yang apabila membelanjakan hartanya melampaui batas dan tiada pula bersifat kikir tetapi pertengahan antara keduanya
6022071 sesungguhnya manusia itu dicipta sentiasa gelisah jika disinggung bahaya dia berkeluh kesah dan jika disinggung kebaikan dia kikir pula
6022072 dan ketahuilah bahawasanya allah mengetahui apa yang didalam hatimu sebab itu berhati hatilah dengan tuhan
6022073 dan kenanglah kurnia kepada kamu dan ingatlah perjanjian yang telah kamu ikat dengan dia ketika kamu mengatakan kami dengar dan kami taat
6022074 dan kalau engkau tanya mereka siapakah yang menciptakan langit dan bumi dan menjadikan matahari dan bulan nescaya mereka akan mentakan allah jadi bagaimana pula kamu berputar dari kebenaran
6022075 sesungguhnya kami telah menciptakan kamu kemudian kami bentuk rupa kamu kemudian kami katakan kepada malaikat sujudlah kepada adam

6022097 ubuntu has a huge user base and substantial community support around the world we think the passion these users have for linux and the open source movement generally will be important in helping the linux foundation to accelerate the uptake of linux in organizations of all size
6022098 so it seemed logical for us to join the other major vendors supporting the linux foundation at this time
6022099 even though canonical and ubuntu have been participating in our activities for the last few years the direct association with them means well have closer coordination across their organization it also means they see enough value in what we do to financially support it
6022100 for the consumer at the end of the day what really matters is what can i do with the phone
6022101 if android allows you to do things you cant do otherwise and its better then consumers will start to say i know what this is and i want it thats going to be hard to get to that point
6022102 to me the key variable is really not so much android its your big mobile phone operators that command most of the market share and how are they going to act and react
6022103 i think the idea behind android is a good one the idea of having an open platform but at the same time phones are different from computers most people dont realize their phone has an os on it much less care about what os it has
6022104 really the success of a platform boils down to the developers
6022105 when youre sitting at zero handsets developers have to make their bets
6022106 one would think that google with their very broad reach and very good branding would be at lots of advantages with respect to distribution their open nature might mean they have a pretty good rev share model in place for the developers
6022107 i think a lot of the developers are betting that its worth playing with the android platform
6022108 it may as well be the only phone in the world if youre google youve got to match that and if not do better be cheaper one or the other
6022109 the site is currently not available due to technical problems

6022113 20 08 2008 one day after israeli prime minister ehud olmert warned
6022114 the moment the lebanese government confers legitimacy on hezbollah it must understand that the entire lebanese state will be a target in the same way that all of israel is a target for hezbollah
6022115 during the second lebanese war we considered the possibility of attacking lebanons infrastructure but we never resorted to this option because we thought at the time that all the lebanese were not responsible for the hezbollah attacks
6022116 the moment hezbollah takes control of the lebanese government we will have to address the consequences
6022117 the right of lebanon its people its army and its resistance to liberate its land

6022122 we raised money in q2 that we needed to enhance our working capital position allowing us to build new products at an accelerated rate as a result growth for our company is increasing at a significant rate and our backlog orders are higher than in any period in the companys history
6022123 we primarily relied on our previous efforts in achieving record sales growth for the first half of 2008 customers find us based on our reputation in the market of being able to deliver products customized to fit their needs the financing we brought in during the second quarter of 2008 has better prepared us for an expected surge in production and we expect that it will help us improve profitability in the second half of this year
6022124 our projections for the latter half of 2008 are of continued record growth and we expect our current growth rate to continue well beyond that

6022149 when we show our model researchers embrace it its taken a group think approach in a positive way for open source development in the medical field
6022150 a combination of two things is driving the open source movement in the medical field one is a growing interest in research collaboration the other is that a level of software sophistication to enhance medical collaboration is not there yet

6022161 the flora and fauna around us are shifting over time due to climate change
6022162 the result is desynchronisation if birds and the insects on which they depend do not react in the same way we are headed for an upheaval in the interaction between species
6022163 at any one site the community of birds you find there has changed over time
6022164 now more of the species that are found in warmer climates are occurring but that change is not occurring as fast as the change in temperature is
6022165 some species have changed their range hugely over the past two decades
6022166 for example the buzzard one of our biggest birds of prey 20 years ago was restricted to the west of britain but has now spread as far east as london

6022375 finance ministry was putting ifs and buts but prime minister said there should be timely payment of subsidy as it is a matter related to farmers i thank prime minister for his personal intervention
6022376 when i joined the subsidy was rs 13 000 crore which has now increased to rs 1 19 000 crore but in last four years not a single penny burden has been imposed on farmers as there was no increase in prices of fertilisers

6022385 its a good teen read and tells them a lot about human nature and social issues
6022386 it the book is listed under the category of humor
6022387 but im not entirely sure it fit there its a bittersweet mixture
6022388 they the seniors reminded me of the golden girls they had funny things to add and talked to the girls about what life was like for them

6022406 to discover the essence of sin we must begin with the biblical concept of missing the mark chatha and hamartia these hebrew and greek terms indicate that the human situation is fundamentally that of failure we are sinners ultimately in that we miss the mark we fail to live in accordance with the destiny and design god intends for us 187
6022407 do not think this way do not act this way
6022408 sin likewise affects the way we view creation around us as we see nature having value only insofar as it serves us 188
6022409 the problem of sin is not merely external to us but it is a radical problem it goes to the core of our being 188
6022410 supernatural sorrow must wean the soul from sin and turn it to god 5
6022411 sorrow must in other words work repentance for to repent is to change 5
6022412 for the kind of sorrow god wants us to experience leads us away from sin and results in salvation
6022413 gradually the knowledge of sins real nature the secret disorder wrought by sin and the ruin and desolation that sin brings into the soul unfold themselves to the mind 9
6022414 with so many players playing their first game at this level and against a big strong polish team who are experienced under 21 internationals i thought we performed very well
6022415 it is a learning curve for our lads and between now and next september they will grow and develop at this level and there is enough ability to do well
6022416 i think that showed what kind of character i am to the manager to bounce back like i did after that huge disappointment for myself maybe that persuaded him
6022417 the first thing rio did was turn to me and shake my hand and thats a measure of the kind of guy he is
6022418 i think especially rio whos been in great form at manchester united and what hes achieved in the last few years has been unbelievable
6022419 hes an example and we can all learn from that its a great honour for me to have those kind of players in the squad
6022420 like a team with spirit and without fear with big personality this is very important to me i want to see this the most i want to see another step forward we have to arrive at the next game ready
6022421 this represents a fair approach to funding such an important national event
6022422 ive scored three from three games in the league so far and thats all you can strive for as a striker
6022423 unfortunately weve lost those three games havent performed and that is something that must be sorted out we feel as though our season has started
6022424 now though i want to concentrate only on doing well for northern ireland and i suppose this game is something of a relief for me i take it as a great honour to be involved with northern ireland and im not really bothered if its a friendly or qualifier i want to start every game
6022425 i moved away from scunthorpe primarily because of what i want to achieve with the northern ireland team and now its a case of getting on the pitch and scoring goals i do it at club and would dearly love to start scoring for northern ireland
6022426 we would love to hear from her about coming on to the show theres no reason why she couldnt appear as a celebrity in dictionary corner
6022427 maybe its time we had a chat about how he feels about treacle tart
6022428 lets be brave and actually stay over the night to see what he she is like in the morning
6022429 last year i had the dr hook hits and history and that went really well and at the start of the year i had the bill wymans rhythm kings and i am now getting fan mail from people who had never got the chance to see me perform before so that is really cool
6022430 ever since the hook days they really seem to be loyal fans i always get a great deal fan mail before and after the show which is great
6022431 but the most important thing is what they think of me they keep coming back to see me and i always get a good crowd
6022432 i am doing something that i love so i am really lucky and i will just keep doing it until i cant do it anymore
6022433 i am not a big party lover i dont drink or do drugs i am in good shape everywhere i go to i walk so i will keep doing this as long as people want to come and see me
6022434 its not an easy choice because rio ferdinand is a very important player and i like him as a captain
6022435 hes very good but i chose john because i think we need one captain with a big personality in every moment
6022436 i think its very important to know a lot of players as captain its very important
6022437 after i know the players i choose because one player told me this is good and others said it wasnt i had to know the players
6022438 it offers a new channel for the protesters to better express their opinions by attracting the attention of tourists reporters and officials during the games
6022439 had been withdrawn after amicable settlements between the parties and authorities
6022440 two other applications have been suspended due to incomplete procedures in one case the applicant wanted to involve children in the demonstration this is against the law
6022441 i would love to have seen some of those amicable settlements
6022442 we snatched a bag and ran away but i was arrested
6022443 hes an important player for us he has proved that over the years
6022444 but like the manager george burley says we have got very good players to come in if there is one position in the squad that you can afford to lose somebody it would be in the midfield scott brown is there as well
6022445 its great you can call on someone like davie weir
6022446 he has bags of experience and its always a pleasure to play beside him its important we get a good win and its also important we get a good performance going into the two big games
6022447 it all kicks off in a couple of weeks time in macedonia so we will be looking for a good performance
6022448 i havent changed my mind i want to join everton
6022449 we are still in contact i hope now that rennes will accept to enter into negotiations with this english club i dont want to let this chance go by
6022450 its disappointing but you have to be careful with hamstring injuries
6022451 we dont want a repeat of last season when shefki kuqi joined us and suffered a hamstring injury in his first game
6022452 andy comes to us with considerable premier league experience for a player of his age he is another valuable addition to tony pulis squad
6022453 if we do not apply our beliefs about god to the issues of everyday life the vision god has given us will never be fulfilled the only way to be obedient to the heavenly vision is to give our utmost for his highest our best for his glory this can be accomplished only when we make a determination to continually remember gods vision
6022454 if you select your own spot to be planted you will prove yourself to be an unproductive empty pod however if you allow god to plant you you will bear much fruit
6022455 it is a blow because alan stubbs is not just a great player and organiser he is also a fantastic leader and a great human being
6022456 the way he has handled himself over this injury and being forced to call it a day is testament to the kind of person he is
6022457 russell admires hicks and is very keen to be involved in the project
6022458 comedy has never been seen as russells strong point so this is an opportunity to change the publics perception of him
6022459 to those who say regime change is not an appropriate reason for acting i say weapons of mass destruction and the regime of saddam hussein are one and indivisible to remove weapons of mass destruction we must remove that regime to think anything else is to delude ourselves
6022460 to those who say what is the rush why cant we wait i respond by asking the question how long must we wait until the missiles have been launched until smallpox anthrax or vx nerve agent has found its way into our country is that how long we should wait
6022461 we conducted a simulated exercise of a smallpox attack i believe it was called dark winter simulating a smallpox outbreak put into a ventilation system in a mall in oklahoma city the consequences were catastrophic tens of thousands of deaths hundreds of thousands of illnesses civil law broke down these are the kinds of consequences that would be all too real were we to stay our hand
6022462 officials concerned are working through the process of putting him on the plane to take him out of the country but if he continues to refuse to leave then he will confined in the airport transit area temporarily before being taken into a detention center
6022463 now we are in talking and he seems to be a great mood laughing and enjoy chatting with our negotiators
6022464 its kind of breaking the ice first before asking him to change his mind
6022465 glitter flew out of ho chi minh city in vietnam on tuesday and was booked to change planes in bangkok en route to london after serving almost three years of a prison sentence for molesting children

6022525 the easiest way to think about it is what is the focus of treatment think of things that could be done to help meet the needs so success is inevitable without even thinking about services i think we have all failed in this area at one time or another and thats okay i think its important to regain your focus and not lose sight of what you are trying to accomplish i also think its important to continue to have conversations with your team about this so they can learn not to be so eager to request a service remembering needs arent services causes you to think more and work harder but it really is worth it in the end

6022542 im not really looking to let any players go but if an offer comes in for one or two of my players like every other manager ive got to balance the books
6022543 ive brought lots of players in and if i feel theres an offer that we think is a good offer obviously id consider it

6022642 its all because of the internet and websites that they came to know he was back playing rugby and getting into top form
6022643 he is going to leicester for a week to check things out its not yet finalised when he will be leaving but it could be by the end of this week
6022644 we want to know our clients business as well as they do the more we hear and listen to them and understand their vision the more we can align ourselves appropriately with them and help them meet their business objectives
6022645 giving associates the tools information and coaching they need to do their job is key to delivering great customer service
6022646 results are really important to me our team developed a tool that allowed the company to deliver 40 more business with the same resources weve always had our teamwork really paid off
6022647 i think the most rewarding part of my job is being a part of the problem solving team and being able to resolve issues quickly and with minimal impact if any
6022648 there are internal issues which will be resolved soon we are reorganising we dont have any problems with getting raw materials
6022649 while the dollar is strong that could well point to more declines to come in gold
6022650 one big thing for the gold market is what the etfs will do
6022651 if they are patient and believe in the market we could see upside again but if they dont im really sceptical
6022652 if we didnt have this physical demand i think gold would be much much lower

6022656 we are an independent state with an independent and fair judiciary system
6022657 over the past two months the situation has worsened and living conditions have deteriorated people have exhausted all their resources and are unable to feed themselves
6022658 they would call for a renegotiation and we will not renegotiate we have other options
6022659 it might be a very popular policy here to have an all out eradication
6022660 my policy is to secure and defend in accordance with the law innocent civilians and to preserve the integrity of the republic but not by eradicating people like they are mice
6022661 if the government declares an all out war we will also declare an all out war in mindanao
6022662 we are ready to kill and be killed the patience of muslims has run out
6022663 the most serious blunder that this sitting regime could commit
6022664 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like
6022665 it is nonetheless a system that establishes firmly again and reaffirms our cooperation and relationship with poland it will deepen our defence cooperation and it will deepen our ability to deal with threats
6022666 achieved the basic aims that mean poland and the united states are more secure
6022667 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
6022668 no one can dictate to poland what it should do thats in the past
6022669 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
6022670 no one should be afraid of the shield if they have good intentions towards us or the rest of the west
6022671 to promote fishing as a sustainable sporting activity and to make organised fishing activities available to the greatest number of members at the lowest possible cost
6022672 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6022673 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6022674 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6022675 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6022676 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6022677 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6022678 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6022679 who are open to doing something on the production side
6022680 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6022681 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6022682 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6022683 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6022684 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6022685 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6022686 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6022687 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6022688 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6022689 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6022690 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6022691 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6022692 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6022693 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6022694 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6022695 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6022696 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6022697 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

6022704 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6022705 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6022706 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6022707 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6022708 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6022709 i think im a little better at everything the advantages are im a better fighter
6022710 i think its just going to come down to whos the badder dude thats me
6022711 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6022712 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6022713 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6022714 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6022715 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6022716 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6022717 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6022718 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6022719 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6022720 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6022721 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6022722 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6022723 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6022724 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6022725 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6022726 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6022727 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6022728 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6022729 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6022730 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6022731 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6022732 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6022733 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6022734 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6022735 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6022736 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6022737 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6022738 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6022739 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6022740 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6022741 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6022742 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6022743 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6022744 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6022745 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6022746 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6022747 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6022748 its unfair that private electrical energy generators have additional profits above the normal of over 150 million dollars

6022759 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6022760 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6022761 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6022762 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6022763 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6022764 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed

6022787 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

6023015 we have got a good group of lads here with the under 21s and it is not just me who could move up there is james milner and i dont want to name names but there are loads of us that can move up and hopefully we will do
6023016 it was a mixed bag i know we can play better than that but you can never underestimate winning especially at international level if you asked me what i was looking for going into the game obviously a clean sheet obviously a few goals and a good performance
6023017 i did not get everything i was looking for and we can pass the ball the better and we can play better but every step at this age group is a learning curve for the players
6023018 we had maybe five or six players that competed for their clubs on sunday so obviously we were aware of that situation and maybe one or two had not featured for their clubs yet this season but we will go away and have a look at it when we meet with the coaches and it will stand us in good stead ahead of the portugal game

6023041 it is the first time ive picked him in the squad i followed him last season for three or four games and he didnt play well and for me was not fit but i saw his last game and he is fit now and looked in very good form i think he is an interesting player but i must stress the door is not closed for peter crouch
6023042 i have a squad and all the players are important tomorrow i will decide the first eleven but it is the last friendly match before the qualifiers what am i looking for i want to see england play like a team with spirit and without fear and show big personality

6023086 i was amused to read davids comments that he would rather his side suffered relegation every other season than be like middlesbrough david is a good friend but i can only assume relegation has affected his thinking a little
6023087 i seriously doubt boro fans would swap our recent histories
6023088 since moving to the riverside in 1995 we have achieved five major cup finals are the only english side outside of the so called big four to have played in a european final have enjoyed successive seasons of uefa cup football won our first major trophy and enjoyed 11 consecutive years in the premier league
6023089 its all because of the internet and websites that they came to know he was back playing rugby and getting into top form
6023090 he is going to leicester for a week to check things out its not yet finalised when he will be leaving but it could be by the end of this week
6023091 it is a blow because alan stubbs is not just a great player and organiser he is also a fantastic leader and a great human being
6023092 the way he has handled himself over this injury and being forced to call it a day is testament to the kind of person he is
6023093 weve got two half backs with us and theres other players as well with us this time whove played in that position before the likes of matt giteau
6023094 i think in the first instance it probably wouldnt be a surprise to you that well look to experience
6023095 so im giving you an insight there that we dont normally do ive broken protocol there
6023096 theyre elsom and horwill recovering well their progress has been good
6023097 we just have to see how they go see how they respond to that work and just push on and take it as it comes
6023098 in light of the broad scope of the organisational and procedural changes required for the effective implementation of the primary care proposals in newham and the limited financial burden that overseas visitors appear to be are having on primary medical services in the borough we conclude that the current proposals to streamline charging procedures at primary medical services with those in place at hospitals should be reconsidered
6023099 it is important that we know now how many palestinian refugees third countries are willing to absorb so that when we get to the critical moment of a peace agreement we will be prepared for such an eventuality and be able to carry it out
6023100 this is not something that has entered into the pipelines of practical considerations and i am not aware of specific discussion of this issue
6023101 the eu will be ready to continue to contribute in a clear manner to the final status of peace agreement as negotiations continue
6023102 we want to put this issue on the table and not keep it under the table and deal with it not tomorrow but today so that we can work on an agreed upon solution
6023103 we want to push the buttons so that the dynamics can begin
6023104 it has been a big mistake not to deal with the issue of the palestinian refugees
6023105 he has died doing a job he loved his family and the army were his life he will be forever missed by his wife children and family
6023106 this sighting confirms that she arrived safe and well in the city centre of her own volition
6023107 we would therefore ask mary to get in contact with police if she has decided to obtain accommodation in the area the family are extremely concerned about her health
6023108 even though it is encouraging that criminal convictions are being obtained the fines are in no way comparable for those handed out in england
6023109 i knew what i was doing was wrong i know i shouldnt have done it and i have owned up the only thing i would say in my defence was that at the time i was recovering from back surgery and had huge difficulties walking for a while i did inquire about getting my own badge but the bureaucracy involved meant i would not have had it in time for when i needed it
6023110 an increase in fines in scotland would ensure that the punishment adequately fits the crime
6023111 it is a travesty that people are fined so little for blue badge fraud it is frankly an insult to genuinely disabled people
6023112 the disparaging remarks about oxgangs are a disgraceful slur on an area undergoing tremendous regeneration
6023113 there is a real sense of community here with most residents striving to do the best for their area supposedly humorous pieces such as this completely misrepresent the oxgangs i know
6023114 i would be quite happy to show andrew clover around oxgangs even though he is meant to be a comedian the joke will ultimately be on him
6023115 contract negotiations have greatly reduced the additional costs this is the result of hard work from both sides and demonstrates the close partnership between ourselves and axiom
6023116 all of the new schools will provide a wonderful learning environment
6023117 i hope it will mean the money saved will go back into school buildings
6023118 in one sense it doesnt seem ideal that they are using old furniture but if its of a reasonable standard and in good condition i think anybody would say lets reuse and recycle rather than just throw it on the tip
6023119 it has gone on to be very successful for the group and we see it as a flagship development
6023120 in normal circumstances that would have happened but the credit crunch has meant a tightening of speculative developments overall and we are therefore seeking a pre let so that construction on the first phase can begin
6023121 the wound is a very significant one which runs from the left side of his mouth to his ear
6023122 there is a possibility that the attacker believed the victim had been with another group but weve not been able to establish a motive
6023123 the suspects may have been in the area 20 minutes before the attack hanging around the pizza express in deanhaugh street
6023124 this is a sickening unprovoked assault which is made all the worse when you consider it was carried out by a young boy in the company of older people
6023125 while we accept that constraints on runway capacity in the south east will limit the scope for the benefits of competition in the short term we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
6023126 in scotland where there are no similar capacity constraints we believe separate owners of edinburgh and glasgow would similarly improve their offerings
6023127 in scotland baa has until recently been noticeably slow to develop new routes at glasgow and edinburgh while at aberdeen its investment plans are regarded as unambitious despite relatively high levels of profitability
6023128 we remain of the view that glasgow and edinburgh airports serve separate markets and that competition between the two is highly unlikely regardless of ownership
6023129 this is a view shared by many of scotlands leading business organisations and is based on detailed and robust evidence
6023130 we are also surprised by the suggestion that a greater level of regulation may be required at aberdeen airport recently named the worlds most improved airport but the commission does not suggest this change for any other airport
6023131 if glasgow or edinburgh airport is to be sold by baa any potential buyer must show a strong commitment to continued investment
6023132 it is essential that we safeguard jobs and protect the interests of passengers
6023133 we all have an interest in continued growth at both airports because the success of scottish economy depends on strong transport links to the rest of the uk and europe
6023134 this is particularly important as we prepare to welcome visitors from all over the world for the commonwealth games in 2014
6023135 as far as i can see the competition commission have completely misread the situation in scotland which is a distinct market from england
6023136 glasgow and edinburgh airports really serve separate markets and all the research bears this out
6023137 the concern of business is that the proposals in the preliminary findings completely pull the rug out from under the feet of some of our most important assets for international trade
6023138 baas investment of over 500 million 40 million in edinburgh alone this year cannot be guaranteed from an enforced sale
6023139 my dismay at this report leaves me with one singular conjecture the competition commission cannot have even read the business communitys evidence which was universally in favour of supporting baas dedication to improved air services for scotland and their fantastic financial commitment to making that happen
6023140 as well as protecting homes and businesses from the threat of flooding the flood prevention scheme has been designed very much with the environment in mind
6023141 we are committed to enhancing and preserving the natural environment across the 14 project sites to allow flora and fauna to flourish
6023142 in inch park for example landscaping works will encompass a substantial planting programme
6023143 we have been calling for a more sustainable approach to flood management because we see this as an opportunity
6023144 allowing the river to function more naturally will have spin off benefits by helping enhance biodiversity and attract wildlife that in turn brings social and economic benefits
6023145 survival rates for breast cancer have been improving for more than 20 years eight out of ten patients now survive more than five years
6023146 this is partly due to our very effective screening programme cancer research uk is working to get even more people into screening programmes and to encourage everyone invited to participate
6023147 i was out for a walk with my boyfriend and his parents and just heard a noise ive got two cats so i recognised the sound of a distressed cat we were trying to work out where it was coming from and to be honest we were walking about making meowing noises
6023148 when we saw him in a kind of hole in the dock clinging on to the wall we tried to call the scottish spca or find someone with a boat to get him out but in the end we called the fire brigade
6023149 i hadnt seen him all night so he must have been out there for a good ten to 15 hours if that girl hadnt heard him cry he could be dead
6023150 i think there were about four fire engines out ive had teddy 13 years thats most of my adult life and hes like a son to me im so grateful to them
6023151 normally we wouldnt attend something like a cat stuck up a tree generally if they can get themselves up there then can get themselves back down
6023152 but in this instance the cat appeared to be physically trapped
6023153 when i saw the fire engines and the guys in the water i thought they must be pulling out a body but then i saw them lift out a little black cat
6023154 hes fine now the water is filthy but the sspca cleaned him up particularly well
6023155 my mum was buried two weeks ago and the headstone was lying on the ground
6023156 my brother actually had to step over it to lower the coffin i thought it might be something to do with the engraving but we were told by the funeral director it had been knocked off when they were digging the cemetery is denying that and say they are going to charge us
6023157 it will be lying there for about two months i think thats disgraceful
6023158 emotionally it is very distressing we want to take flowers and make it all nice but we cant do that while the stone is lying on the ground
6023159 the stone was laid flat because there was a health and safety issue it wasnt secure on its foundations so it wasnt safe
6023160 the family are talking about an additional inscription it will take six weeks to do the inscription and repairs they dont have to come to us to have that work done if they find someone who can do it quicker we certainly have no problem with that
6023161 british standards regulations have been brought in since the family got the stone which state headstones should be secured to their foundations by metal dowels if this is done they shouldnt have a problem with the stone again
6023162 i am deeply concerned that this family seems to have been dealt with in such a perfunctory manner at a time of such grief
6023163 it has just been badly handled whatever the technicalities there is a moral obligation for the cemetery to make sure the headstone is where it should be in time for the funeral

6023177 theres been lots of speculation every day and weve been linked with hundreds of players and i dont think well be signing all of them
6023178 ive no comment to make on speculation if we sign any decent players well release a statement but theres no point me talking about players who might or might not be coming to the football club
6023179 weve made good progress over the last day or two and i hope we have some news over the next 48 hours
6023180 its out of my hands weve made some great offers for players and good deals with clubs im quite relaxed about it
6023181 if players want to come and we can take them to another level fantastic but if they want to stay at the clubs theyre at good luck to them its not a major problem
6023182 im not really looking to let any players go but if an offer comes in for one or two of my players like every other manager ive got to balance the books
6023183 ive brought lots of players in and if i feel theres an offer that we think is a good offer obviously id consider it
6023184 he just decided to take a break for the tullaroan match

6023189 actual sales havent picked up because people are waiting on the sidelines as they fear home prices will continue to decline
6023190 as any working mother knows the pressures of being a mom a wife and having a job often conflict
6023191 having twins who are three years old obviously makes it all the more challenging naively i guess i had thought as they got a little older somehow things were going to get a little easier with my political career its proven to be the exact opposite
6023192 we look forward to hearing your vision so we can more better do our job
6023193 after standing on the stage after the debates i made it very plain we will not have an all volunteer army and yet this week we will have an all volunteer army

6023195 see we love we love freedom thats what they didnt understand they hate things we love things
6023196 according to the los angeles times the irs has decided to enforce a rule from 1989 that requires that employers that hand out cell phones to their employees report the cell phones as a taxable benefit the same law requires employees to keep detailed records of all calls made on cell phones issued by employers which indicate which calls are business and which calls are personal
6023197 congress is currently considering a bill to removing cellphones from the irs list of fringe benefits the bipartisan sponsored litigation passed the house earlier this year and a similar bipartisan bill this one sponsored by sen john kerry d ma and sen john ensign r nv is pending in the senate
6023198 now hes calling for a 20 percent tax on capital gains and certain dividend income which currently is 15 percent for individuals making more than 200 000 and families making more than 250 000
6023199 as for payroll taxes obama now wants to levy payroll taxes on earnings above 250 000 at a rate between 2 percent and 4 percent we wouldnt see that increase however for at least a decade
6023200 give taxpayers the option of pre filled tax forms to verify sign return to irs
6023201 income taxes and the breaks that different constituents are able to take year to year give congress power they can give special deductions and change the tax codes to make sure they get their campaign contribution from year to year it sounds shady and cynical but thats how i see it congress will never give up that power the second reason is what would we do with all of the accountants if doing your taxes amounted to adding up your w2 with any other forms of income and taking out 15 that seems pretty easy the tax code is so thick and complicated that weve created an industry to support it finally have you seen our national deficit americans seem to be following the lead of the government in spending more than we bring in our national debt is enormous and i dont see it being erased overnight with a new administration on top of that you have the social security and medicare issue to figure out in the next thirty years if we keep taxes the same something is going to either shut down or have benefits cut thats politically unpopular raising taxes is politically unpopular too but if it is the only way to keep the programs running then they will raise taxes

6023229 we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
6023230 risks delaying that delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
6023231 here we are at gatwick airport it has suffered investment wise because baa has focused more on heathrow airport
6023232 there are problems here which go beyond the monopoly which are to do with regulation the way investment is managed the capacity at airports runway capacity and so forth and also more broadly just the absence of any kind of grand plan since baa was privatized more than two decades ago

6023241 millions of americans suffer from problem or pathological gambling that can destroy families we support legislation prohibiting gambling over the internet or in student athletics by student athletes who are participating in competitive sports
6023242 my point is simple is the republican party no longer the party of personal freedom and individual responsibility
6023243 why has this party that used to protect my rights now become the party that wants to create a nanny state
6023244 i urge my colleagues to oppose the frank bill or any similar proposals that would create a permissive federal licensing scheme for internet gambling
6023245 a lot of republicans have a love hate relationship with the poker community

6023254 what captures the imagination and what is very interesting is to know how any given athlete when they are under pressure finds the resources to do better than they have done usually
6023255 that is what makes these athletes so special they can deliver when the whole world expects a performance
6023256 there is a mysterious thing in human beings that means some can go beyond their level when it is expected and others go below what they usually do
6023257 in sport we have all been confronted with that type of problem
6023258 its a binary outcome it can go one way or another
6023259 they already have an aging product if these new devices are great the stock price will go up if they are late it will go lower
6023260 there was such a thing about preserving the iconic style of the treo that people didnt want to change it

6023263 we needed to make newness out of something that was not terribly new
6023264 unfortunately we have had to abandon the rest of the meeting as the track is waterlogged in places and there is no prospect of it drying out
6023265 it is obviously disappointing both for the connections of the horses and the whole team so i am so sorry about that
6023266 its hugely frustrating and to be beaten by the elements is a very humbling experience
6023267 were determined to carry on with our drainage project to help guard against this in the future

6023286 its very hard to get rid of a sport in the olympics
6023287 this fantastic walkway is back in action in time for the august bank holiday which is great news
6023288 we were determined to restore public access as soon as the site was safe and secure
6023289 we have introduced a number of extra measures including mobile guards with dogs these will be on duty round the clock

6023294 while certain investors are understandably frustrated and upset by the delays the vast majority have demonstrated great understanding and patience and have expressed confidence in sch n properties and support for the dubai lagoon project it is not in the best interest of any parties involved with the project including developers to delay construction as material costs are exponentially rising therefore we are aiming to deliver the project in the timeliest manner given the unforeseen circumstances
6023295 im struck by how little time there is to work
6023296 here in geneva the players have been available to me for only two days and well have played only one match when we go to tel aviv when i was at dortmund or bayern munich we used to have about a dozen friendlies spread over six weeks
6023297 as time is precious i need to see in action those players who didnt feature in euro 2008
6023298 i dont even know if senderos will be fit again for israel
6023299 thats why it was really important to me to have djourou with us
6023300 but you can imagine that dortmund wont want to release him before hes even played a minute for them
6023301 i hope that patrick finds a team by august 31

6023304 terminal 3 and the associated development represent a much needed expansion of dubais aviation infrastructure the new facility will play an important role in supporting dubais economic progress and reaffirm the citys image as an emerging global aviation hub
6023305 raising customer service standards at dubai international is at the heart of our strategy we want to make absolutely sure that all the systems and processes at terminal 3 are working smoothly and that customers experience nothing short of world class facilities and service when they use the new terminal it is precisely for this reason that we have decided to make terminal 3 fully operational in phases
6023306 we are also conducting a series of operational readiness trials at terminal 3 and its airside facility as a run up to the soft opening in october
6023307 the mutation that causes most cases of wilson disease is well known but our study looks at the overall puzzle to see how such a small mutation can alter the shape and function of such a large and complex protein
6023308 this mutation occurs at a crucial location where the protein typically binds with a molecule called atp that provides the energy the protein needs to move copper from place to place
6023309 past studies have compared the behavior of the mutant protein with that of the nonmutant and found very little difference so it was unclear how this small change led to the devastating effects that are seen in wilson disease
6023310 this implies that the loop has some importance perhaps in regulation of atp7bs activities and we intend to follow up on this in our future studies
6023311 i believe that this novel signaling behavior could indicate the owls current reproductive status to potential intruders such as other territorial owls or non breeding floaters
6023312 such marking behavior may have been overlooked in birds and i hope that our story will represent the beginning of new and stimulating explorations on other questions and mechanisms in territoriality and social communication
6023313 faeces may represent an ideal substance for marking because it has a minimal energetic cost to the signaler and can continue to indicate possession of a territory when the owner is occupied in activities other than territorial defense
6023314 to obtain stronger evidence on the intriguing idea that eagle owls use faeces and prey feathers to signal current reproduction
6023315 we will need to perform further experimental studies and behavioral observations that examine whether faeces and feathers provoke specific behavioral reactions and what functional significance these behavioral reactions have
6023316 owls responded so rapidly to the removal of their faecal marks that during the night after the spraying that they came back to defecate not only on the same posts but precisely on the painted stretches
6023317 it is clear that some time and not a short period of time must pass in order to heal the wounds and to restore confidence only after this the conditions will be created for discussing practical aspects related to the problems of refugees
6023318 pending an international mechanism in south ossetia russian peacekeeping forces will implement additional security measures

6023354 abdominal aortic aneurysms sometimes extend to involve the iliac arteries blood vessel leading from the tummy to the groin
6023355 cook medicals zenith endovascular graft technology is unique in that it is the only technology currently available that allows a surgeon to repair an aorto iliac aneurysm whilst still maintaining a good flow of blood to these arteries thereby preventing these problems
6023356 unfortunately there are still a large number of surgeons who exclusively perform open surgery for these conditions when in my opinion minimally invasive endovascular treatments are far superior as such i think that endovascular surgery should be the primary method of repair for all aneurysm cases with open surgery being reserved for those patients in whom evar is technically not possible the case for evar is strong and i would encourage the medical community to think of evar as the new gold standard of repair

6023368 by outlining specific barriers to use in this population we provide a framework for future early interventions such as parent education and addressing confidentiality concerns

6023370 these national numbers for chronic lead poisoning are staggering but the percentage of affected children in older urban areas is much much higher than in rural areas or newer cities the blowing soil and dust young children ingest contains large amount of lead from lead paint and leaded gasoline deposited decades ago and from industrial contamination in indianapolis we found high levels of soil contamination many older urban centers have lead poisoning rates that are 5 to10 times the national average
6023371 our review plus the new directions we suggest for remoisturizing soil to prevent blowing of contaminants confirm that our approach to estimating lead burden and its remediation can be done anywhere in the u s where there is a lead concern the environmental protection agency and the u s department of housing and urban have focused their attention on indoor contamination as the direct source of lead to children it is now time to open the door and solve the contaminated soil problem we hope our study will raise awareness and ultimately funding to stop the poisoning of americas children especially those living in older urban areas
6023372 one of the key skin treatments in looking after eczema and ichthyosis is to use emollients as often as possible they are the foundation on which all additional treatment is based however the most important consideration is whether the patient finds the emollient recommended by their physician acceptable to use the most greasy that is tolerated should be used and this may vary during the day so that a lighter cream may be more appropriate for daytime use and a greasier one at night sticky messy or difficult to apply emollients will simply not be used as often as they should be so the patients skin condition can easily get out of control
6023373 ichthyosis varies enormously across and within the different types it is therefore very important for sufferers to have a choice of emollients which are appropriate to the severity of their condition
6023374 the combination of glycerol which improves the stratum corneum elasticity and white soft paraffin and liquid paraffin in dexeryl offers a highly acceptable non sticky and non greasy formulation which patients in our trials significantly prefer

6023385 magicians have developed powerful cognitive principles and intuitions about attention and awareness that are not understood scientifically
6023386 weve been able to learn more about cognition from magicians who have developed illusions that trick audiences
6023387 the collaboration on this project has led to many exciting insights to help us understand the brains underlying cognition
6023388 moms conventional wisdom of eating fruits and vegetables to lead a healthy life has evolved into more scientific fact finding research during the last four decades due to advances in science
6023389 studies are showing the importance of fruits vegetables and nuts in reducing the risk of cancer and cardiovascular diseases
6023390 it is befitting that the society is focusing more on health and preventing diseases
6023391 while we continue to consume various healthy foods several challenges of toxicity bioavailability of certain bioactive compounds and food drug interactions are yet to be understood
6023392 starions tissue ligating shears coupled with datascopes retractor and dissector represent an ideal system for endoscopic harvesting of both the radial artery and saphenous vein
6023393 this single safe and effective system does not alter artery or vein vasoreactivity and shows good results in terms of efficiency and patient satisfaction
6023394 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
6023395 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
6023396 im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
6023397 determining the degree of stenosis or how much the artery has narrowed is insufficient to predict patient risk
6023398 we know that the majority of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occur in patients whose blood vessels are less than 70 percent narrowed
6023399 patients with a reduction in gsm levels from their baseline ultrasound to the follow up ultrasound exhibited a significantly increased risk for near future adverse event compared to patients with increasing gsm levels
6023400 this technique will give us additional information to use in selecting patients that need aggressive treatment

6023403 messages such as those sent by dowle could never be part of a therapeutic nurse patient relationship he has failed to act in a way that justifies the trust and confidence the public must have in a nurse
6023404 we consider this a very serious departure from the professional standards expected of a nurse towards a vulnerable female patient in the care of a mental health trust he failed to observe the boundaries that must exist between nurse and patient to a very significant extent
6023405 the most important thing caregivers can do is to educate themselves on their responsibilities once theyve taken on this role
6023406 its not easy and can be further complicated by the emotional involvement the caregiver often has with the person theyre caring for be it a spouse parent other close relative or friend
6023407 its also important however that caregivers recognize they are not alone and that they seek help when they need it
6023408 inevitably when you begin talking about someones healthcare financial matters come into play so you want to designate someone you can trust who will be able to look at the whole picture
6023409 as a caregiver with power of attorney you are acting on another persons behalf
6023410 you want to make sure that you have a very clear understanding of what the individual you are caring for wants and that you truly are committed to acting in their best interest
6023411 just as you do with your own financial records as a caregiver you want to set up a system so that you can keep track of all the important documents of the individual for whom you are caring remember you really are stepping into their shoes you are responsible for making sure you know where things are and what needs to be done when
6023412 many working adults dont set up monthly budgets so long as the money coming in is far more than the money going out or needed for savings this lack of planning can work
6023413 but when youre dealing with an individual that has a disability that is likely increasing their healthcare costs and keeping them from ever returning to full time work good planning is essential
6023414 two thirds of ssdi applications are rejected and the average time it now takes from initial application through appeals to get an award is two to four years given all the responsibilities a caregiver has getting help from a representative reduces the burden substantially
6023415 while these plans can be costly they can be an essential financial planning component for individuals unable to get any other insurance and facing mounting healthcare costs while awaiting medicare eligibility
6023416 not all medicare plans are created equal and people often opt for the traditional plan thinking its the safe choice but for people with disabilities medicare advantage plans often are the optimal choice you cant be turned away for coverage due to a pre existing condition they usually cost less than a traditional medicare and supplemental plan combined and most medicare advantage plans include prescription drug coverage
6023417 i was delighted to be told that i had won the 2008 award i have spent the past 14 years undertaking health services research and pharmacy practice research the results of which i hope have and will help to inform future pharmacy practice and the safe and effective use of non prescription medicines i feel that this award recognises the contribution that my work in collaboration with many other colleagues has made i have always regarded this as a prestigious award and feel honoured to be one of the winners
6023418 dr watsons research makes an important contribution to the evidence base needed to demonstrate the input of pharmacy in delivering effective health care
6023419 for nearly half the worlds children especially girls and those from marginalized populations early childhood education is not guaranteed this is despite the fact that early childhood is the most significant period of development in our lives establishing the cognitive emotional and social foundation upon which we build our futures
6023420 by getting children ready for school we arm them with the tools necessary to build fulfilling lives become productive citizens and take their place in the global community
6023421 this symposium is vitally important as the more than 100 zambian and international experts will examine ecd best practices that can be implemented not only in zambia but globally
6023422 unicef has a strong partnership with the ministry of education in striving towards providing every zambian child with care development and education while they are still very young unicef is also pleased to be working in close collaboration with ngo and cbo partners in supporting the numerous early childhood care development and education centres eccde that are caring for zambias youngest children
6023423 after the symposium we are expecting increased opportunities for investment in ecd by national governments and also increased knowledge in early childhood care and development education provision in the region
6023424 we also expect to launch the southern african regional early childhood development forum finally symposium proceedings will be published for a wider national and regional audience
6023425 currently the hospitals use a standard test to work out how far the cancer has progressed and then they use this to determine the treatment the patient should receive however we are potentially able to more accurately predict who would benefit from chemotherapy
6023426 we now aim to carry out more work in this area to develop a prognostic tool which we hope will eventually be for widespread use by the health services in the treatment of bowel cancer
6023427 we have a very high number of patients with bowel cancer in the north east of england in particular we know the best treatment for very early and very late disease but there are still a lot of unknowns in between these two extremes
6023428 chemotherapy can be very useful but can have a number of side effects so we only want to use it where we think theres a good chance it will help this test will help us determine that
6023429 nature has developed all of this firepower for getting things into cells and one of the ways is to create entities that are arginine rich
6023430 arginine rich sequences appear to figure in the mechanisms by which many pathogens invade cells
6023431 its an exciting result to be able to take a drug known to work against cancer but stymied by resistant cells and restore it to effectiveness using an arginine transporter
6023432 this bodes well for use with other drugs that succumb to resistance
6023433 in essence the technology can be used to overcome one of the most challenging types of problems of drug resistance
6023434 if youre not recognized as being part of the club then youre kicked out
6023435 if we think of the pump as being a bouncer for the cellular club then effectively what were doing is disguising one of these therapeutic agents to get it in through the back door or the side door
6023436 this could potentially be used with any drug which is effective but has a delivery problem
6023437 as the transporter with all these arginine guanidinium groups approaches the cell it basically does a handshake using hydrogen bonds with cell surface constituents that are in the membrane
6023438 in essence it changes its physical properties by shaking hands with all these cell membrane components
6023439 ovarian cancer has a drug taxol that works pretty well in the beginning seventy or eighty percent of the patients have a response
6023440 but it fails at the end because drug resistance develops
6023441 lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
6023442 while we accept that constraints on runway capacity in the south east will limit the scope for the benefits of competition in the short term we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
6023443 just as the government is about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full length runways being built in the south east since the second world war the commission risks creating uncertainty delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time
6023444 in scotland the commission has apparently ignored the evidence presented by baa and supported by numerous respected third party organisations that clearly demonstrates that serve separate markets and therefore do not and would not compete regardless of ownership

6023449 while to some degree of course lgbt greens respect the autonomy of the decisions of the northern irish assembly the latest decision to not publicly challenge one of the most outspoken homophobic members of parliament can not go without comment
6023450 the petition received almost 16 000 signatories which for a petition set up only a matter of weeks ago is phenomenal
6023451 it is also clear from the petition that many northern irish and northern irish diaspora have signed the petition which along with the strong reaction against iris robinson at belfast pride suggest that straight as well as lgbt people are repulsed by her bigotry
6023452 without much fuss brown can make clear that the opinions expressed by robinson are intolerable
6023453 while his response states that theres legislation to deal with homophobia he has missed an opportunity to insist that the law makers should be among the first to practice what they preach
6023454 would brown idly stand by and allow racist mps to carry on unchallenged i doubt it
6023455 so why is he allowing homophobes to get away with broadcasting their hatred
6023456 this is a member of parliament whose homophobia seems to know no bounds someone who in the aftermath of a serious homophobic attack decided to talk of homosexuality as vile disgusting nauseating and an abomination
6023457 i have a very lovely psychiatrist who works with me in my offices and his christian background is that he tries to help homosexuals trying to turn away from what they are engaged in
6023458 i am happy to put any homosexual in touch with this gentleman and i have met people who have turned around to become heterosexual
6023459 there can be no viler act apart from homosexuality and sodomy than sexually abusing innocent children
6023460 we have provisionally found that there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports

6023468 it is increasingly apparent that the traditional newspaper model is under pressure whilst this can be mitigated in the short term by restructuring measures we are continuing to work towards the implementation of a new business model of a modern content and consumer business in the short term such comprehensive change is requiring both fundamental reorganisation and investment in the business with some impact on profits

6023471 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas lead singer dave matthews credited moore with arranging many of his songs which combine cajun fiddle playing african influenced rhythms and matthews playful but haunting voice the band formed in 1991 in charlottesville va when matthews was working as a bartender he gave a demo tape of his songs to moore who liked what he heard and recruited his friend and fellow jazzman carter beauford to play drums and other musicians the group broke out of the local music scene with the album under the table and dreaming

6023493 he is banned from entering thailand because he was jailed and he could pose a threat to domestic morality he is a transit passenger and it is the responsibility of the airline to take him to his final destination
6023494 we were last aware that he remained in transit he decides where he applies to go and the country or authorities there will decide whether they permit him to enter their territory

6023529 i dont understand for example how you could go to the middle east 21 times over the past few years and agonize for weeks on end on the israeli palestinian conflict over things like roadblocks building permits and border crossings and while millions of darfurians are going through a historical genocide you make only one short ineffective trip in four years to that part of the world

6023551 i wonder who of you right wing guys have actually ever left the us travelled to europe africa or asia
6023552 and by the way isnt it the european nations that can boast of the rising euro against the dollar universal health coverage and highest living standards in the world
6023553 the worst thing about liberals besides their economic illiteracy and irrational emoting is their horrible argumentative skills
6023554 and why should the rich pay more taxes the top 10percent of the money makers in the country pay 60 percent or higher of the total taxes
6023555 so were suppose to continue to punish those who have succeeded and no i am not rich and far from it i make less than 20 000 a yr i pay my share but the less someone makes the less they pay who convers the difference the rich do the people who work the hardest and make the most are punished and expected to care for the lowest now who is talking about fairness
6023556 ive read that the top 1 richest households in this country own almost all the wealth
6023557 the top 1 richest households in this country own almost half the wealth
6023558 anyway its funny to read the conservatives on this forum touting fdr as the kind of democrat todays liberals should be while i actually agree with that fdr was far more liberal than the spineless democrat congress we have today
6023559 thank god for people with courage and moral fortitude like pastor rick warren who are willing to examine the issues facing our country without regard to the profit motive or party loyalty freedom of the press should not be for sale
6023560 in the 20th century america entered upon the world stage powerfully and decisively coming to the aid of embattled european democracies and leading them to victory in two world wars and the cold war
6023561 the modern republican party from reagan through bush 1 and bush 2 have directed tax cuts and wealth to the very rich wilfully undermining the integrity of the usa bush 1 left the usa in heavy debt the democrats under clinton grew the economy and created a surplus when bush 2 came along he let spending rip and also funnelled more money to the very rich himself included he is leaving the national debt and the economy in tatters the usa is now in debt to the chinese and the oil rich russians but mccain will even accelerate this process the economic integrity and independence of the usa mean nothing when balanced against the republicans desire to create a champagne party for billionaires
6023562 when the democrats remember that they work for we the people not the other way around maybe they will start be the peoples party once again as for now they are the party for themselves and that is just plain ego and greed on their part they get to keep all those contributions after the election ends so they want to stay in power anyway they can and getting gulible people to agree with them is their pefred way so you just keep right on buying their lies and ill see you in the poor gulag when they turn this into a neo communist nation
6023563 wasnt really in love with america until he was deprived of her company
6023564 i want a president who loves america obama doesnt and mccain does
6023565 if it were up to me youd be the first to lose that right to vote

6023569 our clients were incensed by the level of illegal downloading in the first 14 days since topware interactive released dream pinball 3d it sold 800 legitimate copies but was illegally downloaded 12 000 times hopefully people will think twice if they risk being taken to court

6023581 anyone that says they dont want to compromise i think they are not doing a service to the state of california and to the people of california
6023582 i was annoyed that is not sportsmanship when you pull on someones feet
6023583 the first few times when people hit your feet you feel like shouting at them but you have to look ahead keep swimming and try to ignore it
6023584 if you start reacting then you are taking the focus off the race i know exactly who it was i think the tv camera picked it up that i had words with her at the end
6023585 i was so annoyed because i would never do that to anyone i didnt get to savour that moment of looking up and seeing my name in the medals because i was so angry however ive got a medal and she hasnt she claimed she didnt see me i wont say anymore because i dont want to start a war
6023586 i just keeping looking at the medal around my neck and thinking is it mine ive dreamt about this moment for 16 years and i cant describe how it feels
6023587 to be honest i had no expectations coming into this event i really didnt
6023588 it is such a long event two hours of solid swimming but down that last 1000m i knew i was in the top two and had a good chance of at least getting a medal
6023589 cassie and i didnt talk at all out there we are the best of friends and we just kind of knew when to kick at the right time i should feel exhausted but i dont its amazing what silver can do for you
6023590 id like to focus on the 800m freestyle next season
6023591 rebecca is obviously setting the standard and its great to have someone like that in the team to aspire to
6023592 mum if youre watching at home im fine and safe
6023593 falling doesnt do anything to your mental strength mentally i was prepared to go into the run the way i did but i washed out it was just one of those things
6023594 youve got to battle on if you want to win the gold my pride was dented but now im really excited about the final everythings going to come out of the bag then
6023595 ive not focused on it although im obviously chuffed for them
6023596 its been a rollercoaster few days but ive got a job to do if i do it then there will be time to celebrate with the others
6023597 you just got to keep your head on straight and not take everything to the head of course you are going to get a lot of articles written on you how good you are how bad you are doing a lot of naysayers a lot of people that will support you
6023598 you have to look at it like this just do what you got to do and do what you do best
6023599 you dont have time to worry about the people that doubt you you have to stay humble and just keep working hard to prove everyone wrong
6023600 i hope to get the opportunity to play a little bit as a freshman at the end of camp if im not ready to play i dont have to thats great because i can get another year in the weight room and then i get to learn a lot more of the offense
6023601 the practices are long it wears on your body in high schoos we had two a days but it was nothing like this
6023602 the pace of practice was not as fast it starts wearing on your body and the physical contact is bigger because the people are bigger youve got to learn to get in the treatment room afterwards
6023603 personally i kind of keep to myself more than other people
6023604 i see other guys and they look out for each other real well i try to keep to myself because im a freshman
6023605 but if youre having problems on the field the upperclassmen will come to you and ask if youre alright the biggest thing when i got here was when the freshmen would have trouble with their steps and greg isdaner ryan stancheck and mike dent would come up to us and tell us you got to do this and be real clam with us its nice to have those people around
6023606 it was big because back in parkersburg when i was there in the first part of the summer i was gaining weight and thats not where i needed to be when i came here i looked at a picture of me and its like i had a whole new face on me
6023607 it was crazy but it was great because i got used to the workouts and the running the first day of practice wasnt that bad because i could do wind sprints or just keep up with everyone when it came to running because college running is totally different than high school
6023608 this is definitely a big time university to play football
6023609 its not always about the big time college football its just your preference whether you want to be in the heat or stay here
6023610 she couldnt come up with eight time gold medal winner michael phelps name and then she yammered on about how she was the one training for a triathlon just six months after giving birth and how that was the big story right now not the swimmer
6023611 whether a sportsman is a professional or not will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case to be decided by the assessing officer
6023612 the circular is still in force and there are no new specific provisions on cash awards or gifts offered to sportspersons such a sportsperson would hence be tax free
6023613 unfortunately the novel sputtered coughed and died its a misery peculiar to would be writers your theme is good as are your sentences your characters are so ruddy with life they practically need birth certificates the plot youve mapped out for them is grand simple and gripping youve done your research gathering the facts historical social climatic culinary that will give your story its feel of authenticity the dialog zips along crackling with tension the descriptions burst with color contrast and telling detail really your story can only be great but it all adds up to nothing in spite of the obvious shining promise of it there comes a moment when you realize that the whisper that has been pestering you all along from the back of your mind is speaking the flat awful truth it wont work an element is missing that spark that brings to life a real story regardless of whether the history or the food is right your story is emotionally dead thats the crux of it the discovery is something soul destroying i tell you it leaves you with an aching hunger
6023614 the playing style is the best fit for the qualities of the players
6023615 this will not be just another friendly for our team because the dutch will be eager to settle the score so well have to be ready
6023616 egs could be the killer app of the energy world it has the potential to deliver vast quantities of power 24 7 and be captured nearly anywhere on the planet and it would be a perfect complement to intermittent sources like solar and wind

6023620 i am delighted as the whole country is we won the wrestling bronze long ago in 1952 helsinki games when k d jadhav from maharashtra did it i congratulate sushil on his great win
6023621 the goal we have always had is to try and create a community where people can live work play and be educated and do all of those things within that community
6023622 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
6023623 minority students in public schools already face barriers to success
6023624 by exposing these children to disproportionate rates of corporal punishment schools create a hostile environment in which these students may struggle even more
6023625 the other kids were watching and laughing it made me want to fight them when you get a paddling and you see everyone laugh at you it make you mad and you want to do something about it
6023626 what made me so angry hes three years old he was petrified he didnt want to go back to school and he didnt want to start his new school i was so worried that this was going to constantly be with him equating going to school with being paddled
6023627 i went into the principals office he gave me a chair and said hold onto the chair the paddle had holes in it then he just did three swats i was hit on my buttocks there were holes in the paddle to make it go faster it hurt very much there were definitely red marks and then swelling almost welt like markings it didnt last for more than a couple days it left me feeling very humiliated i think there were several levels of emotion physical pain mental humiliation and being a female at that age it was like there was this older man hitting me on the butt thats weird even at that age i knew it was inappropriate
6023628 ive heard this said at my school and at other schools this child should get less whips itll leave marks students that are dark skinned it takes more to let their skin be bruised even with all black students there is an imbalance darker skinned students get worse punishment
6023629 when it takes to producing clean power were determined to make new york the number one city in the nation
6023630 it was a bit like watching your children graduate from college
6023631 of course there was trouble between roma and united fans what about the prior ruckus between boudicea and the roman army the italians have obviously been biding their time
6023632 amy winehouse taking heroin you say no doubt the east india company is at the bottom of that one
6023633 of course there was trouble between roma and united fans what about the prior ruckus between boudicea and the roman army the italians have obviously been biding their time
6023634 amy winehouse taking heroin you say no doubt the east india company is at the bottom of that one
6023635 they persuaded me that there is always time to serve my country and that maybe i would be able to serve even better if i went to college first
6023636 i hardly doubt that its a coincidence that these schools are prospering at a time of war
6023637 inner city kids many from broken homes found stability and role models in junior rotc they got a taste of discipline the work ethic and they experienced pride of membership in something healthier than a gang junior rotc is a social bargain
6023638 students have to make the choice on their own to be here
6023639 were aiming at kids who arent in trouble but who arent fully realizing their potential either
6023640 we often see kids who have all the makings of being good students but have very unstable home lives because of economics and family structures we can make a difference in these students lives
6023641 before i would have to spend so much time as disciplinarian
6023642 i dont have behavior problems and on the rare occasion that something does happen its somebody elses job to take care of not mine
6023643 look at this when you were in school did you ever see it so calm
6023644 i like that we could become leaders and we know every student no bullies none of that so its real cool
6023645 its not like we have been given an enlistment quota here
6023646 liberal school administrators and teachers claimed that we were trying to militarize education yes ill admit the armed forces might get a youngster more inclined to enlist as a result of junior rotc but society got a far greater payoff
6023647 it would be really naive to think that the military would in fact be expanding these schools and these programs and pouring millions of dollars into the schools at a time when they actually are having a recruitment crisis if the schools were not about recruiting students
6023648 if the defense department is looking to us for recruitment then they are making a bad investment
6023649 find a way to make the attributes of the military model generic can it be done without the military we need to find a way to help the struggling youth of america without funding from the military
6023650 so many of these schools are so new and they claim that its too early to tell whether a school is successful so why are we still building them if we dont know
6023651 we have seen small schools projects be successful and the successes that are related to the military academies are in line with that
6023652 but there doesnt seem to be anything inherent to the military academies that leads us to say now theyve got the answer
6023653 the wealthier families in cities have the advantage of sending their children to private schools and a certain portion will go to the better public schools but in cities we know we are facing a particular demographic
6023654 if the military branches are formally involved as sponsors operators and funders
6023655 it is naive to expect them to resist the temptation to use these programs as a recruitment pipeline if anything given global conditions the pressure on them to do so probably will intensify instead of subside
6023656 the main thing for england is you need players who can play under pressure and do it under the spotlight because you know there is a lot of criticism waiting from the public
6023657 youve got to deal with that that is the hardest obstacle we are going to get over as a team playing under that intense pressure
6023658 some players can do it better than others that is just how it is we need england to get over that psychological barrier
6023659 its a process we might not go out there on wednesday and win 6 0 and have everyone saying we can be world champions we have to be realistic and build on our confidence
6023660 playing for chelsea and playing for england are two completely different things international football is different
6023661 i wouldnt say any one player lacks confidence we need to improve our mentality as a team we are doing that were not burying our heads in the sand we are trying to play and get the ball down we need to stay cool and calm
6023662 its pigeon steps the world cup isnt for two years we need to improve slowly so when we get there we are better physically mentally and technically
6023663 as a group its something we need to improve on we are doing things to improve we need to go out there and be free results help that theres no science to it you need the results to breed confidence
6023664 hey why dont we take the stairs back down because its good for your legs
6023665 you know you probably get this all the time but youre really the best teacher ive ever had in my life

6023952 there was some literature put out by the national right to life committee and theyre basically saying they felt like you misrepresented your position on that bill
6023953 well and because they have not been telling the truth
6023954 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion that was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe vs wade
6023955 i just read a copy of the illinois republican staff analysis on sb 1082 93rd general assembly and contrary to the bill status report on the illinois general assembly website it shows the bill as amended was in fact called for a vote in committee on a motion to recommend the bill for passage to the whole senate
6023956 that motion failed 4 6 0 along party lines and the chairman then state sen barack obama voted no the result is that the bill died in the committee
6023957 the amendment made my bill the same as the federal bill
6023958 i have full faith and confidence in what our files show absolutely
6023959 obama said that had he been in the u s senate two years ago he would have voted for the born alive infants protection act even though he voted against a state version of the proposal
6023960 the difference between the state and federal versions obama explained was that the state measure lacked the federal language clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade the 1973 u s supreme court opinion that legalized abortion

6024002 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6024003 it is nonetheless a system that establishes firmly again and reaffirms our cooperation and relationship with poland it will deepen our defence cooperation and it will deepen our ability to deal with threats
6024004 achieved the basic aims that mean poland and the united states are more secure
6024005 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
6024006 no one can dictate to poland what it should do thats in the past
6024007 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
6024008 no one should be afraid of the shield if they have good intentions towards us or the rest of the west
6024009 the first who attracts the eye the first in enlightenment in power and in happiness is the white man the european man par excellence below him appear the negro and the indian these two unfortunate races have neither birth nor face nor language nor mores in common only their misfortunes look alike both occupy an equally inferior position in the country that they inhabit both experience the effects of tyranny and if their miseries are different they can accuse the same author for them
6024010 if the colony of liberia were able to receive thousands of new inhabitants every year and if the negroes were in a state to be sent thither with advantage if the union were to supply the society with annual subsidies and to transport the negroes to africa in government vessels it would still be unable to counterpoise the natural increase of population among the blacks and as it could not remove as many men in a year as are born upon its territory within that time it could not prevent the growth of the evil which is daily increasing in the states the negro race will never leave those shores of the american continent to which it was brought by the passions and the vices of europeans and it will not disappear from the new world as long as it continues to exist the inhabitants of the united states may retard the calamities which they apprehend but they cannot now destroy their efficient cause
6024011 i do not think it is for me a foreigner to indicate to the united states the time the measures or the men by whom slavery shall be abolished still as the persevering enemy of despotism everywhere and under all its forms i am pained and astonished by the fact that the freest people in the world is at the present time almost the only one among civilized and christian nations which yet maintains personal servitude and this while serfdom itself is about disappearing where it has not already disappeared from the most degraded nations of europe an old and sincere friend of america i am uneasy at seeing slavery retard her progress tarnish her glory furnish arms to her detractors compromise the future career of the union which is the guaranty of her safety and greatness and point out beforehand to her to all her enemies the spot where they are to strike as a man too i am moved at the spectacle of mans degradation by man and i hope to see the day when the law will grant equal civil liberty to all the inhabitants of the same empire as god accords the freedom of the will without distinction to the dwellers upon earth
6024012 as far as i am concerned i came back from africa with the pathetic notion that at present in our way of waging war we are far more barbaric than the arabs themselves these days they represent civilization we do not this way of waging war seems to me as stupid as it is cruel it can only be found in the head of a coarse and brutal soldier indeed it was pointless to replace the turks only to reproduce what the world rightly found so hateful in them this even for the sake of interest is more noxious than useful for as another officer was telling me if our sole aim is to equal the turks in fact we shall be in a far lower position than theirs barbarians for barbarians the turks will always outdo us because they are muslim barbarians in france i have often heard men i respect but do not approve of deplore that crops should be burnt and granaries emptied and finally that unarmed men women and children should be seized in my view these are unfortunate circumstances that any people wishing to wage war against the arabs must accept i think that all the means available to wreck tribes must be used barring those that the human kind and the right of nations condemn i personally believe that the laws of war enable us to ravage the country and that we must do so either by destroying the crops at harvest time or any time by making fast forays also known as raids the aim of which it to get hold of men or flocks
6024013 we may say in a general manner that all political freedoms must be suspended in algeria
6024014 de tocqueville thought the conquest of algeria was important for two reasons first his understanding of the international situation and frances position in the world and second changes in french society
6024015 war in africa is a science everyone is familiar with its rules and everyone can apply those rules with almost complete certainty of success one of the greatest services that field marshal bugeaud has rendered his country is to have spread perfected and made everyone aware of this new science
6024016 there should therefore be two quite distinct legislations in africa for there are two very separate communities there is absolutely nothing to prevent us treating europeans as if they were on their own as the rules established for them will only ever apply to them
6024017 thus i fully acknowledge the great military qualities of marshal bugeaud this being said i may be given the liberty to add that marshal bugeaud achieved nothing nothing at all he did a lot of harm therefore he did not achieve anything and often he prevented action
6024018 the party of resignation marshal bugeaud has not been disowned he has just not been recalled
6024019 when i hear that marshal bugeaud handed in his resignation and that it was turned down i cannot help assuming that maintaining marshal bugeaud in africa is less for the good he could do in the name of france than the harm he might be expected to do here in paris
6024020 lets not repeat in the middle of the 19th century the history of the conquest of america lets not imitate those bloody examples that the human kinds opinion has seared
6024021 the committee is convinced that the future of our sway over africa of the enrolment of our soldiers and the fate of our finances will depend on how we treat the natives for in this respect the questions of humanity and budget bear on each other and mingle

6024060 you just respect them so much and admire them some of these two three time olympians thats a lot of training
6024061 basketball is my favorite sport its my love but coaching volleyball is its a fun sport its got so much more interest going at the moment watching it on the olympics the girls tell me all the time how excited they are and how they enjoy watching it and they wish they could hit as hard as those girls

6024075 with over one third of it departments likely to have one or more environmental criteria in their top six buying criteria in 2010 it makes good business sense too

6024077 we were extremely pleased to receive our iso 14001 accreditation but we do not intend to rest on our laurels we will continue to look at reducing our own carbon footprint and encouraging our customers to join us in a variety of green community initiatives

6024083 there are a number of trends currently driving the quite astonishing growth we are seeing in this sector the growing importance of the indirect sales model and the increasing importance of solutions and services are both important contributing factors much of the merger and acquisition activity we are seeing in this space is being driven by customer demand for broader more integrated solutions and to expand support coverage
6024084 database archiving often fails to get the attention it needs compared to other critical activities related to production databases and data warehouses
6024085 an archival system becomes critical when you need to access archived information in response to a legal summons customer service issue security investigation or technical issue the value of archiving grows considerably as it becomes easier to access the archived data
6024086 with legal demands for access growing conventional approaches to database archiving are increasingly being found lacking they focus on lifting and shifting inactive data from production databases to improve application performance without considering how to optimize the way archived data is stored get your archiving right and you reduce storage costs and guarantee simple future proofed access get it wrong and at worst you could face prison
6024087 why database archiving should be part of your dbms strategy
6024088 it managers need to achieve a balance between the compliance demands for retention and the business demand for economical storage and retrieval current database management system technology is optimised for transactional processing data warehouses are optimised for analytics but both fail to adequately address archiving needs worse still the lines between archive stores and backup which have very different drivers and requirements are all too often blurred
6024089 forresters research clearly illustrates the need for the new generation of archive stores these deliver both massive reductions in storage footprints through data compression together with the security immutability and point in time query capability that enables quick simple and unimpeachable fulfilment of regulatory obligations
6024090 we have all been there we call for service only to be 134 in the queue when we simply need a balance update or tracking number consumers are increasingly mobile and interact with a myriad of companies through call centers often using their mobile phones they demand quick response times and easy to use systems
6024091 sms provides an easy to use mobile solution that doesnt require long wait times or interactive voice response systems to better serve mobile customers and save money organizations with call centers should take advantage of text messaging
6024092 our customers prefer sms it saves them the trouble of having to dial in to the call center or visit a branch to get the account information they need with sms our customer gets convenience and fnb saves money in addition to delivering a better customer experience sms has also greatly reduced call center costs associated with communicating routine account information
6024093 with the widespread use of mobile phones and innate understanding of text combined with our customers desire to maintain active control of their finances fnbs incontact has provided our customers with the ability to take advantage of their cell phone as a powerful banking tool
6024094 interacting with customers through sms costs a fraction of what a live agent costs are so the cost savings for us have been tremendous and the communications are effective and pleasing to the customer which helps our business
6024095 organizations across all industries should take full advantage of these cost savings by implementing text based call center services in any industry financial services or otherwise

6024141 demi allah allah akan menghidupkannya kembali di hari kebangkitan dengan dua mata yang akan melihat dan lidah yang akan berbicara yang akan memberi kesaksian mengenai mereka yang menjamah nya
6024142 utusan allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam menghadap batu hitam menjamah nya dan lalu menempatkan bibir bibir nya di atasnya dan menangis dalam jangka waktu lama

6024181 im fine im fine im just trying to drink this fiber stuff and it tastes bad

6024190 this does not mean one should never take action against aggression or injustice instead one should try and develop an inner calmness and insight to deal with these situations in an appropriate way one could say that there are three ways to get rid of anger kill the opponent kill yourself or kill the anger which one makes the most sense to you
6024191 god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change courage to change the things i can and wisdom to know the difference
6024192 if we examine how anger or hateful thoughts arise in us we will find that generally speaking they arise when we feel hurt when we feel that we have been unfairly treated by someone against our expectations
6024193 it is almost as if we have become crazy these are the negative effects of generating anger and hatred we realize that it is necessary to distance ourselves from such emotional explosions
6024194 the only factor that can give refuge or protection from the destructive effects of anger is the practice of tolerance and patience
6024195 forgiveness is a form of realism it doesnt deny minimize or justify what others have done to us or the pain that we have suffered it encourages us to look squarely at those old wounds and see them for what they are and it allows us to see how much energy we have wasted and how much we have damaged ourselves by not forgiving
6024196 forgiveness is a sign of positive self esteem we no longer identify ourselves by our past injuries and injustices we are no longer victims we claim the right to stop hurting when we say im tired of the pain and i want to be healed forgiveness is no longer wanting to punish those who hurt us it is understanding that the anger and hatred we feel toward them hurts us far more than it hurts them
6024197 holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else you are the one who gets burned
6024198 if someone insults us we usually dwell on it asking ourselves why did he say that to me
6024199 perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us once beautiful and brave perhaps everything terrible is in its deepest being something helpless that wants help from us
6024200 it is natural for the immature to harm others getting angry with them is like resenting a fire for burning
6024201 fuck it im not happy god dammit ive been doing everything right fuck a duck damn sam screw it all im pissed

6024228 they glare or curse at us when we have to slam on our brakes to avoid hitting them

6024280 this is an interesting discovery and a lot more important for us because he was dressed in full kit
6024281 we actually find out a lot more about the australians during the first world war by finding bodies such as this one
6024282 the most likely scenario from what we can tell at this stage is that he was part of the attack on messines ridge
6024283 then they were pushing on to further objectives when he was hit and fell and was then covered over by a shell blast or buried in some way and that is where he has lain for 91 years
6024284 we definitely know he wasnt buried by his mates because he was in full battle kit he was still holding his rifle when they uncovered him he had his backpack on he had hand grenades in his pockets and he had all his ammunition and his helmet
6024285 it is a very positive start to the id process
6024286 the belgian war graves currently have custody of the body the australian army will then be in charge of the investigation to try and identify him

6024302 it is by the grace of the lord that we are able to speak to you
6024303 but there are some people who have access to the gmb who come and try to sell us maize at exorbitant prices
6024304 we are now surviving on umtopi alternatively we engage in barter trade a big goat can get you two 20 kilogrammes of maize
6024305 i have been coming here daily for a week and a half and they keep telling us that wagons bringing maize from south africa are coming today
6024306 when a few do arrive the grain is given to the same people who seem to be enjoying preferential treatment
6024307 the situation back at home is dire and our people are surviving on fruit and roots like wild animals
6024308 starvation is no longer confined to rural areas and it could be even worse here in town
6024309 some households are now going for days without a full meal because they have no access to the foreign currency needed to buy maize from the black market
6024310 last week a former zanu pf councillor from enyandeni collected 200 bags from the gmb and gave ten bags to each zanu pf official in the area for their own consumption
6024311 when the new councillor went to collect maize for the ward only 150 bags which are hardly enough for the community remained
6024312 i have since written to the governor angeline masuku to protest against this corruption which has become endemic but i have not received a satisfactory answer
6024313 there is no food it is a fact that the rural population especially in southern zimbabwe is in dire straits some of us with rural constituencies are afraid to visit some villages as people have not eaten for days
6024314 there can never be an explanation as to why there is no food when the country has the experience of mobilising and moving food into areas with acute shortages someone is not doing his or her job for political reasons
6024315 zimbabwe has become one of the worst man made humanitarian disasters of a new and hopeful century an estimated half a million zimbabweans have already died of starvation malnutrition and preventable diseases
6024316 because of the failed policies of zanu pf more than five million now face starvation and famine we cannot allow this to happen

6024320 this is how we live i sell goats cows and chickens in foreign currency to people from the city and that enables me to buy what i need in botswana

6024360 the torture sequence was only ever cut in the uk release to avoid a 15 rating in the us however a couple of action set pieces were quite heavily toned down to avoid an r in comparison the uk release is considerably more complete its true though that the australian release on both dvd and blu ray and the r3 versions dvd only the hong kong and korean blu ray releases are actually just duplicates of the us bd feature neither of these cuts and supposedly represent martin campbells intended vision for the film

6024377 we started off to talk about change and they have embraced the change
6024378 its all about the journey so whatever is happening no one can take away the journey weve had
6024379 i think we needed that outside source to come in and shake things up a little bit and give us new opinions and a new mind frame about everything
6024380 there was no time to dwell on the past she came in with this aura of confidence like you know what she said what she was going to say move on get over it were moving forward either you want to win or you dont want to win
6024381 of course she was very genuine and knew people were hurt but we had no time to dwell on it

6024389 i think we have players in the club who can play in a variety of positions
6024390 robert koren jonathan greening kim do heon or james morrison can play wide left or wide right
6024391 at the weekend we didnt have the options to do that because we didnt have a midfield player to release one of them
6024392 we ended up with two left footers playing but the department is well covered by various players
6024393 by bringing marek in i was trying to create competition in all areas of the pitch
6024394 it is important that paul robinson has genuine competition for his position at left back and maybe the fact that marek cech was at the club contributed to the fact that paul robinson gave such an outstanding performance on saturday
6024395 it might not have been the direct reason but i think competition focuses the mind of every footballer in the team
6024396 its important that we have that competition and marek understands that
6024397 hes had a course of injections to tighten his ligament up and it will take time
6024398 hes not ready to be involved for the reserves yet
6024399 hes doing nothing at the moment apart from his weights hes just taking his time
6024400 hes coming along ok hes been doing a bit with the physios
6024401 id be raising hopes if i said when i thought hed be back in full training but hes just ticking along nicely and doing fine
6024402 the physios are happy the doctors are happy and hes happy at where he is at the moment
6024403 but anything i say puts pressure on him hes alright
6024404 because weve got carl ikeme too thats why i can take it nice and easy with matt without pushing him at all
6024405 a minimum of 46 games is a long long season so well take it nice and easy with matt
6024406 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone

6024430 together we can change the shape the future of chicago and show the world who and what chicago is all about
6024431 we have always lived in a brutally difficult product landscape in the late 1990s netscape had gone from a position of having enormous market share for the browsers probably as high as in the 90s i think before microsoft got involved to a steadily declining market share partly because microsoft is a great competitor and theyve built some good products and partly because they engaged in a campaign of illegal activities and then you combine those and the netscape market share had been dropping steadily for quite some time so its clear that the way of producing a browser and how we were trying to keep choice and alternatives alive had to be done differently thus open source
6024432 nfl network game extra represents the kind of online collaborative experience verizon fios tv and broadband customers expect

6024437 the public interest can best be served by getting as much broadband in front of as many people as possible as quickly as possible and ensuring that investment keeps up with demand
6024438 to a large extent this is a matter of taking down the barriers to investment and refraining from erecting new ones
6024439 removing entry barriers to facilitate investment as new york city has recently done in granting a franchise
6024440 forming partnerships and revamping the universal service fund to bring broadband to rural communities
6024441 over taxation of innovation such as we currently see to a disproportionate degree in the wireless industry
6024442 we believe that network and applications providers can and must work together to find solutions that work for the industry and for our customers
6024443 and verizon has taken a leadership role in doing just that
6024444 techniques which in field tests have dramatically reduced network costs and congestion while noticeably improving the performance of the service to the customer
6024445 offers a model of the kind of industry cooperation and collaboration that should be used to address the emerging challenges of the internet industry
6024446 a legitimate role in helping to define the public interest establish principles and adjudicate conflicts
6024447 dynamic industries like ours require flexible solutions that can evolve and adapt to a changing environment not rigid regulatory solutions that are one step behind the marketplace
6024448 ninety percent of patients with huntingtons disease have chorea and many suffer terribly its hard to describe the torment that these people undergo we had several patients who experienced a dramatic improvement in their quality of life some patients who hadnt been able to attend church for years were able to do so others were able to go out to a restaurant and have a meal for the first time in years its impossible to over emphasize what this has meant to some patients who are able to reclaim part of the life that they have lost due to this disease
6024449 patients and families with huntingtons disease maintain a courageous hope for progress
6024450 on one hand the fda approval of tetrabenazine represents only a small step forward this medication helps patients control their movements better but is not known to slow the underlying progression of the disease on the other hand the fda approval represents a giant symbolic breakthrough since tetrabenazine is the first drug ever approved in the united states for any aspect of huntingtons disease it is an honor to be part of the extended community of patients families and researchers trying to find a better way forward
6024451 my mother and many others have died without the benefits of tetrabenazine
6024452 since the medication was invented in the 1950s worldwide it has been give to close to a million people we have a tremendous amount of information about its benefits potential side effects how to treat the side effects and dosing suggestions this is day to celebrate for huntingtons patients and their families
6024453 it seems possible that divers will be used to remove ballast from the vessel in order to make it light enough to be lifted out of the water and for further repairs

6024458 in tough economic times low fares airlines can continue to stimulate the market with their low fare structure this was demonstrated in the period after 9 11 which showed this and this current period will show we have already seen ryanair announcing several new bases and major route expansions in the past few months during periods of inflation low cost retailers such as wal mart and low cost service providers such as ryanair are the ones who will survive
6024459 as flights become more popular and reach capacity we would plan to introduce more services our model drives growth by constantly lowering fares and adding more services
6024460 the dynamics of the airline industry have changed completely and low fares airlines have taken the lead as the only driver of passenger growth the caribbean has seen no measurable reduction in fares as seen elsewhere and air travel in the region remains in the hands of traditional airlines who charge for services most people dont need
6024461 the interest from the investment and business community in the caribbean ireland and the united kingdom has been fantastic we have had no problems convincing potential investors of the merit of our project and we are currently working with them to secure the necessary funding which will meet the ownership and control requirements placed on an airline based in barbados

6024672 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
6024673 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
6024674 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
6024675 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
6024676 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
6024677 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
6024678 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
6024679 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
6024680 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
6024681 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
6024682 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
6024683 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

6024691 cameron needs to support a common european foreign policy and the mechanism in the lisbon treaty that will achieve this

6024694 the residents should not be paying for new development it should pay for itself
6024695 its fair we have a great little town if people want to live here they should pay the charges
6024696 our client loblaws is extremely frustrated with the process unless this matter is resolved under the present financial structure the building of the no frills store is in jeopardy in the foreseeable future
6024697 an additional cost for the charges cannot be justified at this time under current economic times
6024698 wed like to bring closure to the charges which would allow my clients to be forthright and honest with their perspective purchasers
6024699 our consultants advise us that your charges remain high if your costs are more than barrie and you require us to pay the money in advance you will kill the goose that laid the golden egg
6024700 this is there to help the town with its cash flow needs by the time residential development comes weve already been required to build infrastructure the town wants to ensure that growth is paid for by growth otherwise the burden to bear these costs is transferred

6024758 at this moment thaksins legal team is proceeding to ask for political asylum for thaksin and his family in britain
6024759 his asylum request will note their malicious treatment in thailand where they lack security and freedom
6024760 targeting national reconciliation the political process and democracy in the country
6024761 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
6024762 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6024763 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
6024764 john mccain is pro life always has been and his administration will be pro life anyone picked as his vice president will respect those views
6024765 let me tell you first what i wont do i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president and not know necessarily what hes doing
6024766 my vice president will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law
6024767 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6024768 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6024769 both sides have achieved their goals this is a great success for poland
6024770 for that reason no one who has good intentions toward us and toward the western world should be afraid of it
6024771 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
6024772 nothing about us needing to explain to someone why where to and for how long the black sea fleet ships are leaving their walls
6024773 without a doubt there wont be any mine fences or military collisions one shouldnt even talk about that
6024774 i think that russia is looking for a reason to have a serious conflict with ukraine
6024775 i think this is a direct and deliberate slight and snub to the leaders of the pacific island countries assembled here in niue
6024776 the challenge for us in these meetings is to uphold and stand firmly behind that principle of democracy
6024777 what im hearing from others whove been to fiji is that the commodore is not just baulking at the commitment for march 2009
6024778 there is no timetable for 2009 2010 2012 or any other time
6024779 let me place on record that the commitments that commodore bainimarama made at the leaders retreat were not forced on him as some have claimed
6024780 pacific island countries are saying to the countries of the world that the time for action concrete action over climate change is now
6024781 should deals with the hot files mainly ending the internal split and resorting unity

6024793 these special forces work with the americans they are not associated with the ministry of defense
6024794 some said they are connected with the prime minister others said they are connected with higher authorities
6024795 i think the formal process kicked off yesterday with the establishment of a nato georgia commission and we have taken seriously the commitments the heads of government made in april
6024796 its an important signal but there is also important substance to it
6024797 in practical terms nato is offering close cooperation with the georgian government and the georgian military that means helping the georgians build up their capacity
6024798 it means building up proper interoperability with nato proper joint training it also means ensuring the structures of cooperation are properly geared towards eventual membership so this is a route map to membership
6024799 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
6024800 ten years people were saying how could these countries be members of nato
6024801 they are independent countries they are not ex soviet union they are independent sovereign countries with democratic governments who have every right to make their own decisions on the basis of their own popular will
6024802 i think its right to see georgian and ukrainian membership as part of a process to build up these countries as a permanent fixture of the international landscape not just as an accident
6024803 my mother is still there she was too old to flee
6024804 a bomb came down it exploded and i saw four people killed in front of me the russians are barbarians we hid in the basement
6024805 this is our territory i only intend to go back to my city when the last russian solider has left
6024806 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
6024807 el ajuste a la baja de la renta de las familias y de su capacidad de endeudamiento aconseja centrarse en las tasas intertrimestrales

6024912 the settlement agreement with icm provides these talented television writers with a fair resolution to their claims
6024913 however we still have a lot of work ahead of us to get these older writers the programmatic and monetary relief they deserve
6024914 im not sure this icm settlement is going to make an impact
6024915 it will impact people in the agency pool as opposed to people in the networks or production companies
6024916 the agencies have the most difficult positions because they are in many ways the gatekeepers of these jobs the agents need to explain why theyre not taking on clients in that demographic
6024917 what the court of appeal decision will do if it stands is increase the cost of litigation
6024918 the burden of discovery and this kind of discovery will be enormous and it drives up the cost of litigation which can drive people to make a rational decision to settle rather than litigation on principle
6024919 the settlement agreement with icm provides these talented television writers with a fair resolution to their claims
6024920 however we still have a lot of work ahead of us to get these older writers the programmatic and monetary relief they deserve
6024921 im not sure this icm settlement is going to make an impact
6024922 it will impact people in the agency pool as opposed to people in the networks or production companies
6024923 the agencies have the most difficult positions because they are in many ways the gatekeepers of these jobs the agents need to explain why theyre not taking on clients in that demographic
6024924 what the court of appeal decision will do if it stands is increase the cost of litigation
6024925 the burden of discovery and this kind of discovery will be enormous and it drives up the cost of litigation which can drive people to make a rational decision to settle rather than litigation on principle

6024930 we thought wed grow five times not 20 times thats a nice surprise for traffic but maybe not such a pleasant surprise for the cost structure
6024931 we had already positioned ourselves with mainstream and healthy content from day one
6024932 if youre purely user generated then to be honest you may have a lot of racy content and brand advertisers are very wary and uncomfortable

6024939 all the evidence is that the demand side of the economy is pummelled
6024940 this acquisition gives salesforce crm customer service amp support unique technology that provides a better approach to knowledge base management
6024941 and the timing is ripe companies have been asking for a better way to organise their corporate knowledge to serve customers and this acquisition will help salesforce com to differentiate itself from the competition
6024942 were excited to add this unmatched technology to our saas applications and force com platform
6024943 not only will it make our service and support offering stronger for our customers and further their success but it will help catapult our growth in the customer service and support space
6024944 the sites have still not been decontaminated and continue to pose a threat to the health of thousands of people
6024945 we met many of the victims who still show symptoms of their exposure to the waste they still have headaches and sores among the victims there are particularly vulnerable people those who have little money to feed themselves let alone to get treatment
6024946 it is regrettable that events have caused us to review our shareholding and whether it is appropriate that the virgin brand should remain linked to virgin nigeria
6024947 the behaviour of the authorities was similar to the way the mafioso behaved in the us in the 1930s and not what i would have expected from the authorities in nigeria
6024948 if virgin nigeria can be treated in this way can any company in the world seriously consider investing in nigeria in the future
6024949 the first seasons harvest has been so poor because of a long dry spell while heavy rains pests and diseases are destroying crops for the second season
6024950 we anticipate tougher periods for idps internally displaced persons and other people in months to come because the food quantity from the first season harvest was inadequate to feed them for the coming months as they await the second harvest that is being badly affected by the rain
6024951 i thought i would get seeds from the first seasons harvest for planting in the second season but there is virtually nothing the long dry season destroyed the beans maize millet and groundnuts that were maturing
6024952 currently the market cannot provide enough for what we need this means there isnt enough food for distribution to idps
6024953 we are currently implementing a food security assessment in gulu and amuru to try to determine crop yield this activity will go on for the next one year to help determine crop yield and requirements for intervention
6024954 imperial college is known globally for carrying out research that improves quality of life worldwide the business schools activities play a central role in this mission by putting the colleges name into the business schools title we are making clear its position as an integral part of the college
6024955 the growth and development of the business school under the helm of professor david begg and former rector sir richard sykes has been a source of great pride since my association with it began its increasingly lofty academic standing has been acknowledged by many international surveys its place within a leading science technology and medicine university offers it many opportunities to develop still further and to carve out a unique role in business research and education this latest move is a step towards enabling it to reach its maximum world wide potential

6024974 both diesel and fertiliser are among our major resources for farming just like electricity
6024975 it is therefore our concern that the prices of fertiliser and diesel have risen three fold this means that our farmers will not be in a position to produce as much crop to feed the nation as they did last season 2007 08
6024976 with these subsidies the number of our vulnerable but viable farmers benefiting from this programme will increase from 125 000 in 2007 to 200 000 next season
6024977 whereas we appreciate the governments decision to provide more fertiliser under the support programme there are still many many small scale farmers who will not benefit from the programme this is why we are now encouraging our farmers to go for conservation farming as the best practice at the moment
6024978 as znfu we have conclusively proved that conservation farming can produce wonders if we can produce at least 2 5 tonnes per hectare then we would be feeding the whole region and conservation farming is able to guarantee that at national level we are currently producing 1 3 tonnes per hectare
6024979 we have helped 6 000 farmers so far and we hope to help 80 000 farmers over the next five years
6024980 to clear off bank loans and other drafts that were outstanding
6024981 the only way forward for zambia is to ensure our farmers grow more food to avoid imports food has a critical role to play in a countrys inflation and if we cant grow enough then the prices of food and indeed all commodities are likely to be even more expensive next year
6024982 i think this is the right time to start thinking of alternative means of production
6024983 i left two other brothers there in tanzania who are married and with children and who must also get a share of this land
6024984 i have started making bricks i think it will take me 14 days to get them ready and if i build a house i will try to work and live as best as i can while waiting for my case to be settled
6024985 i am surprised to find that i am not even authorised to use a classroom while waiting to build my house when there is a disaster people seek shelter in schools yet they have no pity for us
6024986 others returnees find that the government used them their land for social infrastructure take the urban centre of nyanzalac for instance it was built on peoples land
6024987 logic would dictate that the new occupant vacates the land and return it to the owner but it is not as simple as it seems
6024988 some were given title deeds to the land others have exploited it for more than 30 years and under burundian law this entitles them to the land others have lived on the land for generations and simply have nowhere to go
6024989 my land was given to a senior army officer when i returned home i was forced out i had left a whole plantation of palm oil but i accepted not to claim it just to save my life and was given another piece of land in nyanzalac
6024990 now that the owner of this land is back they are telling me to share the small piece with him or leave it if the occupant of my original land leaves then i will leave this one
6024991 now they come and force us out overnight that is not the way it should be done
6024992 we only sensitise them telling them to share land whenever possible but it is not always easy
6024993 if the land issue is not dealt with adequately it can be the source of potential violence
6024994 weve never had this situation before but i have assessed this young man and he has all the skills and qualities including maturity
6024995 the players respect his mobility and his ability and thats why he has come through the ranks so quickly he deserves it of course he will find the premier league a challenge but that is what refereeing is all about at any level you choose it is always a challenge
6024996 this was a bit of a one off but we wouldnt rule out further use of video as part of petition responses in the future
6024997 how can it be that we have allowed our lands iraq afghanistan palestine kashmir chechnya our people our resources our wealth and our very dignity to be eaten up and destroyed by the enemies of islam when we have such great potential among us if only we unite as one umma

6025005 for the safety of everyone we have to explore the marine environment and to quantify for example the loading or forces exerted on structures by internal waves and currents
6025006 for example over the next 25 to 50 years will there be an increased incidence of cyclones on the north west shelf will they be stronger will their geographical extent change these are current research questions and the answers could have engineering implications
6025007 as exploration moves further offshore these pipelines are becoming longer and are being laid in deeper water
6025008 there are a number of proposals to install more pipelines with some companies looking at laying lines up to 1000km long
6025009 we still have a poor understanding of the ocean physics the nw shelf is also one of the most energetic parts of the global ocean with very large tides and the occasional cyclone
6025010 we will examine marine issues such as the effects of shore stabilisation sea level rise tides internal waves and the implications for engineering activities
6025011 we plan to be in a position to forecast ocean conditions particularly near the bottom where any pipelines will be laid before companies venture into new areas

6025046 nonetheless with inflation close to a peak and the economy heading towards recession we still think rates could be falling by the year end and will eventually drop much further than the markets expect

6025048 something i dreamed about since i started swimming was to win an olympic gold medal
6025049 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible

6025051 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
6025052 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
6025053 phelps im at a loss for words now like i was after the race its something that you always want to do and dream of doing and you think that you can do but its never really real until you do it the biggest thing that ive been thankful for is that i have been able to use my imagination when some people said its not possible and it cant be done i think thats when my imagination came into play and i thought i had a chance to do it bob bowman and i talked about it and we were able to get here through a lot of hard work its been fun and this is something that will always be a part of me being able to equal mark spitzs record is an amazing accomplishment for me and im thankful for him and all the help and support hes given me i definitely want to thank him for that

6025055 honestly learning how to play corner will give you confidence
6025056 learning your technique and really learning the game what theyre going to do on offense and having been there will give you confidence
6025057 when you play with confidence you will truly play a lot better youre not out there thinking wondering what will i do here and whats going on there when you just go out there and play just play naturally thats great youll play great
6025058 youre never as bad as they say or as good as they say
6025059 just continue to work continue to work and youll be all right

6025076 identified several research areas that could be of interest to the intelligence community neurophysiological advances in detecting and measuring indicators of psychological states and intentions of individuals the development of drugs or technologies that can alter human physical or cognitive abilities advances in real time brain imaging and breakthroughs in high performance computing and neuronal modeling that could allow researchers to develop systems which mimic functions of the human brain particularly the ability to organize disparate forms of data
6025077 our research clearly shows that 40 of people from british ethnic communities keep in touch with their families back home by calls or text an extremely costly habit to maintain we are therefore very excited to launch this campaign as part of the programme we have launched an exclusive expat survival guide blog www vykehome com offering first hand advice on coping with homesickness and adapting to life in the uk sourav himself will be writing a number of the blogs we are extremely excited to have sourav on board as his global lifestyle and strong connection with friends and family make him the perfect vyke user and ambassador

6025084 the selectors are comfortable this move will maintain the competitive edge for the australian side and provide a wonderful opportunity for brett geeves to join the australian group for the first time
6025085 i played for the national team from 14 years old until the under 21s and when i see all the boys coming through from that side i want to get involved as well
6025086 i always played with wesley sneijder rafael van der vaart and robin van persie
6025087 it wasnt difficult to see them progress because i knew i wasnt ready for it
6025088 i felt that pogatetz was the obvious choice as captain because he is a leader
6025089 he is such a strong character and has lots of qualities hes an organiser on the pitch
6025090 he missed some of the pre season games but i knew fitness wise it wouldnt be too much of a problem with him
6025091 he got a cut in the first half but there was never any question that he would not be back out for the second half
6025092 i was amused to read davids comments that he would rather his side suffered relegation every other season than be like middlesbrough david is a good friend but i can only assume relegation has affected his thinking a little
6025093 i seriously doubt boro fans would swap our recent histories
6025094 since moving to the riverside in 1995 we have achieved five major cup finals are the only english side outside of the so called big four to have played in a european final have enjoyed successive seasons of uefa cup football won our first major trophy and enjoyed 11 consecutive years in the premier league
6025095 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
6025096 i am also shattered that i cant lead the australian davis cup team in chile in our bid to rejoin the world group and hope that the boys can still come through with a great win

6025116 the chiefs of the disbelievers among his people said we see you but a man like ourselves
6025117 you are only followed by the poor the meek and the worthless

6025119 listen noah if you want us to believe in you then dismiss your believers they are meek and poor while we are elite and rich no faith can include us both
6025120 only allah will bring it the punishment on you if he will and then you will escape not
6025121 verily we sent noah to his people saying warn your people before there comes to them a painful torment
6025122 o my people verily i am a plain warner to you that you should worship allah alone be dutiful to him and obey me he allah will forgive you of your sins and respite you to an appointed term verily the term of allah when it comes cannot be delayed if you but knew
6025123 o my lord verily i have called my people night and day i e secretly and openly to accept the doctrine of islamic monotheism but all my calling added nothing but to their flight from the truth and verily every time i called unto them that you might forgive them they thrust their fingers into their ears covered themselves up with their garments and persisted in their refusal and magnified themselves in pride then verily i called to them openly aloud then verily i proclaimed to them in public and i have appealed to them in private i said to them ask forgiveness from your lord verily he is oft forgiving he will send rain to you in abundance and give you increase in wealth and children and bestow on you gardens and bestow on you rivers
6025124 my lord they have disobeyed me and followed one whose wealth and children give him no increase but only loss and they have plotted a mighty plot and they have said you shall not leave your gods nor shall you leave wadd nor suwa nor yaghuth nor yauq nor nasr names of the idols and indeed they have led many astray and o allah grant no increase to the zalimeen polytheists wrong doers and disbelievers etc save error
6025125 and indeed we sent noah to his people and he stayed among them a thousand years less fifty years inviting them to believe in the oneness of allah monotheism and discard the false gods and other deities
6025126 o noah does carpentry appeal to you more than prophethood why are you building an ark so far from the sea are you going to drag it to the water or is the wind going to carry it for you
6025127 you will come to know who will be put to shame and suffer
6025128 and as he was constructing the ship whenever the chiefs of his people passed by him they made a mockery of him
6025129 if you mock at us so do we mock at you likewise for your mocking
6025130 noah must have gone out of his head what is he going to do with the animals
6025131 so it was till then there came our command and the oven gushed forth water like fountains from the earth
6025132 embark therein of each kind two male and female and your family except him against whom the word has already gone forth and those who believe
6025133 o my son embark with us and be not with the disbelievers
6025134 i will betake myself to a mountain it will save me from the water
6025135 this day there is no savior from the decree of allah except him on whom he has mercy
6025136 o earth swallow up your water and o sky withhold your rain
6025137 away with the people who are zalimeen polytheists and wrong doing
6025138 o my lord verily my son is of my family and certainly your promise is true and you are the most just of the judges
6025139 o noah surely he is not of your family verily his work is unrighteous so ask not of me that of which you have no knowledge i admonish you lest you be one of the ignorants
6025140 o my lord i seek refuge with you from asking you that of which i have no knowledge and unless you forgive me and have mercy on me i would indeed be one of the losers
6025141 when the death of the messenger of allah noah approached he admonished his sons indeed i would give you far reaching advice commanding you to do two things and warning you against doing two as well

6025153 a dream was born in us that a well crafted sentence and reasoned argument could cause the mob to drop their stones that songs must be sung in the dark to remember light that great stories are told and danced to help us become human
6025154 that we must be with those who suffer and journey with them wherever their pain may take them that we could travel over the wastelands of despair and war and finally become the great city on the hill that this republic will one day be worthy of the dreams that gave it form and being
6025155 that every human person is by some unimaginable grace the living image of an infinite love that is god and therefore no human is ever unnatural or disordered in very essence that we might find in the end the power to forgive and more miraculously allow ourselves to be forgiven

6025318 mit der vorgeschlagenen investitionskontrolle setzt die bundesregierung ein wirtschaftspolitisch falsches signal f r den investitionsstandort deutschland
6025319 als exportweltmeister und wichtiges herkunftsland von auslandsinvestitionen ist deutschland stark auf offene m rkte angewiesen daher muss deutschland besonders offen und attraktiv f r ausl ndische investoren sein
6025320 diese investitionen sichern wertsch pfung und arbeitspl tze in deutschland mehr als zwei millionen arbeitspl tze in deutschland lassen sich direkt unternehmen in ausl ndischer hand zuordnen

6025328 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
6025329 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously

6025357 it should work similar formations entomb oil and natural gas for millions of years or at least until drillers punch through but are there enough geologic containers with tightly sealed lids to hold industrys co
6025358 since 1996 the norwegian oil company statoil has injected 10 million metric tons of co
6025359 late in 2008 scientists at the pacific northwest national laboratory plan to begin experimentally injecting 1000 tons of co 2 into porous vol canic basalt in washington state within two to three years the labs studies suggest the carbon dioxide will begin a chemical transformation to a mineral first some of the co 2 will react with water trapped in the basalt forming weak carbonic acid the acid should dissolve calcium in the basalt which in turn will react with more co 2 to form calcium carbonate in effect limestone according to mcgrail such basalt occurs worldwide including under large expanses of india with enormous storage potential
6025360 in a more unlikely scenario some scientists have proposed that large quantities of carbon dioxide could be stored on the bottom of the deepwater ocean where high pressures would compress the gas into liquid form denser than seawater the liquefied co

6025365 sometimes you are at school and if there are shots being fired in the favela your mom calls and says do not come up
6025366 favela dwellers also say they need cell phones for safety
6025367 since pre paid phones without credit can still receive calls the called party can call back if necessary
6025368 i then waited 10 minutes and thought if anybody calls within 10 minutes i will return the phone if not i will turn it off nobody called and i turned it off then i bought another sim card and gave the phone as a present to my brother it was a brand new phone
6025369 in s o paulo cell phones were the most stolen items in 2007
6025370 even if the cell phone just rings somebody might follow you after you get off the bus and take it then if the device is a good one he will sell it in the favela if it is a cheap cell phone he will give it to the kids to play with

6025425 a perfect storm of negative economic trends is battering working families across the united states
6025426 health care costs are climbing much more rapidly than incomes or the growth in the overall economy
6025427 what is notable is how these problems are spreading up the income scale
6025428 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6025429 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6025430 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6025431 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6025432 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6025433 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6025434 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6025435 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6025436 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6025437 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6025438 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6025439 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6025440 that the united states would be obliged to defend poland in case of an attack with greater speed than required under nato
6025441 this is the old trick used by conservatives use the crisis of the moment to support a pre existing agenda
6025442 the iraq war was the most serious hoax on the american people but it was preceded by the push to deploy anti missile weapons after the attack of september 11 president bush used that tragedy to increase spending for anti missile systems and to pull out of the anti ballistic missile treaty the fact that terrorists dont have missiles and that the attacks had nothing whatsoever to do with the anti missile systems didnt matter the tactic worked the democrats in congress folded least they look weak 60 billion and several broken treaties later we still dont have an anti missile weapon that works and osama bin laden is cavorting safely in northern pakistan they are at it again this time using the russia georgia conflict to justify a project they fear is slipping away for the past two years the administration has been insisting that the weapons were aimed at iran not russia suddenly the line has shifted led by senator john mccain whose foreign policy seems to have been completely captured by the neoconservatives they have left one dying host to infect another
6025443 the us does not need a rush to deploy a technology that doesnt work against a threat that doesnt exist
6025444 the senate and the house armed services committees have wisely restricted any funding for missile systems in poland or the czech republic until both parliaments approve the plan and the proposed weapons republicans may try to strike that language from the bill in the senate this september this is a test for the democrats are they strong enough to stand by their convictions will they expose this placebo defense and the hypocrites who push it or will we see the traditional democratic dive on defense september will tell us a great deal about whether the new obama led party is serious about charting a new course
6025445 this is not just about missile defense this is about demonstrating to russia that america is still a nation of resolve and were not going to let russian expansionism intimidate everyone
6025446 when there is a bully in the schoolyard whods picking on the little kids he needs his ass kicked
6025447 gosh if we were just nice enough to the russians i just know they would straighten up and fly right
6025448 all he has to do is name hillary and hes guaranteed to win the election
6025449 the russians are assholes the russians have always been assholes and they always will be assholes they have been bullying and intimidating their neighbors and anyone else they thought they could get away with from time immemorial from the czars to the bolsheviks they are dicks and the only thing they understand or respect is power and the resolve to use it katrina if you want to voulenteer to fly over there drop to your knees and suck putins dick go for it maybe if you do a real good job hell change his ways but i seriously doubt it
6025450 well enough of the hillary supporters will swing to obama but many will still vote mccain
6025451 mask has a problem with women because hes attacking me for being obsessed with the political fortunes of a female politician
6025452 obama can prove hes smart by picking hillary for veep and guarenteeing his victory
6025453 what provokes them to assert authority over these provinces is our policy of trying to co opt these provinces into our sphere of influence i say stop the provocation and you get a different response from russia
6025454 we must end the growing militarization of us policy and call on russia to do the same
6025455 its time to pursue an alternative more sane and effective course
6025456 im am voting for this person because i think they will advance this nation and congress will be able to keep them in check to make sure they dont pass all the crappy policy i know they will pass
6025457 katrina i see nothing wrong with a defense sheild in eastern europe as russia has been known to run over smaller countries every time they think that that country is leaning toward democracy or threatening to join nato history has shown that russia cannot be trusted
6025458 he just has to swallow hard and do what jfk did
6025459 the polls show 25 percent of her supporters have not gotten on board
6025460 hes got to be very concerned by the neck and neck polls and by what happened at saddleback
6025461 ah yes not insulting those ever peace loving muslims takes prioroty over the first amendment
6025462 if you can be a good boy and let me do this shopping quickly i will let you pick out a new pack of gum

6025504 you definitely learn the business side but at the same time they know the business side better than i do
6025505 theyve been doing it a long time and im sure theyre going to do whats best for the organization and whats best for me right now im a baseball player and just like coming to the park and playing
6025506 is he 100percent ready probably not especially on the defensive end of it hes got a ways to go but hes pretty good hes got a ways to go in terms of game calling how to get hitters out he wouldnt embarrass himself i know that
6025507 i think you definitely have the confidence in yourself if you dont believe you can do it you probably wont be able to do it
6025508 i definitely believe that i could do it right now but at the same time every day you go to the park theres something new to learn no matter what level youre at
6025509 coming from college where youre getting two or three days off a week i think the biggest adjustment is playing 130 out of 140 games thats a big accomplishment your first year
6025510 i wish we had those kinds of problems in more positions
6025511 theres nothing you can control about when you get called up or where youre playing all you can control is how youre playing where youre at
6025512 it was a terrible shock when we heard about the crash and we have been inundated with calls and messages from members of the polish community showing their support for these people
6025513 the reaction in the community was immediate and our thoughts are with the friends and family of those involved the hotline will advise people and will offer free interpreters
6025514 we are still trying to recover and get back to work after what happened the people on the bus havent got over the fact they have lost a friend and co worker
6025515 we have lost a lad which was the last thing we wanted to do and we have got several others still in hospital
6025516 he was a good guy weve had him here for three or four years
6025517 probably the most difficult for me just because i didnt think it was going to be good no matter how it ended up
6025518 i think a lot of those kids theyre all great kids
6025519 i believe in them tremendously as people i want them to be successes in life not just on the football field to me this whole thing is a preparation for that youve got to be able to deal with ups and downs
6025520 if you have an opportunity to take advantage of it if this isnt your opportunity you have to keep working until the next one comes and then youve got to be ready
6025521 all three of us as a group have sort of moved forward like new offensive coordinator james franklin said in the meeting this is the decision and were going to go with it and everyone has bought into it the most important thing is that every day we get better and really progress as a team
6025522 hes my roommate to be honest with you weve talked about it but at the end of the day we both understand how this whole thing works the unique thing about this team is that everyone has bought into this whole team thing
6025523 what i can tell you is that im really excited about the university of maryland and the program and the direction were headed our offense thats what im focused on
6025524 ive been saying since i got here that we have three quarterbacks that can win in the acc our job now is to find the guy who can win the acc championship
6025525 we are further along after the seven months here than after two years at the last school i was at
6025526 how to get a special girl to like me when she doesnt even know i exist
6025527 the commercial church the new face of religion in america
6025528 the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
6025529 is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe its time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw back to the status quo ante of august 6 7
6025530 what is a promise worth when it is not fulfilled
6025531 russian military action has been disproportionate and inconsistent with its peacekeeping role as well as incompatible with the principles of peaceful conflict resolution
6025532 today nato demonstrated that it originated in and it is still from the time of the cold war it doesnt matter what their propaganda says
6025533 georgian president mikhail saakashvili got the right to start a war against the small people of south ossetia just because georgia had nato aspirations
6025534 the us was greatly involved in the preparation of this georgian aggression and here in brussels they were afraid to engage in a frank discussion with russia in the presence of their european allies
6025535 if nato wants to cooperate with criminals we cant stop them but we cannot cooperate anymore with an organization which works with criminals
6025536 if the european union had not moved tbilisi would have been captured
6025537 russias actions were never intended to destroy occupy or force regime change in georgia
6025538 we will keep our very good bilateral contacts with nato members and hopefully there will be a better time sooner or later when nato understands that the world is very vulnerable and that bloc approaches are no longer possible
6025539 its clear russias relationship with nato wont stay as it was before there will be a lot of changes in the volume quality and time frame of our meetings
6025540 this situation will change but there will be no cold war
6025541 people who focus strictly on gdp would have missed a very big story in japan
6025542 these numbers are going to be revised six ways to sunday
6025543 when i take a look at these four they all peaked and rolled over at different times from last october to february of this year
6025544 so when i do my homework i can see that the recession started i think in january
6025545 an oil shock a housing shock and a credit shock
6025546 housing is the quintessential leading indicator housing peaked in 1988 and then we had a credit crunch in 1989 and then the onset of a consumer recession in 1990 were just replaying an old movie
6025547 reflate the housing stock as an antidote to deflation in the tech markets in the early 2000s
6025548 this was like mary shelleys frankenstein they built the monster and then they had to tear it down
6025549 the path to financial ruin is littered with calls of a bottom and i dont think you want to confuse intermediate bottoms with fundamental bottoms i think that is quite a dangerous game to play
6025550 i think what separates my call say from the consensus is that i dont necessarily think this is going to be a mild flash in the pan i think this is going to be a long recession
6025551 this is an epic event were talking about the end of a 20 year secular credit expansion that went absolutely parabolic from 2001 2007
6025552 whether or not im right on the recession call ending theres going to be an extended period of economic weakness once it does as post bubble deleveragings are a multi year adjustment process
6025553 this is going to be a painful but necessary surgery so that we can get out of the hospital and embark on the next bull market of economic expansion
6025554 its important to note what sort of surgery that is going to require we will probably have to eliminate 2 trillion of household debt to get there
6025555 american households own more than 4 trillion of consumer durable goods so something tells me that is going to be a venue for shrinking the household side of the balance sheet
6025556 were talking about the silverware the old antique couch in the basement unwanted or expensive art
6025557 peoples expectations have changed and so their behaviour is going to change dry cleaning was down upholstering was down beauty salons were flat its about getting out the old tool kit and doing it yourself
6025558 im not going so far as to say were going to live in a cave but life is going to change there are going to be some very hard decisions made over the household budget as to what to allocate to consumer discretionary spending
6025559 move from reallocating items on its balance sheet to aggressively expanding its balance sheet
6025560 usually 95pc of its balance sheet is in treasuries now its down to 50pc i think the feds approach is going to have to change
6025561 playing in the fifa world cup is an ambition shared by the entire nation and were looking forward to a full house and vocal support from queenslanders to help the players on the journey to south africa
6025562 we will have to work hard to achieve qualification but playing in the fifa world cup is something every player wants to do and they know what they need to do to get there
6025563 there has been an adverse finding in her a sample against her blonska
6025564 and there is a process being followed against her however she has not been stripped of her medal
6025565 there will be a disciplinary commission hearing about her case on thursday morning and because she is a medallist it will be then passed to the executive board
6025566 the a sample was positive and the b test will be tonight
6025567 i think you can see by the reactions from the other athletes that we are not interested when she is there we dont support cheats
6025568 she has cheated once who says she is not cheating again
6025569 we knew however that we could improve the power to weight ratio with several select modifications lamborghini has its gallardo superleggera ferrari its f430 scuderia and dodge its viper acr now the corvette z06 has the clubsport package from katech performance
6025570 i dont want to get sued since im unemployed and cant afford jail time unless a man named naruse ryo who looks like ohno who knows sakurai sho can bail me out of jail using his awesome lawyer skills
6025571 we warned these whores but they did not stop their business said the note left with the bodies of the women one of whom was in her 20s and the other in her 40s police said
6025572 we have sent the bodies for autopsy they were shot dead and the face of one woman was brutally mutilated khan said
6025573 the women appeared to be from middle class families and the relatives of one women have identified her
6025574 its taking a long time to do what its going to do
6025575 and whatever it ends up doing we will most likely be dealing with it until the end of the week
6025576 we started making plans on sunday with the worst case scenario in mind
6025577 once we were all ready to pull the trigger so to speak we stopped and assessed the situation for the time being were not opening shelters and were not closing schools or government offices were just monitoring and waiting to see where the storm goes weve got plans in place so we can make some quick decisions if we need to
6025578 right now the forecast is showing it coming ashore around jacksonville but the swath of possible paths is wide
6025579 any time we have standing water on the roads almost without fail we see a fatality
6025580 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks like it could be a boomerang storm
6025581 adding new taxi stands near regional transit system bus stops in each hospitality district effectively creates multi modal transportation hubs that should make transportation safer and more accessible to the public during peak traffic hours
6025582 are not infallible and that unintentional mistakes may have been made
6025583 our transportation staff has been approachable and willing to listen to parents
6025584 and the ease of e mail has made it possible for there to be a lot of communication between parents and our staff
6025585 my parents thought skateboards were for hoodlums and i guess they were right
6025586 drivers across the country can fight rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation tires that are underinflated by just six to seven psi can reduce vehicle fuel economy by as much as 2 percent and tire tread wear can also be reduced by as much as ten percent
6025587 tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas are wasted annually by u s drivers simply because theyre driving on underinflated tires
6025588 in addition that same 2 8 billion gallons wasted result into 56 billion pounds of carbon dioxide released into the environment
6025589 we can all help prevent this by making sure our tires are properly inflated
6025590 people can find the tires proper inflation level on the vehicle placard located in the driver side door jamb in the glove box or in the owners manual
6025591 our clients were incensed by the level of illegal downloading in the first 14 days since topware interactive released dream pinball 3d it sold 800 legitimate copies but was illegally downloaded 12 000 times

6025597 real yields tend to fall sharply and on occasions they go into negative territory when there is slower or recessionary growth
6025598 if you begin to look at some of the emphasis of growth shifting from the u s and more towards other counterparts there is a great chance for real yields to be lower relative to the u s

6025673 me lo ricordo bene anche se sono passati quasi trent anni era il 9 agosto 1979 un gioved eravamo a bussoladomani di viareggio io ero un giornalista alle prime armi 21e0 lui uno che veniva gi dalla montagna e non se lo filava ancora nessuno legammo subito forse la scintilla scatt perch ero l unico a parte quelli della sua casa discografica che conosceva le sue canzoni aveva appena pubblicato il secondo album non siamo mica gli americani e quel giorno cant albachiara in playback finita la serata lui e la sua addetta stampa dellepoca marisa caravati mi accompagnarono fino alla stazione di la spezia io all epoca abitavo a chiavari
6025674 ero sicuro che ce l avrebbe fatta a imporsi ma per immaginare un successo cos clamoroso ci sarebbe voluta la sfera di cristallo comunque le basi le ha messe allora a forza di esibirsi in locali semivuoti ma aveva una tale forza interiore che diceva a se stesso qui torner l anno prossimo e far il pieno cosa che succedeva regolarmente perch quando lo vedevi in azione ti stregava letteralmente quindi si innescava il passaparola
6025675 credo perch la biografia pi esauriente sul periodo iniziale della sua carriera quella che racconta passo dopo passo i primi successi ma anche le delusioni e i sogni ho avuto la fortuna di frequentarlo assiduamente e quella frequentazione mi ha permesso di diventare testimone oculare dellorigine di un mito vi d una notizia in anteprima dopo che un ampio estratto del mio libro uscito come allegato a max a settembre la rizzoli lo ripubblicher nuovamente questa volta in edizione integrale con tanto di diario di vasco e la sceneggiatura mai realizzata del fumetto bollicione
6025676 quando usc il libro la prima reazione di vasco fu demoralizzante a chi gli domandava cosa ne pensasse rispondeva che lo trovava cupo che non ci si rispecchiava che c erano molti episodi che non avrebbe voluto rendere pubblici
6025677 per lui stato senzaltro un momento molto particolare stata una grande rivincita rispetto ai cosiddetti addetti ai lavori che per troppo tempo lo hanno snobbato oggi incredibile a dirsi ma nei primi anni ottanta molti colleghi mi prendevano in giro a causa di quella frequentazione e degli articoli che scrivevo su vasco
6025678 certo che ha qualcosa da dire altrimenti come si spiegherebbero gli stadi pieni e le centinaia di migliaia di copie del disco che continua a vendere

6025700 over the five days in sheffield we have so much going on over 50 sessions with 250 speakers a marketplace with over 100 buyers doing millions of pounds of deals and around 120 films screening in the cinemas
6025701 we are also stepping into areas of programming around interactive work and cross platform projects including a documentary based game at the festival and a cross platform pitching competition people can only get to a fraction of the programme and this series with c21 will help capture lots of the event and offer the festival delegates and many more people access to the revelations debates and insider tips for a lot longer than those five brilliantly busy days

6025717 non voleva cedere al flusso di ricordi ed emozioni forse provava un senso di lealt verso la propria storia una cosa accennare a unesperienza usarla come riferimento e analogia ma descrivere il fatto orrendo nei dettagli a estranei che annuiranno e dimenticheranno doveva sembrargli un tradimento del proprio dolore
6025718 it was like racing a car at max velocity when you hit a curve you either maintain control or you crash and burn
6025719 today i crashed and burned im shocked and sad but im happy for the girls
6025720 it was like racing a car at max velocity when you hit a curve you either maintain control or you crash and burn
6025721 today i crashed and burned im shocked and sad but im happy for the girls
6025722 we call her the terminator back home shes been a father and a mother shes such a tough lady
6025723 we call her the terminator back home shes been a father and a mother shes such a tough lady
6025724 there has been a lot of good response and a lot of criticism its kind of blowing up i suppose its all good for me if it gets my name out there
6025725 there has been a lot of good response and a lot of criticism its kind of blowing up i suppose its all good for me if it gets my name out there
6025726 not only has the snp government promised that this scheme will continue it is even looking at extending the scheme to injured service veterans
6025727 in the lothians many thousands of people benefit from concessionary bus travel and they will continue to benefit in the future
6025728 it is disgraceful that opposition parties should attempt to frighten elderly people in this way and is another illustration of how desperate they are to counter growing public trust in the snp administration
6025729 there were a lot of projects in deprived parts of edinburgh which were unable to get funding any more
6025730 what i am aiming to do is to put together a good well argued case for the retention of sub post offices which are important for the local community showing what the effects would be on local people
6025731 there is more to good schooling than exam results but i am delighted that edinburgh is continuing to maintain a good performance in examination results and that higher pass rates have continued to increase
6025732 i would like to pass on my congratulations to all the young people in edinburgh for their individual achievements and to their teachers for helping them to fulfil their potential
6025733 we really want to focus on how collectively as a state we can do a better job of keeping young people in schools and keeping them engaged
6025734 this is an ongoing effort to increase interest in pockets of bergen county
6025735 having a basketball court right next door to you guys is great if basketball is what you like its a great tool
6025736 we can get out and practice all the time shoot 100 shots a day
6025737 this is an ongoing effort to increase interest in pockets of bergen county
6025738 having a basketball court right next door to you guys is great if basketball is what you like its a great tool
6025739 we can get out and practice all the time shoot 100 shots a day
6025740 survival rates for breast cancer have been improving for more than 20 years eight out of ten patients now survive more than five years
6025741 this is partly due to our very effective screening programme cancer research uk is working to get even more people into screening programmes and to encourage everyone invited to participate
6025742 as well as protecting homes and businesses from the threat of flooding the flood prevention scheme has been designed very much with the environment in mind
6025743 we are committed to enhancing and preserving the natural environment across the 14 project sites to allow flora and fauna to flourish
6025744 in inch park for example landscaping works will encompass a substantial planting programme
6025745 we have been calling for a more sustainable approach to flood management because we see this as an opportunity
6025746 allowing the river to function more naturally will have spin off benefits by helping enhance biodiversity and attract wildlife that in turn brings social and economic benefits
6025747 my mum was buried two weeks ago and the headstone was lying on the ground
6025748 my brother actually had to step over it to lower the coffin i thought it might be something to do with the engraving but we were told by the funeral director it had been knocked off when they were digging the cemetery is denying that and say they are going to charge us
6025749 it will be lying there for about two months i think thats disgraceful
6025750 emotionally it is very distressing we want to take flowers and make it all nice but we cant do that while the stone is lying on the ground
6025751 the stone was laid flat because there was a health and safety issue it wasnt secure on its foundations so it wasnt safe
6025752 the family are talking about an additional inscription it will take six weeks to do the inscription and repairs they dont have to come to us to have that work done if they find someone who can do it quicker we certainly have no problem with that
6025753 british standards regulations have been brought in since the family got the stone which state headstones should be secured to their foundations by metal dowels if this is done they shouldnt have a problem with the stone again
6025754 i am deeply concerned that this family seems to have been dealt with in such a perfunctory manner at a time of such grief
6025755 it has just been badly handled whatever the technicalities there is a moral obligation for the cemetery to make sure the headstone is where it should be in time for the funeral
6025756 even though it is encouraging that criminal convictions are being obtained the fines are in no way comparable for those handed out in england
6025757 i knew what i was doing was wrong i know i shouldnt have done it and i have owned up the only thing i would say in my defence was that at the time i was recovering from back surgery and had huge difficulties walking for a while i did inquire about getting my own badge but the bureaucracy involved meant i would not have had it in time for when i needed it
6025758 an increase in fines in scotland would ensure that the punishment adequately fits the crime
6025759 it is a travesty that people are fined so little for blue badge fraud it is frankly an insult to genuinely disabled people
6025760 it has gone on to be very successful for the group and we see it as a flagship development
6025761 in normal circumstances that would have happened but the credit crunch has meant a tightening of speculative developments overall and we are therefore seeking a pre let so that construction on the first phase can begin
6025762 contract negotiations have greatly reduced the additional costs this is the result of hard work from both sides and demonstrates the close partnership between ourselves and axiom
6025763 all of the new schools will provide a wonderful learning environment
6025764 i hope it will mean the money saved will go back into school buildings
6025765 in one sense it doesnt seem ideal that they are using old furniture but if its of a reasonable standard and in good condition i think anybody would say lets reuse and recycle rather than just throw it on the tip
6025766 i was out for a walk with my boyfriend and his parents and just heard a noise ive got two cats so i recognised the sound of a distressed cat we were trying to work out where it was coming from and to be honest we were walking about making meowing noises
6025767 when we saw him in a kind of hole in the dock clinging on to the wall we tried to call the scottish spca or find someone with a boat to get him out but in the end we called the fire brigade
6025768 i hadnt seen him all night so he must have been out there for a good ten to 15 hours if that girl hadnt heard him cry he could be dead
6025769 i think there were about four fire engines out ive had teddy 13 years thats most of my adult life and hes like a son to me im so grateful to them
6025770 normally we wouldnt attend something like a cat stuck up a tree generally if they can get themselves up there then can get themselves back down
6025771 but in this instance the cat appeared to be physically trapped
6025772 when i saw the fire engines and the guys in the water i thought they must be pulling out a body but then i saw them lift out a little black cat
6025773 hes fine now the water is filthy but the sspca cleaned him up particularly well
6025774 the wound is a very significant one which runs from the left side of his mouth to his ear
6025775 there is a possibility that the attacker believed the victim had been with another group but weve not been able to establish a motive
6025776 the suspects may have been in the area 20 minutes before the attack hanging around the pizza express in deanhaugh street
6025777 this is a sickening unprovoked assault which is made all the worse when you consider it was carried out by a young boy in the company of older people
6025778 the disparaging remarks about oxgangs are a disgraceful slur on an area undergoing tremendous regeneration
6025779 there is a real sense of community here with most residents striving to do the best for their area supposedly humorous pieces such as this completely misrepresent the oxgangs i know
6025780 i would be quite happy to show andrew clover around oxgangs even though he is meant to be a comedian the joke will ultimately be on him
6025781 this sighting confirms that she arrived safe and well in the city centre of her own volition
6025782 we would therefore ask mary to get in contact with police if she has decided to obtain accommodation in the area the family are extremely concerned about her health
6025783 he has died doing a job he loved his family and the army were his life he will be forever missed by his wife children and family
6025784 we thought it was so big how are we ever going to fill it
6025785 people are demanding a lot more out of their mosques
6025786 right now the biggest challenge we are facing is education for the younger generation so a lot of the current activities and building projects have that as a prime objective
6025787 its very haphazard and distracting we put curtains up but curtains dont keep out the noise
6025788 it all depends on whether the community needs a full time school or not
6025789 i can remember running around the mudpiles at the construction site
6025790 the muslim community came under tremendous scrutiny and some people wanted to locate next to a safe haven mosque
6025791 the expansion project is anticipated to transform iscj into an integrated islamic institution that will be viewed as a symbol of muslim unity strength and stature in north america
6025792 now people are participating in township affairs and theyre interacting with other faith groups
6025793 to me all of this says more about america than it does about the mosque
6025794 it shows this country is tolerant and willing to embrace newcomers its the best country on the face of the earth
6025795 we thought it was so big how are we ever going to fill it
6025796 people are demanding a lot more out of their mosques
6025797 right now the biggest challenge we are facing is education for the younger generation so a lot of the current activities and building projects have that as a prime objective
6025798 its very haphazard and distracting we put curtains up but curtains dont keep out the noise
6025799 with equipment prices falling and the choice of content increasing this is shaping up to be a big year for hd almost half a million homes are already enjoying sky hd and were excited to be offering even more hd content to our customers
6025800 these measures are a crucial step forward and should help clamp down on sex tourism
6025801 i am a bit concerned about the caltongate development i saw for myself the site of the development during my tour and was told not to worry too much about the the impact it will have but the big concern will be how it affects the historic skyline
6025802 we can find no evidence to back up the line about a drop in us visitors to edinburgh
6025803 the latest figures released by ons are for the uk as a whole and are not broken down to scotland or places within scotland the latest scotland level data is for jan march 08 and shows growth in visits from north america however we always say to be cautious about just one quarters figures
6025804 there has been flooding in broxburn bathgate livingston and linlithgow
6025805 worst affected was broxburn with 40 properties flooded after the brox burn burst its banks
6025806 its been a brilliant five years and we look forward to continuing to develop the service in future
6025807 we all feel privileged that weve been able to build really strong relationships with our children young people and their families so that families feel they can safely leave their children in our care
6025808 how many children with sight loss will be going back to school this week unsure whether they will be able to take part in the same lessons as their classmates how many might have to wait days even weeks before they get the educational material they need in a format they can access
6025809 we believe all children should have the right to educational material at the same time as their peers that is why we are calling on local authorities and the scottish government to find a more efficient way to bridge this gap
6025810 today is an exciting day for the college to mark the occasion in 100 days time when we will open our doors to students for the first time were giving local people the chance to win one of 200 prizes which can all be redeemed within the colleges new facilities

6025830 the relevance of fashion photography as a source for the study of womens modernity in germany between the wars as it focuses on the work of a fascinating and prolific professional photographer of the late 1920s and early 1930s else neul nder simon known by her artistic name yva
6025831 yva discovered her own unique visual language somewhere between the commercial clich s and the modernist idioms of her time as a successful professional photographer she continuously searched for an image of the woman in fashion and advertisement photography that was not reductive and degrading in an era when images of the woman as a sexual symbol were dominating mass media and were proven to attract customers yva positioned her photographed female model in a way that did not diminish her to a mere eye catcher for the male spectator
6025832 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6025833 there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed
6025834 certainly there is no limit to taxation if the benefits derived from public services by society measure up to the cost in taxation which they have to pay
6025835 it is a fallacy to say that there is this limit and it is a fallacy to rely mainly on individual free enterprise to get the savings
6025836 tax laws that restore some balance to the distribution of the nations wealth
6025837 if left to the individual consolidation will take a long time to come we have to look at priorities in terms of what is good for society and on this basis we may find it necessary to force people to do things they would not do otherwise
6025838 the government should restrict the size of farms that can be owned by one individual throughout the country
6025839 one who has read marx cannot fail to see that corporations are not only what marx referred to as the advanced stage of capitalism
6025840 but marx even called it finance capitalism by which a few would control the finances of so many and through this have not only economic power but political power as well
6025841 i did feel that there was something to prove to my father
6025842 word got back to kenyatta that the old man was a troublemaker and he was called in to see the president
6025843 went to hear kwame toure formerly stokely carmichael of sncc and black power fame speak at columbia
6025844 obama il politico con la personalit pi sdoppiata che ci sia
6025845 obama ha scritto brooks la creatura politica pi efficace che si sia vista in decenni
6025846 il sistema datato ma il senatore obama aveva detto che lavrebbe accettato se il suo oppositore avesse fatto lo stesso quindi per questo merita di essere bocciato
6025847 queste elezioni saranno ricordate per la prima donna che ha conteso la candidatura fino allultimo e per il primo afroamericano nominato alla presidenza
6025848 sarebbe una vergogna se passasse alla storia anche per essere lanno in cui il finanziamento pubblico morto
6025849 nemmeno 85 milioni di dollari sono stati sufficienti a barack obama per mantenere la sua promessa
6025850 obama non ha abbandonato la sua promessa di accettare i soldi pubblici per le elezioni generali perch nel suo interesse certo che no non il primo candidato che dai tempi del watergate guider una campagna interamente alimentata dai soldi privati perch sar in grado di raccogliere molto pi degli 85 milioni che avrebbe preso se fosse rimasto fedele alla sua promessa cosa che ora anche il suo avversario john mccain dovr fare no il signor obama almeno cos vuol farci credere ha rinunciato ai soldi perch davvero impegnato a favore del finanziamento pubblico
6025851 obama aveva lopportunit di dimostrare di essere davvero un politico diverso capace di mettere i principi e le promesse davanti ai calcoli politici
6025852 i politici fanno ci che i politici hanno bisogno di fare ma quando lo fanno dovrebbero per risparmiarci le auto congratulatorie pacche sulle spalle
6025853 non ci spingiamo fino a dire che mccain merita di perdere le elezioni ma se perde perch resta fedele alle restrizioni di una campagna finanziata dai contribuenti il suo dessert conterr un elemento di giustizia

6025861 but i dont think im pitching as bad as its made out to be
6025862 ive pitched plenty of winnable games and pitched plenty of losable games during that stretch
6025863 the first half i came away with a lot of victories pitching the same way that i have this half
6025864 sometimes i get caught up in trying not to make a mistake because one can make the difference right now
6025865 thats the reality of the situation i know theres not a lot of room for error
6025866 we win as a team and lose as a team i felt i was very capable of winning some of the games i havent won and vice versa in the first half i was very capable of losing some of those games
6025867 he got that one up that and the curveball to bourn was up too thats all his stuff is the same just two pitches thats baseball
6025868 good morning twittertown whos got the coffee iv for me
6025869 were just not playing good baseball right now thats the bottom line
6025870 its like april were not pitching were not playing good defense were not getting timely hitting its a team thing were not playing well as a group
6025871 i do know were not executing pitches the way we should
6025872 padilla wanted that slider to joyce to be on the back foot and it didnt get there hes not a young kid thats just not executing pitches
6025873 josh rupe came in and shut it down after madrigal so maybe ive got to take the blame for bringing in the wrong guy
6025874 it was a little special im not going to say no
6025875 its special because you know the other team you got traded from i proved to myself that i can pitch in the big leagues

6025881 mr rasool will primarily concentrate on advising the minister on his work in parliament while dr mbatha will concentrate on other aspects of the ministers work including liaison with anc headquarters luthuli house
6025882 the anc had effectively booted the man out of office less than a month ago on the grounds that he had failed in his duties
6025883 once again we witness somebody who has failed at governing being rewarded with promotion it makes no sense
6025884 there is simply no difference between the so called new anc and the mbeki era anc
6025885 indeed when it comes to cronyism we can see no difference between them and the erstwhile national party regime
6025886 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like
6025887 it is nonetheless a system that establishes firmly again and reaffirms our cooperation and relationship with poland it will deepen our defence cooperation and it will deepen our ability to deal with threats
6025888 achieved the basic aims that mean poland and the united states are more secure
6025889 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
6025890 no one can dictate to poland what it should do thats in the past
6025891 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
6025892 no one should be afraid of the shield if they have good intentions towards us or the rest of the west
6025893 the fdas assessment relies on just two studies which were funded by the american chemistry council acc this ignores dozens of other studies done by independent scientists which have found evidence of health consequences
6025894 the chemical industrys efforts to hide or misrepresent the hazards of its product have been so blatant that congress has felt the need to intervene
6025895 since the regulators are asleep at the wheel ive introduced legislation to ban bpa in all food and beverage containers and will continue to work to ensure that it is enacted into law
6025896 there is clear credible evidence in the growing number of scientific studies that link bisphenol a to the very health effects we see on the rise today
6025897 the profits keep growing for dow chemical and other petrochemical companies in the acc
6025898 were demanding public health be of greater importance than the wealth of these corporations
6025899 the federal governments failure to prevent harm for american citizens is unacceptable when will government learn to err on the side of caution instead of risk equations

6025932 todays automobiles are really computers on wheels with more than 3 000 interactive parts operating as a complex system the more you know about your machine the better you can reduce fuel use and co2 emissions
6025933 consumers who are better aware of the operations of their vehicle will be rewarded by saving money at the gas pump and reducing co2 emissions working together we can substantially reduce co2 emissions and fuel use one ecodriver at a time
6025934 were all in this together so theres a role for each one of us to play in being a part of the solution to these critical issues
6025935 automakers are aggressively developing and introducing new technologies but it takes 15 years or more for these technologies to become widespread on the road ecodriving helps consumers reduce carbon dioxide emissions today
6025936 fuhr ich ein bisschen motocross aber ich brach mir zu oft die beine dann fing ich mit dem kartfahren an und es ging bei den autos weiter aber ich hatte immer ein faible f r motorr der und bin immer noch erstaunt dar ber was diese jungs auf zwei r dern auff hren als fan finde ich die show der motogp einfach fantastisch
6025937 wir reden uns in der formel 1 immer ein dass eine ffnung nicht funktionieren w rde aber hier funktioniert es ja ganz offensichtlich die leute k nnen sich frei bewegen die fahrer k nnen ihre sachen erledigen die teams k nnen ihre arbeit machen f r die motogp sponsoren ist das nat rlich sehr attraktiv
6025938 dont worry well be home soon be a good boy
6025939 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
6025940 while gas and food prices are increasing and home values are declining the rise in health care costs is surpassing income growth and fewer people have adequate insurance as a result working people are struggling to pay their bills and accruing medical debt
6025941 the current economic slowdown makes it even more urgent for a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance a high priority in 2009 to ensure that no american suffers financial hardship as a result of serious illness
6025942 welcome to chilo a planet with corrosive rain crushing pressure and deadly heat fortunately fourteen year old timas lives in one of the domed cities that float 100 000 feet above the surface circling near the edge of a monstrous perpetual storm above the acidic clouds the temperature and pressure are normal but to make a living timas like many other young men is lowered to the surface in an armored suit to scavenge what he can timass life is turned upside down when a strange man crash lands on the city the newcomer is fleeing an alien intelligence intent on invading the planet and discovering the secret hidden deep inside the perpetual storm a secret that could lead to interplanetary war
6025943 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us
6025944 the heroes of this great artistic labor tend to be semimonastic intro verts who like woods beloved henry james and gustave flaubert toil with the doors shut and locked in soundproof splendid isolation attentive to the subtle frictions among nouns and adjectival phrases
6025945 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
6025946 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
6025947 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
6025948 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6025949 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
6025950 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
6025951 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
6025952 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent
6025953 it is a bold historian who writes a history of the caucasus as events of the past week have made all too clear
6025954 when he leads the only major european party that works with the kremlin in the council of europe
6025955 given the recent events in georgia we do not believe that the current arrangement in the european democrat group in the council of europe parliamentary assembly can continue as it is
6025956 we are already in the process of consulting our partners within the group such as the polish law and justice party and the czech civic democrats about the way forward
6025957 cameron needs to support a common european foreign policy and the mechanism in the lisbon treaty that will achieve this
6025958 putin supports the idea of a europe of a loose grouping of nation states which is also camerons line and which would allow the russians to play one eu member state off against another
6025959 you need to use two or three comparison sites and check directly with providers to get the best quote and remember that cheapest isnt always best its a false economy if you dont get enough cover for your needs or have to pay a huge excess if you claim
6025960 there are various reasons why which may have found quotes differed from site to site for example some comparison sites dont compare as many insurers or products as we do therefore the search results would be different
6025961 in addition there are still some assumptions used by other comparison sites that can mean people get seemingly lower premiums by contrast we ask every question possible to get an accurate premium that we can then guarantee wont change when you go through to the insurer
6025962 moneysupermarket com is the only price comparison website with a clear commitment to customers on how it will behave
6025963 our customer promise makes it clear that our aim is to compare more providers than any other site to list every provider and make clear which ones we dont list and why that the price you see is the price you pay and that you wont get cheaper by going direct
6025964 more than one million customers per month visit confused com for quotations and last year 1 2 million people saved money by using the website
6025965 it would have been very difficult for those customers to have made those savings without using a price comparison site on average customers using confused com saved 208 on car insurance and 193 on home insurance
6025966 our last internal audit found that in 96 of cases customers are offered the same price via confused com as they are when they go direct in the very small number of cases where a discrepancy occurs we bring this to the attention of the insurer and rectify the situation
6025967 every parent thinks their son or daughter is special and we are no different
6025968 adrian touched all who knew him were very proud of all his achievements in tragically such a short time kay and i hope that all adrians good work will be continued by all those who knew and loved him
6025969 adrian was a wonderful colleague and quite simply a brilliant journalist and we shall never forget him
6025970 he showed tremendous strength and courage throughout his illness to raise awareness of bone marrow donation and always conducted himself with dignity and good humour our thoughts are with the family and friends of this hugely inspirational young man
6025971 the courage to share his journey with us the sadness the toughness but especially the funny moments along the way
6025972 he has left the world a better place lives will be saved thanks to him and that is a truly amazing legacy
6025973 in the most precious moments when time was at a premium
6025974 we all knew it was inevitable but adrian managed to keep his blog so honest and upbeat that it almost felt like today would never come
6025975 im personally not religious but do believe that a person lives on by the impact they had on others and being remembered by them
6025976 there is no doubt that more people will go on the bone marrow register because of his work and as a result other people and their families will get a second chance at life the enormous spirit that adrian showed will have a true lasting legacy
6025977 rest in peace adrian no more suffering or illness now

6025995 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
6025996 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
6025997 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up

6026096 this is a moment in history when it is vital for the worlds democracies to stand in solidarity
6026097 it doesnt matter how many they have if they are still not letting food get in without delays
6026098 its important for us as fast as possible to establish some sort of a longer term idp solution

6026104 this team has exhibited a high sense of professionalism and commitment to excel right from their camping in nigeria europe and in china for the competition proper we are proud of them and indeed the entire african country has in them worthy ambassadors
6026105 we have provisionally found that there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports
6026106 this is not the end of the competition commission process

6026108 i want to express the condolences and the pain of the afghan people to the for the loss that they suffered
6026109 the rise in violence is attributed directly to our lack of attention the allies and all of us to the sanctuaries to the training grounds to the financial resources of terrorists and the taliban
6026110 and unless we do that we will continue to suffer
6026111 they would call for a renegotiation and we will not renegotiate we have other options
6026112 it might be a very popular policy here to have an all out eradication
6026113 my policy is to secure and defend in accordance with the law innocent civilians and to preserve the integrity of the republic but not by eradicating people like they are mice

6026124 the technology offers a dual benefit of theft tracing and theft deterrence of stolen assets

6026210 our annual vintage world war i dogfight had just become airborne at the yeager air grounds
6026211 bill jerry and i were flying low above the grandstands so folks could get a good look at us as we began to climb we were suddenly intercepted
6026212 preceded by a flesh rattling hum three ufos descended majestically from the low clouds they were the size of oil tankers and coming in fast
6026213 two ufos quickly cornered bill he looped pushed his stick forward and went into a dive to lose them he almost succeeded
6026214 meanwhile i had troubles of my own a second ufo was firing ray beams at me from its underbelly
6026215 as i glanced behind me i saw that bills cockpit was empty the aliens had abducted him
6026216 his biplane corkscrewed down and smashed into an empty hangar erupting in flames
6026217 im not sure lead would have worked against those big shiny ships but at least we wouldnt have felt so helpless
6026218 i pushed my nose up and headed for a third ufo hovering above i came in directly under the belly gun apparently that was a blind spot
6026219 jerry followed my lead i was looking to ram the alien mother ship kamikaze style before it could hurt anyone on the ground we were betting those ets didnt know that maneuver jerry and i both had chutes we could hit the silk right before impact
6026220 suddenly the struts of our wings and the fabric of our fuselages were buffeted by level five wind shear my heart was in my throat as a shattering sonic boom followed a moment later four air force f 16s were scorching toward the saucers at the speed of sound
6026221 the a squad leader opened fire on the ufos and the other half dozen jets followed the air force was packing some serious heat seekers and gave the aliens a taste of its state of the art missiles
6026222 the ufos immediately retreated straight up the f 16s followed and continued to fire at those chicken yellow extraterrestrials the crowds cheered as our boys gave chase
6026223 incredibly the aliens were so scared they de abducted bill who was standing on the airfield he waved us in as we approached there were tight embraces and back slaps all around as we exited our planes
6026224 i deeply appreciate what the young flyboys did for us but i cant help but wonder if jerry and i couldve taken the ufos by our lonesomes
6026225 maybe those alien space bullies will return next year and well get a chance to find out

6026346 here in laos hills are more in the nature of perpendicular forests when ascending the explorers hauled themselves up by hanging onto the vegetation rather than trust to the hillside they often found it easier to climb a tree travel along one of its topmost branches and with the help of creepers rejoin the precipitous rock face where the roots of another tree invited a repetition of the process

6026397 it has been such a battle for sarah just getting to the games
6026398 she was made homeless on the monday before she went to germany on the thursday to get the a standard time she needed to qualify
6026399 she was sharing a flat in london with her boyfriend when the owners decided they needed it back and kicked them both out
6026400 when she came back her coach lloyd managed to find her a room in a house just two doors down from where dwain chambers lives
6026401 being kicked out and being told she had to get the time again made her so mad and she used that anger in germany to qualify
6026402 i told her before the final to remember that anger and channel that aggression and she did
6026403 i even had to find the 61 for her train ticket from london to loughborough so she could race and get the time she needed but she did it
6026404 i would quite like her to stick her fingers up to uk athletics and run for another country
6026405 the virgin islands wanted her to run for them but she stayed loyal even though they made it so hard for her to get there
6026406 i feel they just didnt want to select her but she worked so hard and put up with so much to get there
6026407 im so proud of my sarah she is an olympic finalist and they can never take that way from her
6026408 ever since she was nine years old she has wanted this and we want to thank all the people who believed in her and supported her along the way there have been many who didnt but this is a big thank you for those who never stopped believing

6026421 what government should be focused on is raising the incomes and the aspirations and the opportunities for the millions of people who are stuck on low incomes and that is where this government has failed not because they are bad people not because they dont have noble ambitions but because their measure which is entirely reliant on the state which is about redistribution has failed failed on their own terms
6026422 our education system is failing to spread opportunity our welfare system is keeping people out of work our tax system makes it extremely difficult for those on low incomes to get off those low incomes because those marginal tax rates are so high
6026423 labour has failed it has created a more unfair society and i think there is a real opportunity for the conservative party now to lead this debate
6026424 we will keep tax credits but we will add to the battle on poverty other things like welfare reform like extending educational opportunity like supporting families and these conservative methods of achieving progressive goals are likely to be far more successful and create a fairer society
6026425 at the moment borrowing is rising and thats a real issue
6026426 the truth is gordon browns old fashioned leftist idea that only the state can guarantee fairness has led to a decade of top down state control policies that have made our country less fair
6026427 first it was change then it was aspiration and earlier this year it was all about government being on your side
6026428 now were told before its even started that the next gordon brown relaunch will be about fairness
6026429 but this latest desperate relaunch will sink just like the others have because under labour britain has become more unfair
6026430 gt mary beth lenzi right leads a discussion on the book beauty shop for rent on august 15 lenzis middle school book club read the book at the same time as seniors from hobie creek senior living in irondequoit and met for a final reception after finishing it to share their perspectives
6026431 we thought they could give us a different perspective of the same book
6026432 we are proud to offer this location and have this
6026433 its a good teen read and tells them a lot about human nature and social issues
6026434 it the book is listed under the category of humor
6026435 but im not entirely sure it fit there its a bittersweet mixture
6026436 they the seniors reminded me of the golden girls they had funny things to add and talked to the girls about what life was like for them
6026437 hopefully this will start a chain reaction and get more seniors involved

6026442 the fact that the internet is free and everybody can just go on the internet and sell his game is not just a given fact a lot of big players who are losing ground in this context are trying to leverage barriers to entry into the market from the offline world into the online world one of these leverages is drm
6026443 our position is that for small and medium content producers it is vital that the internet stays free

6026457 that blowhard needs to close his yap or lose his job
6026458 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6026459 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6026460 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6026461 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6026462 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6026463 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6026464 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
6026465 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
6026466 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
6026467 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
6026468 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
6026469 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6026470 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands

6026472 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
6026473 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
6026474 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
6026475 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
6026476 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
6026477 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
6026478 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
6026479 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
6026480 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
6026481 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
6026482 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
6026483 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
6026484 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
6026485 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
6026486 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
6026487 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
6026488 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
6026489 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
6026490 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
6026491 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
6026492 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
6026493 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
6026494 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
6026495 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6026496 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
6026497 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
6026498 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
6026499 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
6026500 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree

6026503 selama ini belum ada dialog antara purnawirawan warakawuri yang menempati perumahan tersebut dengan tni au ini bertentangan dengan reformasi militer karena fungsi dialog adalah prinsip demokrasi dan ini tak dijalankan tni
6026504 padahal lahan sebesar 17 hektar itu hanya 5 hektar yang digunakan untuk perumahan jika memang kepentingan untuk membangun perumahan bagi tni aktif itu mendesak kan bisa menggunakan sisa lahan dan ini masih bisa dibicarakan antara pihak yang bersengketa
6026505 memang ada dilema dalam masalah ini antara kepentingan anggota tni aktif dan non aktif tapi dialog belum pernah dilakukan dan eksekusi tetap dijalankan apa justru tidak menambah daftar masalah baru

6026511 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6026512 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6026513 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6026514 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6026515 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6026516 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6026517 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6026518 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote

6026526 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6026527 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6026528 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6026529 in this byelection you can tell harper how you really feel
6026530 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
6026531 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
6026532 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
6026533 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
6026534 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
6026535 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
6026536 and dang they must have some ninja communication skills to coordinate between that many teams people
6026537 hey you managed to put a wise crack joke about microsoft and apple in the same post
6026538 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis

6026540 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
6026541 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
6026542 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
6026543 the presentations have typically generated some open discussion about how we can reduce the amount of carbon emissions
6026544 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
6026545 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
6026546 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
6026547 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
6026548 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6026549 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6026550 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6026551 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6026552 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6026553 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6026554 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6026555 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6026556 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6026557 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6026558 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6026559 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6026560 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6026561 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6026562 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6026563 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6026564 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
6026565 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6026566 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6026567 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6026568 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6026569 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6026570 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6026571 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6026572 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
6026573 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
6026574 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
6026575 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
6026576 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6026577 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6026578 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6026579 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6026580 she was a stray but she worked her way up
6026581 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
6026582 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6026583 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6026584 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6026585 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6026586 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6026587 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6026588 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6026589 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6026590 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6026591 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6026592 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6026593 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6026594 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6026595 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6026596 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6026597 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6026598 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6026599 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6026600 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6026601 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6026602 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6026603 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6026604 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6026605 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6026606 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6026607 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6026608 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6026609 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
6026610 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6026611 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6026612 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6026613 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6026614 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6026615 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6026616 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6026617 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6026618 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6026619 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6026620 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6026621 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6026622 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6026623 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6026624 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6026625 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6026626 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6026627 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6026628 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6026629 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6026630 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6026631 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6026632 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6026633 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6026634 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6026635 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6026636 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6026637 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6026638 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
6026639 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
6026640 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
6026641 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
6026642 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
6026643 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
6026644 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
6026645 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
6026646 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
6026647 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
6026648 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
6026649 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6026650 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
6026651 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
6026652 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
6026653 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
6026654 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
6026655 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
6026656 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
6026657 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6026658 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6026659 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
6026660 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6026661 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
6026662 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
6026663 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
6026664 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
6026665 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
6026666 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6026667 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6026668 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
6026669 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
6026670 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
6026671 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
6026672 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
6026673 the west needs to recognize that the free to play model is the future before its too late
6026674 the free to play microtransaction and ad supported model has found huge success
6026675 det h r landet har varit gener st mot mig
6026676 i want to vote for somebody thats going to try to put this country on its feet with its own energy
6026677 even though most of us feel the pain of higher gasoline and energy prices colorados one of those states that has a fairly significant energy industry
6026678 n club and much have been sited for over serving and forceful security have these folks been good stewards of the community if we pass this ordinance as is we are rewarding bad behavior
6026679 a new era of diplomatic relations between between syria and lebanon
6026680 suleiman is an officer in the arab syrian army he was murdered in an assassination and the investigation is still ongoing
6026681 because lebanon is an independent sovereign country syria can only deal with the state of lebanon and will not accept claims by any lebanese political parties that say they represent all of lebanon
6026682 all false claims and accusations against syria and lebanon are made from faraway capitals to cover up crimes committed in the service of their foreign policy projects forces of corruption domination and oppression have tried to make lebanon a problem for syria
6026683 president suleimans visit ushers in a new beginning for both countries
6026684 turning sleimans assassination into a media attack on the syrian government
6026685 what saudi politics failed to achieve on the ground against the syrian position of supporting arab resistance it is trying to achieve through the media saudi media is an official arm of saudi government policy which seeks to block syrian attempts at reaching arab consensus on regional issues
6026686 these purges may have created a revenge motive for sleimans assassination
6026687 technical indicators on euro u s dollar suggest that there is potential for a further rise towards 1 4875 1 4900 in the short term
6026688 however looking a bit further ahead there is no doubt that the trend for the euro dollar cross is down
6026689 when they call they keep saying the gas prices its just unbelievable
6026690 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
6026691 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
6026692 i guess i need new socks unless you want to darn them
6026693 i wonder if his corporate sponsors pick up the tab i heard that if he gets gold medal no
6026694 when i saw the nbc story following him around to all his favorite restaurants i had the same thought those bills must be insane
6026695 reportedly on the verge of reviving an 11 year old contract with china worth 1

6026701 the federation has always been supportive of the special constabulary but there is concern that there was a costly campaign a few years back that produced very little only five or six recruits so from a federation point of view its important that the government learns the lessons of previous campaigns on recruitment
6026702 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
6026703 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
6026704 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
6026705 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
6026706 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
6026707 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
6026708 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
6026709 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
6026710 therefore it is simply ridiculous and wrong to try to silence a pastor accusing him of interfering in politics so that he cannot do good to the soul of a member of his flock
6026711 to bear witness to our faith not only in private in our homes but also in our public lives with others in order to bear strong witness to christ

6026716 these results suggest that a portion of corn stover could be harvested for biofuel production without reducing soil organic carbon levels in high yielding systems however since this study did not study the direct impact of stover removal that aspect remains to be evaluated
6026717 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
6026718 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
6026719 im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
6026720 the mechanism of action through which this surgery is successful at improving gerd may be independent of weight loss and needs further examination
6026721 we warned these whores but they did not stop their business said the note left with the bodies of the women one of whom was in her 20s and the other in her 40s police said
6026722 we have sent the bodies for autopsy they were shot dead and the face of one woman was brutally mutilated khan said
6026723 the women appeared to be from middle class families and the relatives of one women have identified her

6026744 these national numbers for chronic lead poisoning are staggering but the percentage of affected children in older urban areas is much much higher than in rural areas or newer cities the blowing soil and dust young children ingest contains large amount of lead from lead paint and leaded gasoline deposited decades ago and from industrial contamination in indianapolis we found high levels of soil contamination many older urban centers have lead poisoning rates that are 5 to10 times the national average
6026745 our review plus the new directions we suggest for remoisturizing soil to prevent blowing of contaminants confirm that our approach to estimating lead burden and its remediation can be done anywhere in the u s where there is a lead concern the environmental protection agency and the u s department of housing and urban have focused their attention on indoor contamination as the direct source of lead to children it is now time to open the door and solve the contaminated soil problem we hope our study will raise awareness and ultimately funding to stop the poisoning of americas children especially those living in older urban areas

6026867 i have few conditions and i have to talk with the other editors on this and my lawyer
6026868 of course there is public condemnation of the cartoon he drew that enraged muslims and triggered protests worldwide by muslims but he should not fear that he will have an unjust trial in jordan
6026869 the cartoonist has the right to defend himself and appoint a lawyer as well
6026870 the judiciary system in jordan is fair and impartial and this is a fact

6026882 kapil dev had presented a proposal according to which the icl wanted to establish an academy and have the stadium for a long period moreover they wanted it urgently while we had an international match coming up india australia odi we could not accept the proposal then
6026883 the ut administration is open to every cricket body that wants to conduct matches at the stadium be it the haryana cricket association the icl or the punjab cricket association but they should adhere to our terms and conditions we will examine the icls proposal if it is found satisfactory icl matches will take place at the stadium
6026884 i am very happy at their response we will draw up the proposal in the next couple of days and if everything goes well you will see the icl conduct its next edition at the stadium this year
6026885 this stadium and the city have always been close to my heart i lived and learnt cricket here it has been my dream to have the icl matches played here i am sure the standard of cricket will improve in the city and the region it will be good for the stadium as many international stars will come and play here

6026890 my initial reaction was terror there you are going oh jesus you cant prepare for something like this it comes as a shock but you just hope for the best and that the treatment cures you and if it doesnt well thats that
6026891 i was upset because i had my beard for so long and when it started falling out i shaved it off i thought i looked like dracula with pointy ears i was first diagnosed october 12 months ago and ive had a lot to go through since then
6026892 it was a terrible blow when it came as time goes on you dont get over these things but you have to try and live with them as best you can and try and live for other people so i am doing the best i can

6026896 i dont know its a killer disease but it wont be me who beats it it will be the surgeons and nurses and the doctors not me
6026897 i havent an idea about how much money it raised yet but im delighted it happened i thought the whole thing was great sitting there watching it being performed on the late late show was absolutely marvellous as well as being extremely gratifying
6026898 mind you i didnt know about the ballad of ronnie drew until bono came out to my house in greystones to play me the song

6026900 i dont know what way theyre going to treat me at the moment its an ongoing thing where you take the treatment and hope for the best
6026901 it is important for me to test players like finnan kilbane given and steven reid i have already said these players are very important for us because they have international experience they give us more safety in games
6026902 the strong teams in the world their midfield players are very very strong they can work they can play they can support the strikers and we need those kinds of players in midfield this is why i think about steven reid
6026903 im going to have cute boobs till im 90 so theres that

6026918 for the medium term i think one could take a look at balrampur chini which has been trading in a downward sloping kind of a band any significant and sustained trade above rs 98 levels is likely to see buying interest coming in as also a short squeeze from the other stocks i am looking at marico industries which is also looking pretty smart it is likely to confirm a breakout above these rs 61 50 62 levels which could actually lead to a positive surprise coming in there
6026919 in midcap space one can take a look at other momentum counters but i think midcap on the whole should not really be assign too much in terms of allocation of funds even for a trader because if it all you are expecting an upmove it will be more in the headline frontline counters it will be in the indices rather than midcap space as a whole

6026922 i think glenmark pharma is appearing interesting although its not exactly a short term punt its more for a medium term to long term investor but it is looking like its consolidated i think it is headed for an upmove and the overall market sentiment remaining buoyant i would not really be surprised to see a 5 7 upmove on this counter
6026923 from the private banking space if at all the market is likely to sustain an upmove

6026961 now that she cant compete in the long jump i suppose blonska will have to make do with the high jump
6026962 the government are absolutely right that the private sector should make good the 100m shortfall in funding competitors for 2012 1 extra on corporation tax should cover it
6026963 to kick or smash with the feet and destroy with the fist
6026964 i am following all this from italy while chopping down a major shrub i fancy a tilt at the lumberjack gold in 2012 start lobbying now please
6026965 i note the beeb have had to find a north american of some description to commentate on the synchro clearly they couldnt find a brit who could do it without cracking up
6026966 am i the only person whos a bit surprised by the dearth of failed drug tests so far have the athletes all decided that they wont get away with it or is the testing a bit rubbish that said as a fan of cycling my idea of what constitutes a lot of failed tests may be slightly inflated
6026967 is moaning about another countrys weather fair game if were going to include it in 2012 what are the rules personally i dont like the heat so im quite happy to have a go at australia if theres any shortage of that at present
6026968 im not sure that bruce jackson has to worry too much about frances potential prowess at cheese rolling surely their cheeses are so runny theyd get stuck in the grass half way down the hill
6026969 that blonska lady grrr if you could have chosen someone to fail a drug test it would have been her
6026970 i have managed to prove that i can compete again
6026971 we apologise for any offense caused earlier today when bryony shaw swore live on air our reporter on the spot rob walker apologised immediately and adrian chiles apologised again when the footage cut back to the studio
6026972 dont be so negative about kelly sothertons chances look on it as one down three to go
6026973 it was great i still cannot believe it were such a small country and we won against a 40 million people country now theres going to be a handball boom in iceland
6026974 its understandable sometimes theres bad weather and you dont want to go driving 20 minutes through the snow when you can watch tv instead
6026975 cut the synchronized swimming and revive its a knockout for 2012 even better lets have its a royal knockout with monarchs from around the world whacking each other with giant foam sticks while balancing on slippery poles above a pool of green slime first one in the gunk gets the guillotine
6026976 i caught his pad but obviously it wasnt hard enough or the judges missed it i thought i had a good chance going into that last round but obviously it didnt go the right way i did well because i was up against the world silver medallist but he was there to be beaten and im a bit gutted that ive lost its great experience for london 2012 but i wanted to go a bit further
6026977 what about scrumping for apples where public school boys line up to sneak tasty golden delicious out of the orchard the last one to get dragged back to the dormitories by the janitor for a good towel whipping is the winner
6026978 played with proper english spellings of course so well always beat the americans
6026979 i think kiss chase is due a welcome return and from what i hear about the antics in the olympic village it could be an interesting one
6026980 in defence of synchronised swimming it did provide one of the greatest sports stories of all time when it was pointed out to the french team prior to the atlanta games that their routine re enacting the holocaust i kid you not might be err a tad tasteless
6026981 synchronised swimming could be replaced by that chasing the cheese down a hill thing although theres always the suspicion that the french might be quite good at that
6026982 i think we should replace the synchronised swimming with morris dancing
6026983 its more or less the same and lets face it most countries other than gb are going to struggle to field a team
6026984 toms tables are impressive but not really water cooler material
6026985 how about number of medals compared to number of media staff in beijing on expenses the bbcs phelpsian numbers may hurt gb there medals compared to drug convictions medals compared to tears shed on podium etc
6026986 if gdp matters then perhaps government funding for olympic teams should matter as well
6026987 the usa is one of the few teams that get zero government funding their funding is entirely private most people dont know this
6026988 hi ive put together a simple page that ranks countries by their medals per capita and also by the gdp medals for each country
6026989 bryony shaw deserves more credit than you have given her
6026990 most of our medals at this olympics have come from the great british pastime of sitting on your arse cycling rowing sailing surely a medal at an activity which requires standing up out of your seat warrants greater appreciation
6026991 while team gb clearly deserves a great big pat on the back for doing so well in beijing im not sure if you understand quite what youre getting yourselves into
6026992 id say youre only a couple of gold away from having an absolute stormer by anyones estimation this runs the huge risk that you lot will go the way of the australian sporting media taking everything far too seriously and oscillating wildly between blind hero worship and vindictive tall poppy bashing with nothing amusing or otherwise in between
6026993 then again two minutes ago they were asking me what the rules were
6026994 unfortunately im in china and the only coverage i have is of the baseball where the score is china 0 17 cuba as im not familiar with this sport could you tell me is this good or bad for china otherwise the other sport covered is trampolining which is something i stopped participating in when i was 14
6026995 the wind has changed direction and that will favour bryony shaw but those pictures were seeing now suggest ive actually got that wrong
6026996 steiner from germany won the heavyweight division 105kg by lifting 258kg in the clean and jerk thats over your head and holding it there for a moment on his last lift
6026997 ill throw this out there of all the things that olympians do this could be the furthest from the average persons ability a lot of things at the games are amazing like swimming 10k but just look at the weight these guys put above their heads the human body spine is not supposed to do that
6026998 good to see the aussie kamakazi lived up to his name by being involved in a crash in his heat of the bmx but i suppose clean run to the finish doesnt make for as snappy a name
6026999 they beat the hell out of grant hackett in the qualification and he ended up being disqualified
6027000 what next subbuteo the 200m scalextric time trial on second thoughts if the world champions a brit lets pad the bmx ing out with lots more categories for 2012 bmx team pursuit bmx individual pursuit bmx madison bmx keirin and bmx
6027001 im wondering if the delay in the 10km medals is because ilchenko may be getting disqualified for the leg pulling incident
6027002 is feet pulling ok then alls fair in love and salt water
6027003 just noticed that according to the bbc live text commentary page medal table gb have 16 golds 0 silver and 0 bronze have we had them taken away from us for boasting
6027004 gregg i cant get to a tv can you tell if any of the open water swimmers are doing the trudgen
6027005 it was the answer to a clue in the times crossword in todays south china morning post
6027006 each country is allowed a maximum of two teams as long as they are ranked in the top 24 in the world at the time of the games there are a number of fairly boring reasons for this rule which would put your already drowsy readers to sleep
6027007 but i would like to mention that there is a very large and impressive list of countries participating in international competitions including a group of plucky brits about the only place it isnt played is the middle east and indian subcontinent which is understandable due to a general aversion to standard beach volleyball gear bikinis and such
6027008 you would have thought that if mr kamakazi was going to go to all the trouble of changing his name that he would at least have spelled kamikaze correctly maybe its like getting an equity card there cant be two people with the same name and there is another bmxer with that name already
6027009 is it me or is the course not challenging enough
6027010 seventeen riders gone so far and no wipe outs it is only a 36 second long course and all riders are separated by just a 0 9 second gap maybe a couple of 30 metre jumps should be included over crocodile infested water that would make things more exciting are there any other suggestions how we could liven this event up
6027011 without wanting to get ahead of myself let me be the first aussie to congratulate you brits on finishing ahead of us on the medal tally its been a super effort
6027012 but im hugely proud of the australian athletes who have as usual punched miles above their weight and to a man and woman conducted themselves brilliantly the fact well finish behind our brothers and sisters in britain for the first time in 20 years is unfortunate but i can guarantee you that like a losing ashes team well be using this to come back stronger than ever
6027013 that morning in hawaii norma could have claimed her ground and said

6027016 its not but its a film that has tremendous international appeal theres an audience for this film beyond india
6027017 its a period film set in 1905 in kolkata its about a child and the telephone invention its a fairytale in fact farhan wanted to make this film immediately after
6027018 zoya has been working on the script since last five years its about the film industry that she has seen since her childhood in the 1970s till now its about a struggling actor farhan akhtar a superstar hrithik roshan a punjabi producer rishi kapoor a junior artiste konkona sen sharma plus a whole lot of stars making special appearances including shahrukh khan
6027019 weve indian films and vipul shook hands only the paper work has to be completed

6027021 and it stars paresh rawal konkona sen sharma javed jaffrey neha dhupia and most probably rahul bose
6027022 do you agree with the decision to build a new football stadium in town
6027023 she was very surprised that we do have a tradition of naming our boats after her movies and she s just really stoked to be part of a team

6027026 im just a woman who fell in love with you nothing more
6027027 when we were in high school i think hes maybe a few years older than me it seemed like the culture was a mixed bag but now doesnt it seem like its just gotten worse and worse
6027028 at the end of the day for us the big deal is to execute and we feel very good about our position in many markets
6027029 the immediate cause of gms distress of course is the surging price of oil which has put a chill on the sale of gas guzzling sport utility vehicles and trucks the companys failure to invest early enough in hybrids is another culprit years of poor car design is another but none of gms management miscues was so damaging to its long term fate as the rich pensions and health care that robbed general motors of its financial flexibility and ultimately of its cash
6027030 what we really need to do is tell people that were back in the car business

6027044 you live in this city long enough you learn to see nothing
6027045 friday night around 11 i was biking home at the intersection of st claude and frenchmen there were two black boys on bikes one looked to be about 16 and the other one no more than 14 they were on low rider new looking bikes one had on a blue baseball cap over sized white t shirt and long blue jean shorts the other one was wearing a dark jersey of some type they said nothing as i rode by them but one of them threw a heavy metallic thing at me and hit me in the spine in between the shoulder blades they laughed and took off i thought it was an isolated incident until i talked with a friend who said that i am the 7th person she has heard of to be attacked in the marigny bywater area they have all reported two boys about the same ages they seem to only be targeting people on bikes one guy was smashed up against the head with a slab of concrete and then they punted his head they did not rob him but i am afraid that someone is going to be killed soon i was not robbed either the intent seemed to be to hurt me and go i reported it to the police although they were less than interested
6027046 as a young kid i was always playing sport i grew up in townsville and played a lot of cricket so i was always throwing i was a fast bowler my dad did athletics he was pretty good as a junior so he took us down to little athletics and i picked up a discus and broke the club record first throw
6027047 yes last throw of the nationals because i havent thrown as well since then i just keep reflecting back on how good it felt im trying to get mentally ready for that same sort of performance
6027048 its been great ive been living in germany and am basically his next door neighbour it works really well its a good relationship we get along really well and its a relaxing environment to train in its really positive uwe is more about being healthy and knowing that if you are you can replicate training and will perform better
6027049 its good having him there because he brings a whole aspect to a training program things i hadnt explored before he brings to my training program hes competed at the highest level and he knows how to do it so you can draw confidence from him as well basically you just have to listen to him and be at your best and youre in with a good chance
6027050 i had a stress fracture in my back and chronic elbow problems so im just trying to keep a happy medium between recovering from the injuries and training to stay in form its getting better
6027051 ive thrown an 84 70m but i havent had the best preparation i was injured during the australian season and had to have a bit of time off but im starting to come back now especially my timing so its just about blending my injuries with coming back into form
6027052 im slowly getting more confident the 84 70m was definitely a boost i know if i can throw that i can throw 89m theres not that much variance in the way you throw those distances
6027053 yes its good its good to have that throw in your head to know that you can do it you can draw confidence from it i know i can replicate it quite easily with the way i throw i know im in shape so its still a high possibility that i can do it
6027054 well youll have to look at it on the bookies sights and see what odds im at i dont know there are a few guys up there who can probably get a medal but its hard to say olympics have been won with 84m before but i think 86m will be in the medals youll just have to wait and see because anything can happen on the day
6027055 its pretty much competition based training short hard efforts and then trying to rest the nervous system and stay fast and explosive not trying to change too much just trying to freshen up and do some fine tuning
6027056 ive had a really good european season so i know im in good shape its really good to come out here and thats a pb for me so im happy
6027057 its just good being here in this atmosphere its amazing out here so im having a great time
6027058 i try and be a good sports man when i come out to these big meets i make sure that everyone knows im here as well
6027059 well our trainings geared around running in championships so the whole emphasis of this year was to be able to go out run the heats the semis and the finals and to be able to keep backing up during my preparations in europe i kept grouping grand prix races together to kind of simulate running whilst being tired as well i think thats the trick for me
6027060 yeah its awesome for australia weve got quite a big depth of 400m boys its gonna be awesome for the 4 x 400m relay as well which is coming later on so im happy for joel
6027061 my dear guests i have a proposition to every man here i will give 1 million or my daughter to the man that can swim across this pool full of alligators and emerge unharmed
6027062 my boy that was incredible fantastic i didnt think it could be done well i must keep my end of the bargain which do you want my daughter or the 1 million
6027063 listen i dont want your money and i dont want your daughter i just want the guy who pushed me in that water
6027064 free baptists took in anybody that wanted to join whether they were baptized or not they had open communion anybody who considered them selves christian were invited to partake in communion service
6027065 the regular baptist had a closed church you couldnt join unless youd been immersed they also had closed communion if you had not been baptized and were not a church member you were asked to leave
6027066 there are 12 of our churches in barrington now and out of those 12 11 were originally free baptist churches yarmouth was another hot bed of them i counted 32 baptist churches and 16 of them were free baptist
6027067 when we initially came into contact we were 200 300 metres apart
6027068 i didnt have any aircraft at the time i ended up calling two guns artillery 155mm guns we got another 60 ana and a platoon of canadian soldiers so we doubled our strength the next morning we pushed forward we were about 75 metres from the enemy compound
6027069 we had to retaliate again and try to figure out another way to get in
6027070 i finally found out how i would react it wasnt that bad i guess i had other things on my mind i wanted to get bullets the other way as fast as possible
6027071 they dont work like us at all its almost like people are in slow motion they do everything on their time
6027072 it was wintertime id say it was around minus five i was cold with all my kit and i saw kids barefoot i will never forget that
6027073 someone has to be there they residents cant do it themselves and opposite to what everyone thinks people dont have the facts of why were there they think were there to kill and that we lose canadian soldiers just because were trying to take over afghanistan thats not it at all we are there to help their government take control of their country you need reconstruction and security for that
6027074 all i hear is the deaths you dont hear the good stories coming back i think thats why a lot of people dont know whats going on over there because all they see are coffins coming home
6027075 at the end of our tour we did a medical outreach we treated over 300 afghans families women and children were doing stuff like that all the time building schools and district centres
6027076 it would be really nice if your suggestion doesnt involve short term and especially long term body modifications like shaving my legs
6027077 yeah im starting to resign myself to the fact that everythings shit
6027078 i was interested to see what it was because ive worked with a team of people involved in monitoring and forecasting aphids those of greenfly and their relatives in this country
6027079 i looked at it with my team and we thought we could identify it down to the level of genus but we had no idea what the species was
6027080 he discovered that it was something that hadnt been described before
6027081 i had thought it would be rather nice to call it mindarus ebayi
6027082 unfortunately using flippant names to describe new species is rather frowned upon these days
6027083 its not uncommon to find insects in amber but im not sure that one has turned up on ebay that has been undiscovered before its a rather unusual route to come by a new species

6027090 ive thrown an 84 70m but i havent had the best preparation i was injured during the australian season and had to have a bit of time off but im starting to come back now especially my timing so its just about blending my injuries with coming back into form
6027091 im slowly getting more confident the 84 70m was definitely a boost i know if i can throw that i can throw 89m theres not that much variance in the way you throw those distances
6027092 yes its good its good to have that throw in your head to know that you can do it you can draw confidence from it i know i can replicate it quite easily with the way i throw i know im in shape so its still a high possibility that i can do it
6027093 well youll have to look at it on the bookies sights and see what odds im at i dont know there are a few guys up there who can probably get a medal but its hard to say olympics have been won with 84m before but i think 86m will be in the medals youll just have to wait and see because anything can happen on the day
6027094 its pretty much competition based training short hard efforts and then trying to rest the nervous system and stay fast and explosive not trying to change too much just trying to freshen up and do some fine tuning

6027099 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6027100 it is nonetheless a system that establishes firmly again and reaffirms our cooperation and relationship with poland it will deepen our defence cooperation and it will deepen our ability to deal with threats
6027101 achieved the basic aims that mean poland and the united states are more secure
6027102 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
6027103 no one can dictate to poland what it should do thats in the past
6027104 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
6027105 no one should be afraid of the shield if they have good intentions towards us or the rest of the west

6027110 i would point my finger in the direction of the tyre issue
6027111 there were also some technical problems that may have influenced performance although in a limited way
6027112 we did not discover in hungary that our car had lost competitiveness in respect of most of the other teams
6027113 i hope that hungary is the turning point of the season since this situation puts me in the position to fight for points rather than for podiums
6027114 lets see if we can be back to where we are supposed to be in valencia
6027115 in the last two races we scored only eight points clearly not enough
6027116 this trend brings us back to the 2007 season conditions which clearly is not the teams goal

6027126 that may indicate theres a group of consumers that see value in wireless data and media and are willing to upgrade their phones to take better advantage of those capabilities

6027175 big issues are at stake by stressing the enormity of the problems the nation faces obama hopes to show americans that he understands how unhappy they are with the countrys direction
6027176 speaking in albuquerque n m monday about equal pay for women obama said that he didnt want his daughters to ever confront a situation where they are disadvantaged because of their gender the thought of it makes my blood boil really
6027177 hes made his attacks even sharper emphasizing the link between mccain and bush and portraying mccain as a poll driven washington insider out of touch with regular people

6027183 but after a little while they get on our nerves never return dvds constantly mooch money and food and increase the tax on capital gains senator obama prefers to avoid that shift in perception he wants to be remembered as being one of the most charismatic and exciting candidates of all time
6027184 this is another example of media bias tilting toward our opponent

6027212 last night was the noisiest night in gori since the bombing ended
6027213 aside from the vehicles moving you could hear fire from automatic weapons and patrolling was intensified they were patrolling in vehicles as well as on foot i suppose they might have been trying to secure their flanks in anticipation of a withdrawal
6027214 we already started leaving a long time ago those russian forces in the south ossetian capital tskhinvali theyre already going back we forces in the gori area entered first so we have to be last to go weve abolished quite a few checkpoints
6027215 while welcoming the fact that the cease fire plan has now been signed by both the russian federation and georgia the un secretary general stressed the need for it to be implemented and for all forces to immediately withdraw as required
6027216 the secretary general has reiterated the importance of respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia
6027217 the position of the russian federation is crystal clear and regrettably the position of some of the councils members is not anymore a secret to anyone
6027218 this is by far a non constructive position and may be a position with a double or even triple bottom meaning
6027219 the people of abkhazia intend to ask the russian leadership to recognize abkhazia
6027220 it isnt fair my friend but it just makes it easier for me to whup him
6027221 you can announce that you wont be running for re election because youd be 76 and you can pick somebody really lame to run with like your pal lieberman that means one term for you and two for me

6027223 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
6027224 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
6027225 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
6027226 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
6027227 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
6027228 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is underway
6027229 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
6027230 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
6027231 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
6027232 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
6027233 the news this week that schools are failing to implement the recommendation from the government taskforce on obesity which states that children should get half an hour of psychical activity should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with p
6027234 another issue is that physical education can have a lesser status in schools due to an overloaded curriculum with the emphasis placed on examinable subjects with the result that pe classes are cancelled more often than other subjects
6027235 according to john carr of the irish national teachers organisation primary school children are only getting about 40 50 minutes of physical education a week

6027240 there are a number of patient records copies of peoples ecgs electro cardiograms details of blood tests and conditions in the past
6027241 i would be pretty cheesed off if they were my records and they had been found in the rubbish
6027242 it was just inside the hallway and it had clearly been left out for someone to take and chuck in the rubbish there had been no attempt whatsoever to hide these records
6027243 it seems the material has some connection with a consultant paediatrician
6027244 obviously it is entirely inappropriate that they should be on view like this in a public place
6027245 it would also be extraordinary if confidential documents of this kind were being taken home by medical or other staff
6027246 we take any issues surrounding mislaid patient information very seriously
6027247 this is warhammer online age of reckoning not lorehammer online age of tabletop

6027249 it is worth noting that this growth is entirely driven by new stores and new shoppers spend levels for existing shoppers remain unchanged and quite low compared with the top four
6027250 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare

6027252 i feel very very fit but i still have a long way to go
6027253 i think that will come with match practice and in the next three weeks i am looking forward to getting back to a certain level that is comparable to where i was in the past
6027254 im just looking forward to taking this step by step and doing these games and then we can see afterwards where things lie

6027266 playing in the fifa world cup is an ambition shared by the entire nation and were looking forward to a full house and vocal support from queenslanders to help the players on the journey to south africa
6027267 we will have to work hard to achieve qualification but playing in the fifa world cup is something every player wants to do and they know what they need to do to get there
6027268 i always speak with my staff and ask different questions
6027269 i had a chat with stuart pearce and ray clemence because i prefer to see both sides of everything
6027270 i could only choose once i knew all the players so it was very important to let people try
6027271 one player might be good another might be not so good i had to look for myself
6027272 you hear little whispers and given the form rio has been in and what manchester united have achieved i did think he would get it
6027273 it was a bit nerve wracking and i was actually standing next to rio when fabio told us all after training
6027274 the first thing he did was turn to me and shake my hand that is a measure of the kind of guy he is
6027275 he is an unbelievable player and provides the sort of an example we can all learn from that
6027276 im very pleased with this game overall im very pleased with the performance
6027277 i know most of the players and in second half brought in some new ones we played very well in the first half but we were broken in the second
6027278 thats normal if you make changes but its good to see all the players in action
6027279 my squad needs to be kept fresh at this stage of this season there are still 11 places up for grabs for our first world cup qualifier against uzbekistan
6027280 benni knows how to hold the ball up and doesnt allow defenders to pass he passes to our midfielders as well
6027281 i hope he will be a regular over the next two years but football is always a surprise
6027282 i wanted him for the previous games but that was not possible we hope hes going to stay with us
6027283 south africa are similar to brazil in the way they play my players treat the ball with love and care
6027284 it is a great team and has been for several years because of the fantastic players there have been here such as ronaldinho rai and jay jay okocha
6027285 this explains why i made such efforts to come here
6027286 it was a magnificent chance for me and i hope to help my team win trophies score goals and play in the champions league next year
6027287 i think the team has enormous potential and i am going to try to bring my qualities my experience and my temperament so that the club can get back to the summit of the league
6027288 at psv i had an absolutely great coach who helped me get the most out of my talents
6027289 with the other clubs my success was more limited although i was still a championship winner in england and turkey
6027290 this is a golden chance for me i am 29 i am at the peak of my career and the next two or three years are going to be vital for me
6027291 the past is the past this is a new start for me and i am going to do my best to succeed i like pressure it inspires me
6027292 clubs like liverpool are always looking round the world for players and there is always going to be someone new challenging you
6027293 it was sudden one day i was a liverpool player the next i was going to leave
6027294 i just wanted to make sure i got the best possible club there was no way i was going to be comfortable playing for another english club and i had plenty of offers from other clubs in the premier league
6027295 i didnt have to leave because i had another year left but i did want to be playing regularly and i didnt feel that would happen this season if i stayed
6027296 i spent seven years at liverpool and played more than 250 games the challenge in italy was the right one for my career and the time was right to change to another country
6027297 of course there are problems between the owners and the manager but hopefully they can resolve those problems and settle down
6027298 he is a fantastic player and a fantastic signing for the club
6027299 i knew he was a liverpool fan from his childhood and this is the best move of all those he has had in his career he could be the reason liverpool will challenge for a title
6027300 over the last couple of years his work rate has really improved and he is difficult to mark because he is always on the move
6027301 they immediately encountered extreme fire and heat conditions and they turned back and launched an external attack
6027302 i was leading through the 500 and basically i could feel where everyone was i knew they would come back at us but once im in control i can push through if i have to
6027303 i know i have a fast finish no matter what
6027304 so im actually getting into the groove of racing day to day
6027305 it is whoevers got it on the day there are some favourites with adam and tim and also eirik for sure

6027308 your strategy will work if it is sharply defined clearly communicated and well understood by employees customers partners and investors
6027309 many customers dont care about a level of quality that goes beyond their needs and desires they wont necessarily reward you for exceeding their expectations they will however punish you severely if you dont meet their expectations you tumble quickly when you fail on execution
6027310 winning companies write down their values in clear forceful language and demonstrate them with concrete actions
6027311 winning companies are convinced that their future rests not on the brilliance of their executives but on the dedication and inventiveness of their middle managers and employees decision making isnt bogged down by a lengthy chain of command so employees are free to create and innovate but such a structure isnt easy to maintain bureaucracy has a way of creeping back into any organization

6027327 whats policy and method of dealing with complaints about harassment
6027328 but what im asking is more hypothetical and informational if there is a set comic con policy on harassment and physical and verbal abuse on con attendees and exhibitors and if so whats the specific procedure by which someone should report it and specifically where should they go
6027329 comic con has zero tolerance for harassment or violence against any of our attendees or exhibitors please report instances to a security guard or the con office in room xxx

6027331 but i know that the first minister rhodri morgan has made arrangements at the end of the month to meet the athletes those who have succeeded and all the members who have competed and i hope to be part of that ceremony
6027332 and i think we should also remember though we celebrate gold medals and so on we should also remember that just to reach the olympics has required a great deal of hard work and sweat
6027333 and that is the important thing to get as many people involved to begin with and from there you also have to support the best
6027334 sometimes people would say we want to pursue excellence at one end and also to get as many people involved at the other end and we shouldnt regard them as competing goals
6027335 but in fact there is a tension i think you have to be careful i suppose where you place the balance
6027336 taking money away certainly from cultural activities but also perhaps from grassroots sporting activities to develop the pitches and facilities that you need in order to train
6027337 he was involved in collecting secret information on russian armed forces its combat readiness as well as data on other servicemen

6027342 policy recommendations for a new administration to advance americas national interests in relations with russia
6027343 i think what we see here confirms my observation that there is widespread disenchantment with the two major party nominees something that has simply not been adequately measured before this poll
6027344 there is a leaderless grass roots movement out there to boycott both mccain and obama in 2008 to make a statement to demand better candidates in the future from better parties this could be a historic election for non participation in a year with no high profile third party alternatives
6027345 it doesnt matter who you vote for all politicians are the same
6027346 the high percentage of americans not voting undecided choosing a third party alternative or planning to write in their own choice in spite of the media saturation coverage of the two man horserace strongly suggests deep voter dissatisfaction with obama and mccain
6027347 new format for bbc one combining cutting edge natural history filming techniques with high entertainment values
6027348 this is an exciting collaboration the first of its kind in the bbc a marriage of two in house centres of excellence responsible for current hits last choir standing and lost land of the jaguar further proof if any were needed that our programme makers will go anywhere to win a commission even to the ends of the earth
6027349 i think it would be the worst mistake that could be made
6027350 that would just accumulate the negative aspects of both candidates
6027351 if you take that 50 who just dont want to vote for clinton and add it to whatever element there might be who dont think obama is white enough or old enough or experienced enough or because hes got a middle name that sounds arab you could have the worst of both worlds

6027364 you know selling china in 2008 is like selling america in 1908 sure lets say the market goes down another 40 so what you look back over 100 years you look back from the beauty of 1928 or even 1938 in the depths of the and there is somebody who bought shares in 1908 he was still a lot better off having not sold in 1908

6027371 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6027372 many people who would never throw for instance a plastic bag on the ground would go ahead and toss a cigarette butt on the ground and step on it and leave it there

6027374 this convention in denver is one is which people well known and people not as well known will come together across party lines across geographic divides because they believe in change
6027375 his message all along is that the ideas have to come from the people

6027386 somebody asked me if i hated the creek now because it killed by bother

6027391 the key functionality of our software is to control any type of internal or local ports or interfaces of the endpoint computer
6027392 every computer being protected but it is completely centrally administered and deployed
6027393 we partner with people for example for encryption we partner with pgp on the software side and on the hardware side we partner with people like lexar media
6027394 we opt for integration with partners and the code is not merged into our products so we will not run afoul of us legislation
6027395 because of this we dont have any problem with us government controls
6027396 in my experience the biggest threat comes from usb devices
6027397 however memory enabled devices such as smart phones are also a growing concern this is because the capacity of personal mobile devices is often the same as usb sticks
6027398 the sales stats are telling us that demand for usb protection is growing
6027399 not just in vertical industries such as financial or military we are seeing large demand from legal healthcare and even municipalities and police departments in the uk the market is growing fast from large enterprises down to smb and other industries
6027400 we do think that flash is the technology being abused
6027401 because it does have a facility to put content into peoples clipboards
6027402 the attackers have somehow managed to insert malicious adverts into the system
6027403 if youre in an instant message conversation with someone and they say heres that link i was talking about youre more likely to believe its legitimate its very cunning
6027404 when i say taking over my clipboard i mean it appears on my clipboard and cant be removed
6027405 whenever i paste thats what gets pasted if i copy something else and then paste whatever i copied isnt actually copied and that string is what gets pasted
6027406 if someone replies to an email they paste from the clipboard and get the url maybe they catch it maybe not likewise with blog posts guestbooks comments facebook etc theyre hoping that when you paste you paste their crap and it gets through

6027414 os motivos alegados n o t m eco na lei
6027415 lamentamos o veto de uma lei que consider vamos ser positiva e encaramos que tem como base concep es conservadoras
6027416 n s bloco de esquerda vot mos a favor da lei e esta era uma lei de algum consenso alargado al m do mais os motivos alegados pelo presidente da rep blica cavaco silva n o t m eco na lei
6027417 a viol ncia dom stica j crime n o tem a ver com a lei do div rcio um crime parte
6027418 o presidente da rep blica sublinha que no m nimo singular que um c njuge que viole sistematicamente os deveres conjugais previstos na lei por exemplo uma situa o de viol ncia dom stica possa de forma unilateral e sem mais obter o div rcio e sobretudo possa da retirar vantagens aos mais diversos n veis incluindo patrimonial
6027419 nada justifica que continuemos a manter este aut ntico calv rio a que os casais est o sujeitos
6027420 o presidente da rep blica decidiu devolver hoje assembleia da rep blica o decreto n 232 x que aprova o regime jur dico do div rcio solicitando que o mesmo seja objecto de nova aprecia o com fundamento na desprotec o do c njuge que se encontre em situa o mais fraca geralmente a mulher bem como dos filhos menores a que na pr tica pode conduzir o diploma conforme explica na mensagem enviada aos deputados

6027424 the beauty of having solar and or wind in the same footprint or near generation such as natural gas powered facilities is you can offset some of the generation from the natural gas facility which does reduce the amount of natural gas you would need to use to generate power
6027425 do gay men lisp in the sense of producing misarticulated
6027426 oh so theres nothing more exciting you can talk about
6027427 the commission risks delaying delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
6027428 this is not good for the uk in any shape or form in the short term even airlines are saying it will not change anything to break up ownership
6027429 airports are individual monopolies selling a monopoly to a new owner will not help protect the consumer
6027430 anyone interested in buying cant possibly put a bid together based on an uncertain regulatory environment
6027431 this will bring new capacity lower prices and better service
6027432 if the public really werent interested in that i can pretty much guarantee the media would not be pursuing that line of inquiry
6027433 if things arent going well doing the same thing over and over again is not going to help you get your business out of the doldrums when the going gets tough there are two things you can do you can reduce your costs to hold the ship up during the storm but more importantly while you are doing that you should do what you can to find new successful and sustainable approaches so that the same thing doesnt happen again
6027434 consider the following few startling examples the top ten jobs that will be in demand in 2010 simply would not have existed in 2000 and the rate of technical information available to people will soon be doubling every 72 hours internet connectivity has completely changed the way people work share ideas and pass on information to operate and be successful in this challenging new world business requires new perspectives new ideas and new models
6027435 the aim is to explore share excite and venture into the unknown in order to help business people arrive at the richest possible solution ultimately it provides the tools to develop sustainable innovation
6027436 this is a message of intolerance and a perfidious scene of ethnic cleansing that was preconceived as a way to drive away people of other ethnicities and religions living in sarajevo
6027437 this is a message of intolerance and a perfidious scene of ethnic cleansing that was preconceived as a way to drive away people of other ethnicities and religions living in sarajevo
6027438 it is clear that sarajevo wants to be a greater tehran than the capital city of the islamic republic of iran itself
6027439 hey anyone know whos organising the office 2 0 conference
6027440 i am a bit concerned about the caltongate development i saw for myself the site of the development during my tour and was told not to worry too much about the impact it will have but the big concern will be how it affects the historic skyline
6027441 modern high rises should not be built in historic city centres or in areas where they would have a significant impact
6027442 nothing else should be decided on these schemes until inspectors have visited and reported back
6027443 aus taktischen gr nden machen wir keine ffentliche fahndung aber wir suchen mit allen mitteln weiter
6027444 das ergebnis der b probe liegt aber noch nicht vor
6027445 even i would not presume to say publicly what i know he thought or felt
6027446 theyve got to walk it unapologetically and im sure johnny cash would have been a john mccain supporter if he was still around
6027447 my father not be co opted in this election for either side since he is clearly not here to defend or state his own allegiance
6027448 i knew my father pretty well at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals
6027449 das unternehmen hat das objektive interesse die dinge zu beenden

6027451 na ja so neu und special ist diese news gar nicht
6027452 ich freue mich wirklich au erordentlich dass wir jochen distelmeyer f r columbia berlin als k nstler gewinnen konnten
6027453 no i am not scared everything is working out right now and that makes me really very happy and i personally never had any expectations but just made what i wanted to make
6027454 after all the great reviews from my last album eulogy for evolution progression soulfood it gets very hard as i always want to make the next album better than the last one but now i am starting to think what to write as people are beginning to expect things from me especially people i work with so sometimes i am really scared to send them a demo because they might not like it but i only want to release stuff that i like and i already told them if i like it i release it but i also have to accept that if i want to make a living from my music i have to accept what other people think about my music but of course i would never release anything i dont like
6027455 but all these songs are so different so i dont know if they will all make it to the album i will keep writing and hope to record the album in december or january
6027456 when i get back home i will not do anything for a whole day i will just look at the wall and relax and will not tell anyone i am back home for a couple of days and then i will continue writing songs of course
6027457 i am more of a calvinist than anything else but i use my calvinism in my writings and my preaching as i use this sugar taking a lump and putting it into his tea cup and stirring it adding i do not give it alone and whole but mixed and diluted
6027458 thats wonderful i wish you the very best of luck
6027459 how wonderful that youre having a baby i had one too and it was a really positive experience
6027460 well i had been in labour for 12 hours and was tired by then
6027461 yes were definitely right were always right cant possibly be wrong
6027462 we most conscious sex workers dont like that movie either
6027463 oh you are the italian girl i m crazy for italy porca puttana bella ciao
6027464 love is a time machine up on a silver screen
6027465 forse sono fan del cotechino hanno tutti tratti distintivi non ultima una certa intraprendenza ed eccitazione
6027466 vedi magari tra qualche anno quando torneremo in vacanza a dublino verremo qui
6027467 dont worry if you cant make it to your place you can come back here and come with us
6027468 deal if we cant find the bus or the taxi well rely on your kindness ok
6027469 graphically alone in the dark is a bit of a conundrum
6027470 aaiieyyyyeee i wanna go i want to leave aiayyyyeee i want to go out helppp hellpp i want to go noww
6027471 mit dem stationierungsvertrag haben beide seiten ihr ziel erreicht und das ist ein gro er erfolg f r polen
6027472 die usa werden ihre position als m chtigstes land in der welt weiter ausbauen k nnen und insofern ist dieser 20 august in jeder hinsicht ein tag der zufriedenheit
6027473 niemand kann polen vorschreiben was es zu tun hat das ist vergangenheit jeder einzelne unserer nachbarn muss jetzt verstehen dass unsere nation weder nachgeben wird noch sich einsch chtern l sst
6027474 jeder wei doch dass eine batterie patriot luftabwehrraketen eher eine geste ist
6027475 es ist doch unwahrscheinlich dass uns diese raketen sch tzen k nnen wenn russland sein milit risches potenzial gegen uns richten w rde wir sollten einfach realisten bleiben
6027476 while the grant program had great motives initially to reduce the local tax burden it has not worked out that way
6027477 our position will remain the same on the homeowners tax relief grant we need to keep this grant intact so that georgias homeowners are not affected any further in this current economy
6027478 have never approached it from the standpoint that they have to tighten their belts
6027479 this is politically nuclear for legislators and policymakers and people who want to be elected to office
6027480 but its the facts its true i will defy anyone to refute the statement that its been ineffective in helping to lower property taxes
6027481 it has been a supplement to local governments theyve taken their tax revenues plus the grants and continue to grow their governments
6027482 there is no way we can stick that money in our budget without giving it to taxpayers
6027483 i dont think our spending has been out of line
6027484 he perdue understands clearly the house and the senate and the basic republican philosophy that you dont get rid of tax relief in down times because all that does is depress the economy and you get less money flowing into the government
6027485 i am unequivocally against getting rid of the tax relief
6027486 will mean less money in the hands of politicians and will give back an average of 3 700 to each of 3 4 million workers and taxpayers in massachusetts not just once but every year
6027487 there are tax cut activists around the country who are very interested in what were doing here
6027488 if it does well we may see copycat initiatives in 2010 and 2012 across the country
6027489 dette understreger de st rke v kstudsigter i industrien og for vestas
6027490 tilg ngeligheden til kapital er fortsat solid p kundesiden s vestas ser ingen effekt af kreditkrisen overhovedet som en konsekvens af dette ser vi det h je niveau af forudbetalinger forts tte hvilket yderligere vil forbedre cash flowet
6027491 men efterf lgende ligner en forl ngelse af ptc ordningen det mest sandsynlige scenarium p grund af den store tiltro begge pr sidentkandidater har til vedvarende energi
6027492 det er v rd at notere sig at vestas i syv sammenh ngende kvartaler har haft en arbejdskapital p maksimum 5 pct af hel rsoms tningen og faktisk negativ til tider mens selskabet guider med 10 pct hvilket er hvad vi forsigtigt indregner
6027493 upsiden i vores kursm l kan stige dramatisk mod de 1000 kr hvis den kalkulerede arbejdskapital s nkes til det nuv rende niveau og en anelse mere optimistisk driftsmargin indregnes hvis driftsmarginen holder sig p 11 pct og en arbejdskapital p 5 pct indregnes vil kursm let p aktien stige til 873 kr pr aktie hvis driftsmarginen l gger sig i den h je ende af vestas egen guidance alts 12 pct vil kursm let stige til 970 kr pr aktie
6027494 youll watch what we want you to watch when we want you to watch it
6027495 we contacted mr biscardi who gave us permission to begin an expedited melting process we set up a salamander heater to heat the freezer
6027496 within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head as i was now able to touch it i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section this was yet another ominous sign
6027497 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
6027498 the motives behind this fraud are still unknown at this time it is still unclear why whitton who being a police officer for the clayton county police department in georgia got up before the world and lied and was complicit in a scheme to defraud in a felonious manner
6027499 at this time the victim of this series of deceptions searching for bigfoot inc is seeking justice for themselves and for all the people who were deceived by this deception due to this event peoples lives have been disrupted and many people so wanting vindication about there prior experiences were hurt let us all try to be mindful of such
6027500 ma chi sta matta saluta me e chi lo conosce

6027503 it works in the sense that that other product of baltimore ruth ian works
6027504 it has a certain lets say melodic sound to it this is unlike unitas ian or ripken ian or even poe ian which come across as both unfamiliar and nearly unpronounceable
6027505 one banana two banana three banana four four bananas make a bunch and so do many more
6027506 we often read good stories about patients who are coping with dying but we rarely get to read stories about doctors who are coping with dying patients often these doctors are reticent to reveal their feeling about this important work that is not the case with this story dr bruce cohen is a neurologist at the cleveland clinic who cares for patients fighting tumors cancer cysts and seizures the writer got this man to speak candidly about how losing patients affects him he knows the names of all his patients who have died this is a wonderful inside look beyond the staid doctor profiles written by a journalist with a talent for telling elegant everyday stories
6027507 i dont know if i feel cheated we will find out in a few months
6027508 nearest among the believers are the ones who say we are christians
6027509 god then began to show me that the word of god alone is our standard of judgment in spiritual things that it can be explained only by the holy spirit and that in our day as well as in former times he is the teacher of his people the office of the holy spirit i had not experimentally understood before that time it was my beginning to understand this latter point in particular which had a great effect on me for the lord enabled me to put it to the test of experience by laying aside commentaries and almost every other book and simply reading the word of god and studying it i learned more in a few hours than i had done during a period of several months previously
6027510 no salary for george george mueller had joyfully dedicated his
6027511 at bristol mueller began reading a biography of a great leader of the
6027512 it ill becomes the servant to seek to be rich and great and honoured in that world where his lord was poor and mean and despised
6027513 faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear
6027514 dear brother mueller im writing this because i am so weak in faith
6027515 it is my father let him do as he pleases
6027516 cast thy burden upon the lord and he shall sustain thee
6027517 oh i shall never have the gift of faith mr mueller has got
6027518 we will make you some toast and wrap it up on the counter for you so you dont miss breakfast
6027519 smokers are twice as likely to die as non smokers
6027520 we are now at a total of 4 133 tests of which 3 292 are urine and 848 are blood tests
6027521 well get to some 4 500 by the end of the games the highest number of testing done in any olympic games as part of our efforts in the fight against doping
6027522 i certainly believe its a positive development the fact that doping systems work and are effective

6027526 we know that it takes time to build a non homophobic tolerant and inclusive society
6027527 major european cities are mainstreaming equality by holding numerous public events including lgbt prides
6027528 unfortunately it is not a practice in two main lithuanian cities which refuse to embrace such an important anti discrimination information campaign

6027723 a business opportunity for us at the time had a requirement for outbound dialling and email
6027724 we considered some hosted service offerings from other vendors to do that alongside smaller telephony products from companies that could provide outbound campaigns but we know how reliable and trustworthy nortel is and that it does what it says it will which ultimately is what matters
6027725 the return on investment comes from the deal that was won on the back of the upgrade we have not done the metrics properly yet but we are much better off in terms of ease of use and staff management
6027726 part of our business is an online tours reservation engine when we have bedded down the email handling and outbound dialling we will look at the web collaboration part of the package
6027727 we have additional agents kept for contingency planning and the platform can scale up to 400 people

6027741 broadband on the move is bringing about a change in consumer behaviour the days of the internet being something for the home are over
6027742 retailers should take advantage of the fact that customers may now have access to the internet while in store and for example use their wifi connections to deliver expert advice via a store intranet channel

6027744 it has been one of the last fields to be affected this time meaning it will be one of the first areas to pick up again when the economy revives no sector is immune from economic fluctuation but any downturn in it is only likely to be temporary because it companies simply cannot survive without it

6027746 fewer than the number of staff employed by a typical medium sized city council in europe
6027747 the commission desperately tries to play down just how many people are now working for the eu they are extremely secretive about the number of people who are working to churn out regulations
6027748 under both labour and the conservatives britain has surrendered so many powers to the european union eu that westminster only generates around 20 of its own laws now
6027749 both parties of government have been guilty of constitutional vandalism the conservatives with maastricht blair with devolution and the lords brown with the lisbon treaty
6027750 on the lords we have scrambled the egg and it cant be unscrambled and we have weakened the commons this policy statement is a real and honest review of interrelated constitutional matters in the end this is about who actually governs us and who controls us

6027754 having put together the list over the past two years we contacted those folks directly

6027756 i feel that we should get some of the listing business not just at national harbor but at woodmore towne centre at glenarden places where there is a public private partnership where county funds are being used
6027757 the idea behind economic development in the county is for other businesses that are in the county to benefit from the project

6027765 in non technical terms the court has held that free licences such as the creative commons licences set conditions on the use of copyrighted work
6027766 when you violate the condition the licence disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer
6027767 open source is a large movement and this is one relatively minor license among many different open source licenses so even if the ruling had not come it wouldnt have made the open source movement collapse
6027768 but its a nice step forward saying that actually one of the licenses is enforceable which is a good thing
6027769 this shows how successive tory and labour governments have abandoned the supremacy of our parliament to unaccountable brussels bureaucrats with their federal agendas
6027770 residents will be devastated at this uncaring decision which will hurt vulnerable people and our high street shopping centres
6027771 both these post offices serve communities with a high level of elderly people and they will be deeply disappointed that the government has again failed to listen to them

6027773 im now beginning to believe that north cornwall has done its bit it is high time that it was moved to other coasts and other counties the whole thing is meeting government targets ive had enough there will soon be four million where i live its just not on no more in north cornwall
6027774 looking from st breward i can see row tor and the idea of seeing wind turbines above them is terrible
6027775 there are already four wind farms in north cornwall one more at morwenstow has just been passed we already put up 60 per cent in the whole county this would be an enormous addition we think we have done enough it should stop here and this should not be allowed
6027776 we received reports that a lorry carrying a wind turbine part had overturned in llanfair th towards llangernyw

6027787 cargill posted a record financial performance in a year of exceptionally strong commodity demand market turbulence and price risk
6027788 by bringing to bear our business diversity the full capacity of our global assets strong risk management and a significant increase in capital deployed we operated successfully in the most volatile agricultural and energy markets in decades despite tight stocks of many agricultural commodities we maintained reliable supply chains for our customers and created value adding solutions
6027789 over the past two years it has required on average an additional 15 5 billion in total assets to run the company given the persistent turbulence in credit markets cargills adherence to disciplined financial management was a significant element of our performance
6027790 if markets are allowed to work todays prices can spark a supply response from farmers a rekindling of public and private investment in agriculture and in rural infrastructure will drive productivity gains
6027791 cargill people play valuable roles in helping improve the quality of local agriculture in providing farmers with access to world markets and in managing basic and value adding food processing facilities
6027792 this generates income and investment flows in rural communities and of key significance today allows food commodities to move from places of surplus to places of need
6027793 we are finding new ways to connect with customers non governmental organizations and academic institutions so that together we can nourish new ideas and possibilities in the complexity that is todays global economy

6027800 while i am not against wind farms per se i am very choosy about where we put them and this is an totally inappropriate place

6027809 has sunk into such economic difficulties that it may be likened to a sinking titanic whose passengers are jumping out in a bid to save their lives
6027810 he was a very outstanding politician who made a great contribution to his countrys development and regional peace and development

6027824 we put him through his paces but the results of the makeover were knockout
6027825 i dont think he could believe what we achieve in such a short space of time
6027826 i felt so tired at the end of the hour it was like id just done 10 rounds in the ring
6027827 it was funny when they gave me the gloves to demolish the wardrobes
6027828 i didnt do it on my first two punches and i thought whats happening im losing it what kind of heavyweight am i
6027829 but the wardrobes collapsed on the next punch and the producer told me afterwards the whole pub shook on my first two punches
6027830 some of these guys have worked together for five years two men can wallpaper a room in an hour

6027833 im a great believer in you reap what you sow and i thought that if i could make a difference to others then why not
6027834 everyone wants to give a little something and that really means a lot
6027835 ive never done anything like this before and its really geared me up towards helping others less fortunate than myself
6027836 the first few days have been tough but its sheer determination thatll get me through it
6027837 i love my profession and i owe everything to it as long as i have strength i will be here

6027843 many of these screen scrapers do not provide consumers with any useful services because consumers know that they will get the lowest fares only on ryanair com thanks to ryanairs lowest fare guarantee
6027844 we are determined to eliminate these illegal practices particularly in cases where passengers are being misled by screen scrapers into paying higher fares unjustified handling fees and hotel and car hire charges that are higher than they otherwise would be on ryanair com
6027845 in all cases this scraping activity is unlawful and in breach of both ryanair coms copyright and terms of use
6027846 this is the first significant award weve ever made for a british national
6027847 we only deal with a handful of cases against british nationals every year
6027848 most of the cases are taken by eastern european nationals who have been treated less favourably in the workplace than their irish counterparts
6027849 were dealing with about 300 cases a year on the basis of race now
6027850 and thats a rise of 106 percent in the last year but complaints by british nationals are very few
6027851 the olympics is the type of spectacle that lends itself to the internet and because work commitments clash with the timing of some of the events a lot of irish people thought they could keep a track of the irish competitors on the rt website
6027852 but were finding out now that we cant access the site and as a result were missing a lot of the events
6027853 every individual countrys rights are protected within their own territory
6027854 you cant broadcast radio television or internet coverage into any other country but your own
6027855 this is an agreement the international olympic committee ioc entered into with the european broadcasting union ebu to protect individual rights holders
6027856 we dont want people trampling on our rights if weve paid the ioc for them and so we block all access to our site from abroad
6027857 the ioc insists on this this is one of the ways they finance the olympic games
6027858 theres a formula applied to each country which takes into account the size of the population and the viewing numbers
6027859 obviously the package would be more expensive in america than britain and cheaper than both in ireland
6027860 if the bbc were going to show events all over the world then no one would pay the ioc for it
6027861 but we have extensive live coverage on the website and wed be directing people towards that
6027862 the soft landing we had anticipated and hoped for has instead been quite rocky
6027863 price reductions are continuing nationally and while there have been reductions in all segments the sharper fall in the price of new houses reflects a more aggressive approach by developers in order to stimulate some market demand
6027864 we cannot forget domestic issues either the market for irish tourists who stay at home is sizeable it grew a massive 60 per cent to 1 55billion in the four years to 2007 unfortunately the economy is in recession retail sales have dropped 6 per cent since the end of last year it is hard to see how growth can be generated from domestic holidaymakers in the short term
6027865 despite the demand and exchange rate problems tourist numbers were fairly resilient in the first five months
6027866 visitors to ireland rose 4 1 per cent compared with the same five months of last year british numbers increased by exactly the same percentage as the total but growth in us visitors lagged somewhat
6027867 people may think it wasnt necessarily the best move but ill completely stand by what i did
6027868 it was a bit of fun i said i wouldnt do zoo or nuts magazines im not a model like that
6027869 i said i would do fhm because thats a high end magazine and id seen established presenters like emma griffiths and fearne cotton do similar shoots
6027870 there are much more famous people in london than me no one really cares about me
6027871 a lot of my friends dont really care theyre too busy with their own lives
6027872 i remember once texting a friend to say oh my god ive just interviewed jon voight on the red carpet and i got one back saying i just delivered a baby it was amazing and i thought ok you win im not going to try and compete with that
6027873 when i was about three my mum went to a tarot card reader and she was told shed have a daughter in television
6027874 mum didnt take it seriously at the time and didnt tell me for a while
6027875 when i got the job on mtv i reminded her
6027876 i knew it wasnt going to be easy especially in ireland because its quite small and its hard to get into television stations
6027877 my plan was to get into radio and learn the craft i worked for east coast radio and then on eamon keanes lunchtime show on newstalk 106 108
6027878 when i heard about the mtv pick me competition i thought thats a bit too good to be true
6027879 i think there is always a plan made out for you but you have to make things happen yourself
6027880 if i hadnt entered this competition i wouldnt be where i am now
6027881 i thought my irishness might be a disadvantage because although my accent isnt that strong people in britain do go youre talking too fast what did you say
6027882 when i interviewed jon voight it was a really hot day and we were on the red carpet for ages so he asked if i was wearing sun cream and told me to be careful
6027883 i have interviewed the pussycat dolls twice so the second time they recognised me
6027884 sienna miller slagged me for saying fillum rather than film because she does an irish accent in the edge of love
6027885 when i met the script that was the funniest interview ever because the minute they start talking we just became really irish and started talking really fast
6027886 i was saying i really miss tea over here because you cant beat a cup of irish tea and then the interview went totally off the point but it worked really well

6027907 i have observed all the local dolphins over a number of years and have watched billie occasionally performing tail walks in the years since her release sometimes in the bow wave of large ships which is an awesome sight
6027908 about 5 years ago another female dolphin called wave began performing the same behavior but does so with much greater regularity than billie a 3rd adult female dolphin has also been seen tail walking
6027909 we cant for the life of us work out why they do it
6027910 were doing systematic observations now to determine if theres something that may trigger it but so far we havent found anything
6027911 this indicates that they do learn from each other which is not a surprise really but it does also seem that they exhibit elements of what in humans we would call cultural behavior
6027912 these are things that groups develop and are passed between individuals and that come to define those groups such as language or dancing and it would seem that among the port river dolphins we may have an incipient tail walking culture
6027913 if tail walking is a true cultural behavior it will gradually spread through the local population probably by being adopted by youngsters
6027914 wdcs will maintain its quiet non invasive observations of these enigmatic animals and continue to document the behavior of these wild free dolphins
6027915 this behavior by the adelaide dolphins demonstrates their intelligence and is even more proof that these animals are unsuitable for confinement in captivity where they are unable to express natural behavior or form normal social groups with other animals

6027920 the mind wandering the quiet travel the overcast and dusk
6027921 one of the things ive noticed as a mom is ive been horrible about making my kids read
6027922 if they read just 15 minutes a night that gets them focused back on their reading skills
6027923 or for kids that arent readers yet parents can make sure they are reading to their children
6027924 slowly move it back every few days work it back earlier by a half hour so its not a huge jolt
6027925 this can really decrease anxiety and gives kids a sense of control
6027926 if you drop them off for the first week and then they start riding the bus they havent gone through the same things other kids do
6027927 life is about problem solving and helping a child understand options teaches them to problem solve what you ultimately want for your child is an independent individual accountable for their actions
6027928 i keep numbers of classmates from the previous year and then my daughter can call them if they havent kept in touch over the summer and find out who might be in her class

6027937 den mest sandsynlige m de hvorp markedet vil genfinde sin ligev gt er ved at lave kreditbegr nsning hvis banker og regulatorer opfordrer til s dan et kreditstop s vil det h jest sandsynligt s tte et nedadg ende pres p boligpriserne
6027938 p det nuv rende stadie argumenterer de fleste kommentatorer for at der ikke er en national boligboble men at der er tydelige tegn p lokale bobler som er sv rere at h ndtere p nationalt plan
6027939 denne gang er boblen ikke isoleret til n bestemt konomi for f rste gang i verdenshistorien er situationen nu at boligmarkedet er helt afg rende for verdens konomien

6027946 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6027947 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
6027948 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
6027949 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
6027950 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
6027951 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
6027952 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
6027953 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
6027954 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry
6027955 i expect its going to be chaotic in here today

6028104 the gist of judo is to find the original characteristic of the man and to personify true freedom of thought and action
6028105 to master an actual technique mental culture should come first acquiring a technique requires a careful modest non mean free and attentive mind in other words a player should do his utmost and nothing less

6028124 i believe that this novel signaling behavior could indicate the owls current reproductive status to potential intruders such as other territorial owls or non breeding floaters
6028125 such marking behavior may have been overlooked in birds and i hope that our story will represent the beginning of new and stimulating explorations on other questions and mechanisms in territoriality and social communication
6028126 faeces may represent an ideal substance for marking because it has a minimal energetic cost to the signaler and can continue to indicate possession of a territory when the owner is occupied in activities other than territorial defense
6028127 to obtain stronger evidence on the intriguing idea that eagle owls use faeces and prey feathers to signal current reproduction
6028128 we will need to perform further experimental studies and behavioral observations that examine whether faeces and feathers provoke specific behavioral reactions and what functional significance these behavioral reactions have

6028180 we need to get together as americans and look at the issue
6028181 i think by doing that 90 percent of that need for abortions would go away and then we can argue about the remaining 10 percent
6028182 we need to have less dependence on foreign oil and drill here
6028183 i still cant believe congress passed a 3 1 trillion budget with no energy plan in it
6028184 the need to drill is one of the worst examples of political grandstanding
6028185 its a drop in the bucket and its not addressing what needs to be done
6028186 the business owners i have talked with are very concerned about sick days being mandated when theyre already offering good plans
6028187 i understand the importance of making sure they dont go to work when ill but instead of forcing employees to have a set number of sick days we need to instead look at getting them better health insurance

6028193 the new low profile modules are more efficient than their predecessors smaller modules use fewer materials which is better for the environment
6028194 the disposal of pcb can cause environmental hazard kingston is proud to introduce the new modules to the market and hopes this small step could help to make our world better
6028195 ich gehe davon aus dass wir aus br ssel keinerlei bedenken erhalten werden
6028196 steve told us he couldnt afford a babysitter but we all rallied around and managed to stump up the cash i am glad we did because he was superb
6028197 its never good to lose on penalties but darren did very well after seeing us again
6028198 we received 4 000 absentee votes in the primary election for november we are looking at 8 000 to 10 000 votes to come in
6028199 we just want everything to run smoothly this is a big event for us
6028200 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
6028201 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
6028202 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
6028203 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
6028204 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
6028205 instructions are being developed and being sent to boards of election across the state to make sure voting is consistent
6028206 there is no question that the huge effort to register and turn out voters at ohio state university is going to have a positive impact on our race
6028207 the stakes for wilmington clinton county this region and our entire state are very high
6028208 the wilmington air park is a priceless asset right here quietly nestled in this community is the largest privately owned airport in the united states
6028209 this is not a republican issue or a democrat issue this is about the people of this community and how we can work together to deal with this situation and save jobs
6028210 todays meeting was very informative and i am hopeful that with the help of the community we can continue to work with dhl officials to come up with a solution that benefits all parties
6028211 todays hearing was an important opportunity to reach out to the wilmington community listen to the concerns of affected workers and their families and share ideas with local and state officials as we work to impact dhls decision
6028212 this is not just a company moving out but its a ripping out of the community
6028213 if it comes down to crunch time theyll bring two shifts in because they know it needs done
6028214 they saw our need was greater than our original assessment
6028215 we didnt have to go to the taxpayers for the money so that was a good thing
6028216 all the things you probably want in a school lab
6028217 with the emphasis on the ohio graduation test we wanted to make sure they have every opportunity to do well
6028218 we want our kids to have hands on experiences thats the way they learn best and how they like to learn
6028219 if there is an incident we can go back and capture the incident on digital video
6028220 everything that was built incorrectly in the original building 35 years ago has been corrected
6028221 ich denke nicht dar ber nach dass ich kein bein habe
6028222 ich bin etwas entt uscht aber ich h tte es nicht besser machen k nnen
6028223 platzte auf so wie wenn du eine tomate auf den boden wirfst

6028226 ich denke nicht einmal dar ber nach dass ich kein bein habe
6028227 guckt man nicht und denkt da ist die natalie mit dem einen bein oder berlegt wo ist denn das andere
6028228 ich denke nicht dar ber nach dass ich kein bein habe
6028229 unfortunately we have had to abandon the rest of the meeting as the track is waterlogged in places and there is no prospect of it drying out
6028230 it is obviously disappointing both for the connections of the horses and the whole team so i am so sorry about that
6028231 its hugely frustrating and to be beaten by the elements is a very humbling experience
6028232 were determined to carry on with our drainage project to help guard against this in the future
6028233 we have had an unbelievable amount of rainfall and the course could just not take any more
6028234 we had a shower this morning and that has just compounded the situation
6028235 we are going to protect our children and our streets
6028236 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
6028237 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
6028238 i am a bit concerned about the caltongate development i saw for myself the site of the development during my tour and was told not to worry too much about the impact it will have but the big concern will be how it affects the historic skyline
6028239 modern high rises should not be built in historic city centres or in areas where they would have a significant impact
6028240 nothing else should be decided on these schemes until inspectors have visited and reported back
6028241 she is totally fine with it we laughed its a great campaign and im very honoured to be part of it
6028242 we love england it is where we are both from and our families are from but were very happy here and things are going so well
6028243 probably you may say that there was no expectation from the people back home and the media too but me and my coach satpal always knew i had a fair chance of winning a medal and im happy i could achieve that
6028244 while it is good not to have that burden of expectation on your shoulder i think we can give even more provided we get better facilities

6028246 it has been my dream to coach a discus thrower that would win at the olympics
6028247 i have always said that i was a better coach than discus thrower i made it to the finals in the olympics in barcelona in 1992 as an athlete and i wish that i had done better in my career
6028248 what do you say when the president of estonia is the first person to call and congratulate you
6028249 it is a big moment for a small country like estonia which only has 1 3 million inhabitants it is also a big moment for me and hopefully icelanders too
6028250 in questo periodo la mia vita piena ho tante cose intorno a me che mi piacciono che mi affascinano sto molto bene da sola e la mia vita senza te meravigliosa

6028279 we will be bringing in people who are in production design costuming transportation construction
6028280 we want to encourage people to come it will be a night of information for transitioning adults and students to better understand the opportunities at the studio
6028281 its to reach out to the community to train them for jobs once the studio opens
6028282 plymouth rock isnt making money off this its to inform educate and put people on the right track to get these jobs if theyre interested
6028283 the 15 programs can directly relate to film and tv production jobs specifically and also jobs on any studio
6028284 a studio is like a small town where you can have dry cleaners landscapers chefs hotel managers even if film and production isnt your interest there are 2 000 jobs that are related well need teachers chefs for restaurants and landscapers for the grounds once we partner and set up a shared curriculum someone in carpentry can come to a sound stage and see a set being built
6028285 these are real employment opportunities for your children in your own town for instance those in plumbing or electronics will have enough credit toward their license that they can obtain entry level positions with us theyll have onsite exposure through the program

6028325 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks like it could be a boomerang storm
6028326 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
6028327 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
6028328 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously

6028331 the mystery behind paris hiltons big boobs has been solved and no it doesnt involve plastic surgery
6028332 there are a number of patient records copies of peoples ecgs electro cardiograms details of blood tests and conditions in the past
6028333 i would be pretty cheesed off if they were my records and they had been found in the rubbish
6028334 it was just inside the hallway and it had clearly been left out for someone to take and chuck in the rubbish there had been no attempt whatsoever to hide these records
6028335 it seems the material has some connection with a consultant paediatrician
6028336 obviously it is entirely inappropriate that they should be on view like this in a public place
6028337 it would also be extraordinary if confidential documents of this kind were being taken home by medical or other staff
6028338 we take any issues surrounding mislaid patient information very seriously
6028339 the market has been pacing up and down at low levels for a long time investors have all been waiting for a chance

6028346 if youre in an instant message conversation with someone and they say heres that link i was talking about youre more likely to believe its legitimate its very cunning
6028347 when i say taking over my clipboard i mean it appears on my clipboard and cant be removed
6028348 whenever i paste thats what gets pasted if i copy something else and then paste whatever i copied isnt actually copied and that string is what gets pasted
6028349 if someone replies to an email they paste from the clipboard and get the url maybe they catch it maybe not likewise with blog posts guestbooks comments facebook theyre hoping that when you paste you paste their crap and it gets through

6028368 personal financial interest behind chretien attack on pms china policy kenney says
6028369 we know we cant drill our way to energy independence
6028370 far more than simply expanding our economic and political resources to keep oil flowing steadily
6028371 weve got to produce our own oil and gas here in our country
6028372 people who are drinking cocoa and eating chocolate are drinking and eating the blood of children
6028373 if we can have our tuna dolphin free we can have our chocolate slave free
6028374 i am pleased with and proud of the enormous progress that has been made toward ending this terrible situation
6028375 the protocol is a serious commitment by the stakeholders to create an historic effort to end child slavery in this industry
6028376 this effort is not just the result of the united states congress though our colleagues in the parliament of great britain have also been working on this issue
6028377 on may 20 2002 the house of commons held what we could call a special order on the specific issue of child slavery in the cocoa fields of west africa
6028378 the protocol is a very good thing it is the first time that an industry has taken social moral and economic responsibility for their entire product chain the anti slavery movement has been seeking such an agreement for 160 years
6028379 in january of this year 2002 the government of ivory coast ratified two important international labour agreements governing child labor conventions 138 and 182 of the ilo
6028380 by becoming signatories to these conventions the government of the ivory coast took a huge step toward implementing responsible labour standards for children within its own border in part because of this step the bush administration in may 2002 granted the ivory coast eligibility status under the african growth and opportunity act
6028381 the problem of child slavery in west africa is as much the responsibility of the governments there as it is our own
6028382 today i am pleased and proud to report that congress is a part of the movement to put an end to one of the most egregious ills in the world today child slavery
6028383 the industry is at risk of missing the upcoming deadline yet again
6028384 the very title of the harkin engel protocol commits the industry to
6028385 for over seven years children have continued to languish in slavery and consumers have waited for untainted chocolate
6028386 it is simply sad that the chocolate manufacturers have redefined the word certification to mean data collection adding
6028387 what industry is currently pursuing under its own definition of certification is not truly certification that there is no abusive child labour
6028388 it is a survey to determine the prevalence of abusive child labour
6028389 how much work can a child really do on a cocoa farm
6028390 if people dont understand how cocoa is being farmed it is easy to believe that children are involved
6028391 aside the farmers and their families if you bring any other person to do their job such person will be resisted
6028392 the child will be disabled for the rest of her life
6028393 mom you always cook good meals for me i am happy thank you
6028394 another nuclear power plant would bring down the price of peoples monthly energy bills
6028395 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6028396 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
6028397 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
6028398 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
6028399 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
6028400 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
6028401 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
6028402 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
6028403 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry
6028404 that makes it bittersweet id have been really upset if shed won gold the penalty you should pay if you take drugs is not to compete at the olympics
6028405 the ioc was very clear in the lead up we would work in concert with all the anti doping bodies
6028406 we feel the deterrent effect plays a part in what we see here the athletes know the ioc means business

6028408 we dont expect to see much change because of the fact that refiner margins never did the normal spring increase and fall decrease that historically has been the case
6028409 we warned these whores but they did not stop their business said the note left with the bodies of the women one of whom was in her 20s and the other in her 40s police said

6028417 i was told at the time that id never shoot my bow again so to be going to the games is amazing

6028419 it is the ultimate sporting achievement to represent your country at that level its an opportunity i never thought id have because of the bow categories and im looking forward to it very much

6028422 a drunk woman is not a master of her pussy
6028423 many of us theologians have been increasingly critical in recent years of popular american eschatology in general and conventional views of hell in particular simply put if we believe that god will ultimately enforce his will by forceful domination and will eternally torture all who resist that domination then torture and domination become not only permissible but in some way godly
6028424 this is what im just concerned about a little bit with some of the things that are going on today
6028425 but my subtle fear is that we dont then swing the pendulum so much that we forget that there is life after we die and that we do have to still remember that there is an eternity with god and an eternity apart from god
6028426 meet the born again criteria plus seven other conditions those include saying their faith is very important in their life today believing they have a personal responsibility to share their religious beliefs about christ with non christians believing that satan exists believing that eternal salvation is possible only through grace not works believing that jesus christ lived a sinless life on earth asserting that the bible is accurate in all that it teaches and describing god as the all knowing all powerful perfect deity who created the universe and still rules it today

6028433 for i am with you to save you declares the lord
6028434 i will discipline you in just measure and i will by no means leave you unpunished
6028435 thus says the lord the people who survived the sword found grace in the wilderness
6028436 but this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days declares the lord i will put my law within them and i will write it on their hearts
6028437 and they shall be my people and i will be their god
6028438 and i will put the fear of me in their hearts that they may not turn from me
6028439 i will cleanse them from all the guilt of their sin against me
6028440 for thus says the lord david shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of israel and the levitical priests shall never lack a man in my presence to offer burnt offerings to burn grain offerings and to make sacrifices forever

6028446 how do you learn to redeem yourself from a mistake how do you learn to overcome that on the inside and continue being a compassionate person
6028447 i think that many people pick up along the way that life is about destination so they are taught it is about arriving its about having all the answers its about creating a nice box that you can sit in and defend but my fundamental understanding is that life is a journey and journey is a fundamentally different way to understand life than destination and on a journey all i am responsible for is the next step and thats all im ever asked for is the next step i dont have to have it all figured out i dont have to defend it all i dont have to have it all nailed down and if you can shift from destination understanding to journey it frees you to take life as it comes let it be what it is and then do the next right thing
6028448 when you dont know where youre going any road will take you there
6028449 is not about the destination but instead it is about the journey and about being

6028453 i encourage you now to throw off your arrogant evil ways and accept jesus as the one and only judge of the world you clearly have not given up judging others as you were commanded to do in matthew 7 1 and thus you clearly have not yet accepted jesus in your heart the outlook for you is very bleak indeed but the good news of the gospel is that its not too late for you
6028454 it will cause real hardship for some people particularly the elderly and those most in need the post office provides access to a wide range of vital services
6028455 i am particularly angry at the so called consultation it was a complete sham as the decision would appear to have already been made
6028456 the people of hemel hempstead are sick to death of sham public consultations consultations it seems are held so that organisations can boast that the public were consulted rather than to actually listen to the views of the people

6028483 we think the timing is perfect for the introduction of this type of gaming in the chinese market and we have the opportunity to be the first to market as professional sports leagues continue to enjoy dramatic growth in china it is only natural for the concept of fantasy pools to develop alongside them we believe the appeal will be very strong given the popularity of gaming and gambling in chinese culture revenue will be generated by our website to administer these fantasy pools and there are huge opportunities for collateral revenue streams for the sale of memorabilia etc management conservatively estimates these revenue streams to topple 10 million dollars in the first few years of operations rather than having to reinvent the wheel we believe that we can learn from the knowledge base already developed in north america and adapt the concepts that resonate most strongly with chinese culture

6028496 there will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears so to speak producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods and this seems to be the final revolution

6028504 i have bumped into a few teachers who havent been happy with me
6028505 they say you know we are not all like that and my answer to that is i know at least three teachers who had affairs with their students when i was at school
6028506 you might not have done it but dont tell me it doesnt happen
6028507 ill probably upset a nation of taxi drivers maybe ill find them more forgiving than teachers
6028508 mostly the public reaction has been fantastic people come up a lot and go oh you horrible git you are a bad lad you are
6028509 but then they go on to say they love the storyline and the great character
6028510 i didnt know anything about this illness at all nor did any of my friends
6028511 but ive found out that around one person in 100 will experience it at some time and so in an average secondary school with 1 000 pupils there are about 10 that could be affected
6028512 that really shocked me and had me thinking maybe i already know someone who could be affected and i dont even realise it
6028513 its really opened my eyes to the suffering that people go through and what a terrible effect this illness can have on someones life
6028514 the chance to play this part came out of the blue

6028536 when people hear the a word they automatically think of abortion but were more than that
6028537 by educating people about the services we provide and the importance of prevention we can prevent the a word from standing for abortion
6028538 if the public works with me that a word will be less and less needed
6028539 this gives me the opportunity to get out there and tell the truth

6028550 the biggest challenge facing a young journalist in todays media is
6028551 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6028552 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6028553 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

6028574 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6028575 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6028576 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6028577 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6028578 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6028579 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6028580 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6028581 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6028582 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6028583 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6028584 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6028585 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6028586 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6028587 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6028588 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6028589 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6028590 best western is proud to welcome the coconut waikiki hotel to our chain

6028594 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6028595 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6028596 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6028597 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6028598 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6028599 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6028600 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6028601 i should have just chucked 75 bucks up in the air and let it blow away
6028602 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6028603 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6028604 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6028605 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6028606 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6028607 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6028608 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6028609 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6028610 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6028611 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6028612 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6028613 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package

6028649 s s goal a minute from the full time whistle ensured that possession after the kick out would be vital and in mayo hands the ball eventually rested the clock counting out the kingdom and signalling a semi final return for the green and red
6028650 s tallied a goal and seven for the day the same score attributed to mayos cora staunton however the contributions of the two full forwards could not have been more contrasting
6028651 s rose her other seven white flags from the dead ball an immense performance by helena lohan superbly restricting kerrys danger girl in general play
6028652 s s converted free having levelled the scores for the briefest of moments
6028653 s free was added to by deidre corridan and patrice dennehy as kerry then rushed a point in front by the 10th minute but mayo responded with a consecutive trio of their own as cafferky staunton and fiona mchale all scored from play between the 17th and 19th minutes mchale then being denied a goal by keeper laoise odriscoll after a spell binding move involving claire egan aoife herbert lisa cafferky marcella heffernan and cora staunton
6028654 s reduced her sides two point arrears by one that was soon made four when staunton displayed the neatest footwork to flat foot three defenders and slide the ball under odriscoll in the 23rd minute wing forwards mchale and herbert were significant instigators of the move
6028655 s frees and a louise n muircheartaigh point increased their tally to 0 8 only for heffernan to brilliantly widen the margin between the teams before the change of ends by squeezing over from top of the right
6028656 s a free got it down to five by the 46th minute whilst frees by dennehy two and
6028657 s s late goal a supreme finish from 13 metres past the outstretched left arm of yvonne byrne luckily for mayo that score provided no more than a scare their good work of earlier just about proving enough

6028660 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6028661 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6028662 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6028663 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6028664 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6028665 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6028666 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

6028673 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6028674 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6028675 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6028676 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

6028683 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6028684 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6028685 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6028686 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6028687 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6028688 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6028689 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6028690 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

6028693 calder n no nos llam para mejorarle el contrato hasta que cristiano ronaldo no anunci que segu a una temporada m s en el manchester eso a robinho le ha dolido mucho y despu s de escuchar tantas veces que ser a traspasado noticia que nunca desminti ning n portavoz del club apareci la oferta irrechazable del chelsea un equipo que por lo que le ofrece s que le valora

6028790 dont be such a fancy lad you fuckin fancy lad
6028791 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
6028792 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
6028793 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
6028794 yeah weve been improving all year but well have to reach a new level of performance and work rate if were going to compete next sunday
6028795 the great thing about this group is that there are no individuals on the team and were all willing to do whats needed to put us in a good position at the end of he game well probably have to play better than weve played all year and well see where that gets us
6028796 i havent really seen kerry playing in the championship their strengths seemingly are their forwards they seem to be exceptional cian tobin barry john keane barry shanahan and barry john walsh the walshs are household names in kerry and have a great pedigree ive been hearing rave reviews about this gutherie lad at midfield as well so by all accounts kerry are a fine team
6028797 we had a very good game with them that day and it was good for our lads to see kerrys style of play and movement for themselves you can tell them about it and explain it but it was great for them to experience it at first hand and that will stand to our lads on sunday
6028798 our backs have done well but they have to do so again next sunday at the other end were going to have to score more thats really the bottom line if we dont improve our positive football and our attacking football for the next day were not going to get enough scores on the board and thats a concern but in saying that we have very good players on our team high quality players and if they play to their potential the next day we have a chance
6028799 im delighted with the way the lads have developed and im delighted that theyve won a connacht title its very important to win championships and grasp opportunities when they arise and days like that will stay with them throughout their careers
6028800 our preparations are going all right were recovering after the quarter final game trying to get the strength back into the lads it was a tough game and we wont know until later in the week how kevin and eoin are
6028801 the decision will be made by our medical team at the end of the day and we can only hope for the best at this stage id hate to think that any lad would miss out on a croke park experience because of injury
6028802 were really looking forward to getting out on the pitch and showing what we can do
6028803 if we can keep them focussed and concentrating on the ball i think thats about the only way we can help them settle into the surroundings
6028804 kerrymen have a reputation for being cute and for keeping their cards firmly pressed against their chests well move over kerry males theres a new sheriff in town and he comes from mayo former mayo star forward of the 90s ray dempsey is the mayo minor football manager and when he spoke to the kingdom this week he wasnt giving too much away affable friendly chatty he certainly knows his stuff
6028805 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6028806 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6028807 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6028808 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6028809 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
6028810 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
6028811 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
6028812 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
6028813 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
6028814 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare
6028815 no single crash test provides a full picture of a vehicles crashworthiness
6028816 i saw him cycling up the hill out of cross when he was a young lad and i knew he was something special
6028817 im very nervous for david i know how much this means to him and im so very proud of him
6028818 well build a velodrome here in cong if he wins
6028819 jill davids sister is after texting she wants to know what the craic is like in lydons
6028820 she says all the irish have gathered together at the edge of the track to roar him on
6028821 im so proud of him but so disappointed for himself
6028822 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6028823 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6028824 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6028825 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6028826 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
6028827 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
6028828 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
6028829 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
6028830 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
6028831 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
6028832 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
6028833 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
6028834 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
6028835 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
6028836 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
6028837 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
6028838 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
6028839 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
6028840 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
6028841 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
6028842 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
6028843 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
6028844 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
6028845 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
6028846 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
6028847 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
6028848 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
6028849 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
6028850 are going to be the biggest releases of delphi and c in many years going back to the delphi 7 time frame
6028851 we think the packaged software industry and the line of business and client server area are very important parts of the software market and delphi and c builder are premier tools for these areas
6028852 weve gone through the products from top to bottom and unicode enabled everything
6028853 our goal as a combined company is to eliminate the development barriers between applications and databases
6028854 this release combines database architecture and design features from er studio with delphi and c builder to create the ultimate database application design and development solution the all new delphi and c builder architect editions
6028855 los pueblos originarios no fueron incluidos en la discusi n de la lge
6028856 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6028857 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6028858 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6028859 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6028860 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6028861 tratamos de producir obras de denuncia claras y provocadoras que hagan reaccionar a la prensa y suscitar esfuerzos de destruccion de la obra por parte de aquellos que no puedan soportarla haciendo mucho ruido y volviendo accesible el mensaje a los que no pertenecen al campo
6028862 hice abundante cosecha de esqueletos y craneos en los cementerios de los indigenas sometidos que vivian en las inmediaciones del azul y en blanca grande
6028863 im not too happy with it but ill be back for 2012
6028864 its to everyone out there that you have to work hard ive been through a lot of ups and downs but ive seen a lot of good things along the way i was able to use the negativism in a good light and say after my accident i can still do it if i work hard
6028865 you have to set dreams set goals and never give up
6028866 i was swimming next to her and she beat me and she has one leg
6028867 when i take my leg off and im completely free in the water
6028868 i find it hard and im a completely able bodied person
6028869 sometimes you feel a bit awkward kind of asking but she told me everything she told me about the accident what happened the rehab
6028870 shes got such courage everyones insecure everyone has insecurities to kind of put that in show and be totally fine with that is totally amazing im going to go and give her a big cuddle
6028871 id even go so far as to award her a separate medal
6028872 i have enormous respect for her it is exceedingly hard just looking at these people inspires you
6028873 i want to do everything on merit this is not just a free ride
6028874 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
6028875 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
6028876 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
6028877 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6028878 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6028879 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6028880 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6028881 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6028882 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6028883 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
6028884 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
6028885 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6028886 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6028887 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6028888 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6028889 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6028890 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6028891 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6028892 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6028893 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6028894 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6028895 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6028896 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6028897 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6028898 el fiscal de la forestal mininco ha estado amedrentando a las comunidades mapuche de chequenco y antinao oblig ndoles a declarar en contra de nosotros que actualmente nos encontramos recluidos en la c rcel de temuco y de angol a muchos mapuche de la comunidad se les est ofreciendo dinero y artefactos como celulares para que declaren y esp en a su propia gente
6028899 at the time of the robberies both premises were open and were quite busy and i would ask anyone who has not yet spoke to police to come forward
6028900 officers are continuing to study cctv footage in an effort to gain more information
6028901 these two robberies are not being linked however enquiries are ongoing to establish if the first robbery is linked to previous robberies in the local area
6028902 we are getting a huge reaction from cyclists who are looking on this two day as a challenge worth taking it takes cyclists on a scenic tour of co mayo and with full back up and support it is a very attractive event
6028903 every year we do a major challenge like this in previous years we have cycled through mayo but this time we are doing a full mayo tour
6028904 cyclists of all abilities are welcome to take part it is particularly aimed at leisure cyclists
6028905 the route has been selected for its scenic beauty with unrivalled views of lakes and the atlantic ocean it will showcase what mayo has to offer as a tourist destination
6028906 from the age of about fourteen or fifteen i would have been travelling to tournaments in dublin and other counties in ireland i never won the under 16s or anything like that so i didnt stand out as a potential superstar i wanted to become a professional though so i was in it for the long haul
6028907 id heard of jason even before the exhbition was organised i try to follow the careers of the up and coming players as i did when david morris now ranked 67 in the world from kilkenny was making his way through the junior scene my youth record is nothing compared to jasons hes been irish u 16 champion won two stars of the future tournaments and even won the junior pot black tournament in sheffield
6028908 but i got on with what needed to be done before i went playing snooker my dad was more supportive of the idea of me turning professional my mam was a bit sceptical
6028909 i remember writing in my homework journal that i wanted to become a professional snooker player so even when i was at school there was always that niggling intuition that snooker would play a part in my future and fortunately it has
6028910 its typical ive been beating him all day in practice and now that it actually counts he takes the frame
6028911 perhaps someday ballina will have a world champion of its own
6028912 as a program manager i am very happy because this shows we have successfully slowed down or controlled the hiv epidemic through prevention care and treatment
6028913 this call may be recorded for quality and training purposes
6028914 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6028915 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6028916 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6028917 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6028918 no passado houve monarcas que foram decapitados ou tiveram que fugir
6028919 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6028920 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6028921 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6028922 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6028923 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6028924 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6028925 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6028926 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6028927 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6028928 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6028929 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6028930 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6028931 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6028932 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6028933 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6028934 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6028935 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6028936 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6028937 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6028938 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6028939 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6028940 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6028941 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6028942 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6028943 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6028944 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6028945 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6028946 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6028947 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6028948 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6028949 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6028950 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6028951 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6028952 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6028953 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6028954 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6028955 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6028956 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6028957 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6028958 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6028959 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6028960 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6028961 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6028962 the situation has been improving quite a lot tension in the area has ceased and we hope that the situation will go back to normal as soon as possible
6028963 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6028964 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6028965 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6028966 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6028967 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6028968 this is a planning took where all things are going
6028969 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6028970 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6028971 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6028972 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6028973 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6028974 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6028975 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6028976 only furthers the isolation of the iranian people from the international community when it engages in this sort of activity
6028977 t hey should refrain from further missile tests if they truly seek to gain the trust of the world
6028978 our hands are always on the trigger and our missiles are ready for launch
6028979 to demonstrate irans capability in hitting its enemies accurately at the early stages of their probable attacks against the islamic republic
6028980 its quite extraordinary youd have to go back to the early 1990s to find a time when there was this level of activity
6028981 it was supposed to bring hamas to its knees but all it did was bring a lot of human suffering which is on our conscience
6028982 so there may be some hardship for some days but we dont know how many
6028983 israel has closed gazas borders and doesnt allow fuel to enter except through nahal oz
6028984 so to close nahal oz is to choke the life out of gaza
6028985 maybe with a future american administration we can talk then of direct negotiations
6028986 this administration doesnt possess a vision or a willingness for a peaceful progress he said
6028987 as far as actual negotiations i would not hold my breath
6028988 we are building all over jerusalem within its municipal borders what people call delays are in fact final stages of coordination with city hall
6028989 we condemn these israeli declarations and once again we ask the israeli government to give peace a chance by stopping all settlement activity
6028990 but obviously theres no doubt that an announcement of that sort would make the palestinians concerned
6028991 is what we forecast would happen which is there are going to be difficult issues that they have to resolve and there was going to be halting progress
6028992 we try to move on forward through those issues which can be resolved perhaps faster than the others
6028993 some other issues are on the agenda but they will be discussed later including the issue of jerusalem
6028994 brown columbia dane racine waukesha and milwaukee counties have unacceptable levels of fine particulate matter in the air or contribute to problems in neighboring areas
6028995 non attainment designations do in fact inhibit business growth and development and thats not good for the state of wisconsin
6028996 we think that sort of burden on the states businesses is unnecessary it would be another thing if the state hadnt been moving forward with regulations that significantly limit air emissions in the state but we have
6028997 take whatever steps are necessary to bring these attacks to an end
6028998 israel is compelled to undertake defensive measures to prevent these repeated qassam rocket barrages
6028999 we cannot allow a situation where our citizens are continuously hounded by terrorist rockets
6029000 any negotiation on the basis of land for peace is a fatal mistake
6029001 it is better for olmert that lieberman leaves now over the talks on core issues rather than leaving following the winograd report
6029002 olmert is sending a message to the labor party that he is serious about talks with the palestinians
6029003 what has been largely a quiet border over three decades
6029004 can no longer assume thats going to be the case in the coming weeks and months
6029005 no one can deny that at the beginning there were some growing pains
6029006 i do believe and the united states believes that the actions and the announcements that are taking place are indeed having a negative effect on the atmosphere for the negotiation and that is not what we want
6029007 i havent heard one but the israelis understand our concerns
6029008 everyone is focusing on the iranian nuclear bomb which doesnt exist but in the meantime the iranians are winning the souls of the people
6029009 they are winning the battle in lebanon and they are winning the battle in palestine through hamas
6029010 an opportunity for the lebanese forces of democracy and freedom and for those in the region that support it to hold hezbollah to account and hopefully to clip its wings a little bit
6029011 we will have to see this is a story very much in progress
6029012 every peaceful nation in the region has an interest in stopping these nations from supporting terrorism
6029013 and every peaceful nation in the region has an interest in opposing irans nuclear weapons ambitions to allow the worlds leading sponsor of terror to gain the worlds deadliest weapon would be an unforgivable betrayal of future generations
6029014 too often in the middle east politics has consisted of one leader in power and the opposition in jail
6029015 the palestinian people will have the homeland they have long dreamed of and deserved a democratic state that is governed by law and respects human rights and rejects terror
6029016 we shouldnt have to wait 60 more years for a palestinian state
6029017 some seem to believe we should negotiate with the terrorists and radicals as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along
6029018 we have heard this foolish delusion before as nazi tanks crossed into poland in 1939 an american senator declared lord if only i could have talked to hitler all of this might have been avoided we have an obligation to call this what it is the false comfort of appeasement which has been repeatedly discredited by history
6029019 we have a protocol around here that we dont criticize the president when he is on foreign soil
6029020 one would think that that would apply to the president that he would not criticize americans when he is on foreign soil i think what the president did in that regard is beneath the dignity of the office of president and unworthy of our representation at that observance in israel
6029021 for this president to leave the country and unleash a political attack on senator obama and the democrats cannot go unanswered were not going to tolerate this swiftboating
6029022 is inconsistent with israels commitments under the road map and does not contribute to an environment supportive of negotiations
6029023 they are destroying all credibility among our people its absolutely undermining everything were trying to do
6029024 decided to pursue the dialogue between them in a serious and continuous way
6029025 i think turkey played a good and useful role in this regard
6029026 israel and turkey have apprised us in the past of these discussions
6029027 we do not believe that peace is likely and we are certain that peace is not sustainable unless a way is found to bring hamas into the discussions in some way
6029028 the present strategy of excluding hamas and excluding syria is just not working
6029029 it was sad to see how hamas is using former president carter to try to get legitimization it does not deserve
6029030 symptomatic of a slow erosion in the boycott of hamas at the international level
6029031 it may be something they wish but they know its a fruitless concept
6029032 ultimate goal is to see israel living in their allocated borders the 1967 borders and a contiguous vital palestinian state alongside
6029033 i dont believe that understandings that will include jerusalem can be reached this year
6029034 but we havent even started to negotiate the issue of jerusalem yet instead of letting the weakest link of the chain destroy the whole process we are proposing that we find a mechanism to deal with jerusalem in 2009
6029035 whoever thinks it is possible to live with 270 000 arabs in jerusalem must take into account that there will be more bulldozers more tractors and more cars carrying out terror attacks
6029036 its coming out now because were getting closer to the endgame
6029037 if there are fresh elections then nothing will happen with the negotiations
6029038 people were running in all directions but he was just driving forward with all his power
6029039 in jerusalem jews and arabs live together and this is a situation that has existed for hundreds of years
6029040 this is the same group that was complaining we were not sending enough fuel now that were sending enough they try to blow the place up
6029041 the day when i believe every child in the middle east can live in peace and live in freedom
6029042 i dont think palestinians believe there is going to be a deal
6029043 and if there is a deal the overwhelming majority dont think it would be favorable to the palestinian position
6029044 everybody supports the two state solution everybody believes there should be negotiations nobody believes anything is going to come of it
6029045 all the reports of dramatic construction projects in the territories are not true
6029046 and its not true that were building in violation of commitments that were made
6029047 its a slap in the face to the political process
6029048 this is the same mistake israel has made since oslo building in the settlements and not understanding that its a sign to the palestinians that israel does not want peace
6029049 it plays into the hands of hamas which says theres no use talking to the israelis because theyll just build more and more
6029050 it was a natural response to israeli crimes in gaza
6029051 we bless this act it wont be the last one
6029052 the people celebrating have exposed themselves for what they really are hateful extremists
6029053 this barbaric and vicious attack on innocent civilians deserves the condemnation of every nation
6029054 a semi military organization of a few thousand men resisted for a few weeks the strongest army in the middle east which enjoyed full air superiority and size and technological advantages
6029055 weve been told that this is going to start and hopefully even be completed in a relatively short period of time
6029056 unfortunately throughout the west bank you have terror cells whether fatah and they present a real and present danger to the public
6029057 if we were to take down the checkpoints in an unthinking way we may get a good headline one day but have a wave of suicide bombings the next
6029058 porque el reino de los cielos es semejante a un padre de familia que sali muy de ma ana a contratar obreros para su vi a habiendo convenido con los obreros en un denario por d a los envi a su vi a

6029064 i have a feeling the life of people in gaza is not going to be easy
6029065 if the bloodshed in gaza and the west bank does not stop there will be similar bloodshed in tel aviv
6029066 the closure of the border crossing points this weekend mean s that an already dire humanitarian situation inevitably will get worse
6029067 the world is a better place without this man in it he was a coldblooded killer a mass murderer and a terrorist responsible for countless innocent lives lost
6029068 he was one of the most dangerous terrorists ever on earth
6029069 with pride and honor we announce the martyrdom of a great resistance leader who joined the procession of martyrs in the islamic resistance
6029070 the martyr may his soul rest in peace has been a target of the zionists for more than 20 years
6029071 he has a ventilator he has an oxygenator he has photo therapy
6029072 they only live on artificial respiration what is going to happen to them
6029073 as far as im concerned gaza residents will walk without gas for their cars because they have a murderous terrorist regime that doesnt let people in southern israel live in peace
6029074 citez moi une chose dun pc quun mac ne saurait faire
6029075 what they are doing is pushing people beyond their limits they are creating a very strong reaction among the people so the people will become more desperate and hard line israel is not securing its own interests by this kind of massive killing
6029076 you cant overstate the importance of the shooting on ashkelon this is a major israeli city that is now being targeted by the rockets
6029077 whenever an ambulance comes close they shoot and it goes away
6029078 they are just a cover for this terrible massacre in gaza

6029093 religious and political affiliation does not impact whether an individual is placed
6029094 we have a problem when a law abiding combat veteran is about to lose his job because the government has placed him on a terrorist watch list but refuses to tell him why
6029095 social entrepreneurs and leading nonprofit organizations that are assisting schools lifting families out of poverty filling health care gaps and inspiring others to lead change in their own communities

6029098 they asked me what i wanted to do and i made it up because i thought im a singer they wont believe me
6029099 i recognised that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
6029100 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
6029101 evident from a large number of factors including its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
6029102 not tailored to the requirements of airport users and lower levels and quality of service for both airlines and passengers
6029103 we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities over time we would expect these to increase significantly
6029104 we take the opposite view unless the market is opened up to competition there is a serious risk that the current capacity constraints will persist certainly for longer than in a better functioning market
6029105 while we accept that government policy and the planning regime have contributed to the lack of capacity we have found that baa as the owner and operator of these london airports has played a major role in not pressing for more capacity sooner
6029106 only be a first step in freeing up the market and providing greater scope for more flexible development

6029110 she is in no condition to drive in the morning i have seen her be drowsy and dizzy with difficulties in co ordination i have warned on numerous occasions to refrain from transporting our children in the car when she is in such a state
6029111 it is ludicrous for her to claim that she is afraid of me i am not a violent or aggressive person
6029112 taking a low position can allow you to feel really close to the athletes
6029113 this is carole peon of france during the swimming portion of the heptathlon event
6029114 in order to take this photograph i had to swim out to a position approximately 300m from the point at which the athletes would leave the water
6029115 we have a problem when a law abiding combat veteran is about to lose his job because the government has placed him on a terrorist watch list but refuses to tell him why
6029116 religious and political affiliation does not impact whether an individual is placed
6029117 so that the meaning is that though according to the estimation of the world the dead suffer destruction in their flesh and are deemed condemned as to the outward man yet they cease not to live with god and that in their spirit because christ quickens them by his spirit
6029118 we ought not to sit still in the world from which we must soon remove
6029119 we do not give our own but only dispense what god has committed to us
6029120 it is as though peter had said whatever part of the burden thou bearest in the church know that thou canst do nothing but what has been given thee by the lord and that thou art nothing else but an instrument of god take heed then not to abuse the grace of god by exalting thyself take heed then not to abuse the grace of god by exalting thyself take heed not to suppress the power of god which puts forth and manifests itself in the ministry for the salvation of the brethren and sistren

6029150 the selection of assistmeds system follows an extensive evaluation of our technology and its features including its web based applications and other capabilities that we demonstrated onsite to showcase the systems functionality as well as favorable feedback from existing users
6029151 this latter capability was particularly important to the evaluators since it minimizes training for physicians and nurses and it enables them to continue using the workflow already familiar to the healthcare professionals

6029192 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one

6029204 for the good of our country i wish he had been right and i had been wrong but that is not what history shows
6029205 a year ago i said that we must take action against bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights and pakistan cannot or will not act
6029206 so for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell sen mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6029207 its not a fact and i have to deal with facts
6029208 i dont want to lurch ahead and use the totality of the reserve based on an estimate only
6029209 we have wait lists for services of tens of thousands of people with developmental disabilities people who need subsidized child care people who need substance abuse services
6029210 rather than do another 4 percent cut we need to be more surgical about where the cuts are
6029211 and i think it was very smart of them to do so
6029212 you dont want to scrape the bottom of the barrel that much
6029213 for a state that has a 66 billion budget 300 million in working capital is very very thin we wouldnt want to go there

6029219 to what extent im not sure maybe about half of it though would be my guess at this time
6029220 its not a fact and i have to deal with facts
6029221 so i dont want to go ahead and lurch ahead and use the totality of the reserve based on an estimate only cause well get a new estimate in november
6029222 its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6029223 i will let no one question my love of country
6029224 lets be clear our troops have completed every mission theyve been given

6029229 we believe that the divine presence is everywhere but beyond the least doubt we should believe this to be especially true when we celebrate the divine office
6029230 stand at the crossroads and look ask for the ancient paths ask where the good way is and walk in it and you will find your souls
6029231 say the words of the ancient prayer and listen for the prayer of god that rises in your heart
6029232 accept the willing tribute of our lips and teach us your ways
6029233 those who have been sent on a journey are not to omit the prescribed hours but to observe them as best as they can not neglecting their measure of service
6029234 let yourselves be build as living stones into a spiritual temple for the holy work of offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god
6029235 the surrendering of ourselves to a life hidden in christ can be nothing other than the participation of our whole being in the work of god
6029236 in the regularity of the office the love of jesus springs up within us we know not how
6029237 the divine hours are prayers of praise offered as a sacrifice of thanksgiving and faith to god to offer them is to assume the office of attendant upon the divine
6029238 there will be days when the office is a burden for you
6029239 is anyone among you in trouble they should turn to prayer is anyone among you in good heart they should sing praises
6029240 let us be attentive to enter into the meaning of liturgical action let us seek to perceive something of the invisible reality of the kingdom
6029241 i started to sense that words not only convey something but are something that words have color depth texture of their own and the power to evoke vastly more than they mean to make things happen inside the one who reads or hears them
6029242 things are so serious now and values so completely cock eyed that it seems to me to be of the highest moment to get even one individual to make one more act of his free will directing it to god in love and faith everything the whole history of our world is hanging on such acts
6029243 to what extent im not sure maybe about half of it though would be my guess at this time
6029244 its not a fact and i have to deal with facts
6029245 so i dont want to go ahead and lurch ahead and use the totality of the reserve based on an estimate only cause well get a new estimate in november
6029246 they can be inaccurate both ways so ill reserve judgment as a result of that inaccuracy

6029260 i understand your question like that there are people in west germany who wish that we mobilize the construction workers of the capital of the gdr to erect a wall yes i am not aware of such intention but that the construction workers of the capital are mainly busy with the construction of homes and that the available man power is used entirely nobody has the intention to build a wall

6029282 full solidarity and full support in its fight against terrorism
6029283 its just another example of the reach of extremists and we would support the government of algeria as best as we can in trying to fight this scourge
6029284 its another reminder of terrorism can hit any place anytime anywhere and we all the international community have to stamp this out because in the end terrorism is a threat to all of us
6029285 currently the hospitals use a standard test to work out how far the cancer has progressed and then they use this to determine the treatment the patient should receive however we are potentially able to more accurately predict who would benefit from chemotherapy
6029286 we now aim to carry out more work in this area to develop a prognostic tool which we hope will eventually be for widespread use by the health services in the treatment of bowel cancer
6029287 we have a very high number of patients with bowel cancer in the north east of england in particular we know the best treatment for very early and very late disease but there are still a lot of unknowns in between these two extremes
6029288 chemotherapy can be very useful but can have a number of side effects so we only want to use it where we think theres a good chance it will help this test will help us determine that
6029289 there is a desperate need for more effective treatments for bowel cancer the problem is identifying which cancers need which treatments this discovery may show us the way to do that and help save a lot of lives
6029290 in a series of eye movement studies we showed that social experience has an impact on how people look at faces specifically we noticed a striking difference in eye movements in westerners and east asian observers we found that westerners tend to look at specific features on an individuals face such as the eyes and mouth whereas east asian observers tend to focus on the nose or the centre of the face which allows a more general view of all the features one possible cause of this could be that direct or excessive eye contact may be considered rude in east asian cultures
6029291 by disproving the long held assumption that face processing is universally achieved we have highlighted that the external environment including the society in which we develop is very influential in basic human mechanisms and caution should be taken when generalising findings to the entire human population

6029295 my friend remained unconvinced until we got the photo onto a computer that evening when the image became clearer and the outline of what could only be described as an angel became distinct
6029296 eerily so far this year four people claim to have seen the angel near the london eye and an internet cult is growing
6029297 these sightings have prompted much online chat about the so called angel of the thames already angel walks are being offered along the waterside and angel t shirts are available one angel obsessive who meets up with other people who have spotted the ghostly figure to share their experiences thinks it must date back to the fire

6029314 on defense we set the tone and the tempo we are really getting some good chemistry we have a tough game ahead but this was an a plus performance all around
6029315 we can just keep putting people on the floor and have no let up at all
6029316 this big push is making people crazy thinking theyre bad moms if they dont get their kids vaccinated
6029317 merck lobbied every opinion leader womens group medical society politicians and went directly to the people it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now
6029318 i would have liked to see it go much slower
6029319 in that time you learn a lot about safety and side effects and how to use it
6029320 those getting it early should be the ones who really want it and willing to accept the risk
6029321 you can only study a vaccine for so long before you license and use it in a population where it has enormous value
6029322 our hope and belief is that this is a remarkable vaccine that will have huge impact on women
6029323 this kind of money could be better used to solve so many other problems in womens health
6029324 some of our provinces are running out of money to provide primary care im not against vaccines but in canada and the u s women are not dying in the streets of cervical cancer
6029325 this initiative was seen as a good use of resources that fits with the governments health priorities and political priorities
6029326 if we do this quickly and badly we could cause more deaths
6029327 when you get a letter saying this is what you need to do to protect your girls of course you do it
6029328 i chose to get vaccinated because my dreams dont include cervical cancer
6029329 i understand that the information i provide will be used by merck or those working on behalf of merck for market research purposes

6029334 the immunity of gardasil will not last that is dangerous to assume
6029335 well worry about whether boosters are needed down the road
6029336 gardasil continues to be safe and effective and its benefits continue to outweigh its risks
6029337 her parents are scientists they know better than to assume gardasil caused her disease
6029338 you inevitably find adverse events that you wouldnt have suspected
6029339 cervical cancer is a worthwhile disease to prevent in a country that has the resources

6029341 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6029342 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6029343 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6029344 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6029345 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board

6029348 the nature of the investigation caused him concern and anxiety in the days leading up to his death
6029349 its the measure of the man i think that he kept it from his family because he didnt wish to cause them any distress or upset
6029350 but it was preying increasingly upon his mind and came to a point when he decided to investigate taking his own life
6029351 the investigator had been there all day on the tuesday and there again on the wednesday

6029358 again this season shows that you should never give up
