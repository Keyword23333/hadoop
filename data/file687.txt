6870022 the more carbs and sugars you eat the more your appetite control cells are damaged and potentially you consume more
6870023 people in the age group of 25 to 50 are most at risk the neurons that tell people in the crucial age range not to over eat are being killed off
6870024 when the stomach is empty it triggers the ghrelin hormone that notifies the brain that we are hungry when we are full a set of neurons known as pomcs kick in
6870025 however free radicals created naturally in the body attack the pomc neurons this process causes the neurons to degenerate overtime affecting our judgement as to when our hunger is satisfied
6870026 a diet rich in carbohydrate and sugar that has become more and more prevalent in modern societies over the last 20 30 years has placed so much strain on our bodies that its leading to premature cell deterioration

6870073 i loved the johnny cash records the edginess the rawness of them but i dont think thats glen
6870074 we went back to what glen loved and what people loved about glen i really wanted to make a record that sounded like those 60 songs
6870075 when i heard those songs for the first time they sounded hip to me and then later i noticed the lyrics were completely different i didnt realize galveston was about vietnam those songs lyrically were way ahead of the pack especially for the era when they were written
6870076 i said the only idea i have is glen campbell
6870077 i picked the ones that i wanted to sing and the rest of it was a piece of cake
6870078 i dont know why im the first person to do this with glen but its long overdue

6870081 one currency moves that far the other currencies follow to an extent
6870082 we have seen strong evidence that economic growth is slowing globally
6870083 a number of economies are slowing sharply that has helped the u s dollar over the past couple weeks
6870084 the events of the previous two weeks strongly suggest that we have seen the cyclical bottom in the u s dollar
6870085 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole last august has not yet subsided
6870086 its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6870087 the initial reaction as far as the dollar is concerned is muted
6870088 he did indicate that the fed is watching developments very very closely they are not taking their eye off the ball
6870089 the markets are looking for a blueprint a battle plan a sense of direction
6870090 if the markets get some sense that the central bank the treasury have their arms around this even if it takes a long time that will be a positive
6870091 the key short term driver for the dollar has really been the oil price
6870092 higher oil prices have significant effect on the u s growth that is the primary reason why oil is bad for the dollar
6870093 the oil and the dollar have moved together but it is not a simple answer as to what is driving what

6870099 the location is great its got more traffic and its not hidden
6870100 if the business owners respect the community they would place it outside of commercial and residential areas into industrial areas
6870101 if you have firewalls in the way what one business is using internally the business right next door to them has no idea whats going on there or what value they might be getting out of it so its really hard for ideas when they do work to spread
6870102 i think also some of the best tools are coming out of companies who arent the established it providers smaller startups who dont have the distribution and the marketing reach necessary to get their story out there
6870103 its been really slow for businesses to discover some of the values of social technology but at the same time a lot of social technology providers have had a tough time marketing to business or even necessarily adopting their products ideally for business as opposed to a consumer environment
6870104 on the consumer side blogs have definitely been here for a while and have been used a lot but on the business side not a lot of companies are doing it i see a lot more companies using blogs internally for maybe their collaboration tools or for their projects but not necessarily externally communicating to their customers or their clients
6870105 blogs and wikis were version 1 0 of web 2 0
6870106 they were like direct lets take a few tools that have worked for wikipedia with the blogosphere and lets just bring them straight into the enterprise i think you have to do a little bit more work than that to make tools that really work in a business environment
6870107 tools that empower employees and let the leadership emerge within organizations is going to be important
6870108 inevitably in organizations youre working on a project that someone was working on three years ago and you just had no idea theres so much reinventing the wheel and so many resources are trapped within peoples heads unless you have some of these social tools to expose knowledge thats out there and get it exchanged you dont necessarily have those rich interactions
6870109 why asking cios about enterprise 2 0 can be like asking dinosaurs about meteorites

6870158 at that point i got pretty upset and i said a joke
6870159 the prank was disgusting but how it was handled is more disgusting i think
6870160 what if they went in there and there were customers and one had a gun and saw a robbery in progress and blew the kids head off theres so many things that could have gone wrong
6870161 had they ruins phoned in reporting a robbery yes thered be a charge

6870180 in my opinion the wtc investigation by nist falls short of expectations by not definitively finding cause by not sufficiently linking recommendations of specificity to cause by not fully invoking all of their authority to seek facts in the investigation and by the guidance of government lawyers to deter rather than develop fact finding

6870195 provides a comprehensive approach covering an abstract model using rdf a definition of basic properties and classes that can be extended and reused by third parties and recommended practices to serialize this abstract model the abstract model separates the concept of license which can be characterized by a number of predefined properties with possible values and so called work properties i e properties that relate a specific work to a specific instance of a license ccrel is firmly rooted in rdf meaning that the various syntax possibilities for ccrel are also bound to possible rdf serializations for x html documents rdfa is the preferred serialization format discontinuing the previous practice of adding rdf xml code as an html comment in the html source and the document gives several examples of how to do that in practice for other document formats usage of grddl direct embedding of rdf data xmp etc are also described the separation of the abstract rdf based model from the specific syntax is rewarded insofar as many different syntaxes become possible depending on the underlying web resource format this is also a major step forward compared to the earlier creative common license recommendations
6870196 the latest versions of the well known creative commons licenses are all instances of license however and therein lies one of the important new features of ccrel by defining those in terms of specific rdf properties third parties can define their own variants of license and combine those with the rest of the general ccrel framework also automation can be built to interpret other licenses that re use the same properties publishers have wide discretion in their choice of syntax so long as the process for extracting the properties is discoverable and tool builders can retrieve the properties of ccrel compliant web pages or embedded documents
6870197 one consequence of ccs limited initial design is that although millions of web pages now include creative commons licenses and metadata there is no uniform extensible way for tool developers to access this metadata and the tools that do exist rely on ad hoc techniques for extracting metadata
6870198 creative commons wants to make it easy for artists and scientists to build upon the works of others when they choose to licensing your work for reuse and finding properly licensed works to reuse should be easy the major goal of the ccrel technological approach is to make it easy to publish and read rights expression data now and in the future when the kinds of licensed items and the data expressed about them goes far beyond what we can imagine today by using rdf ccrel links creative commons to the fast growing rdf data interoperability infrastructure and its extensive developer toolset other data sets can be integrated with ccrel and rdf technologies e g data provenance with digital signatures can eventually benefit ccrel
6870199 the technologies we have selected for ccrel will enable the kind of powerful distributed technological innovation that is characteristic of the internet anyone can create new vocabularies for their own purposes and combine them with ccrel as they please without seeking central approval just as we did with the legal text of the licenses we aim to create the minimal infrastructure required to enable collaboration and invention while letting it flourish as an organic distributed process we believe ccrel provides this primordial technical layer that can enable a vibrant application ecosystem and we look forward to the communitys innovative ideas that can now freely build upon ccrel
6870200 mozcc processes pages by listening for load events and then calling one or more metadata extractors on the content metadata extractors are javascript classes registered on browser startup they may be provided by mozcc or other extensions mozcc ships with extractors for all current and previous creative commons metadata recommendations in particular ccrel
6870201 operator detects microformats and rdfa in the web pages a user visits operator can be extended with action scripts that are triggered by specific data found in the web page the regions of the page that contain data are themselves highlighted so that users can visually detect and receive contextual information about the data it is relatively straight forward to write a creative commons action script that finds all creative commons licensed content inside a web page by looking for the rdfa syntax

6870203 neeru paharia past executive director of creative commons for the free floating content accountability architecture manu sporny ceo of bitmunk for the creative commons operator code and aaron swartz for the original creative commons rdf data model and metadata strategy more broadly the authors wish to acknowledge the work of a number of w3c groups in particular all members of the rdf in html task force mark birbeck jeremy carroll michael hausenblas shane mccarron steven pemberton and elias torres the semantic web deployment working group chaired by guus schreiber and david wood and the tireless w3c staff without whom there would be no rdfa grddl or rdf and thus no ccrel eric miller ralph swick ivan herman and dan connolly

6870207 a publisher who wishes to license a work under a creative commons license must at a minimum provide one rdf triple that specifies the value of the works license property i e the license that governs the work although this is the minimum amount of information creative commons also encourages publishers to include additional triples giving information about licensed works the title the name and url for assigning attribution and the document type new properties may be added over time defined by creative commons or by others observe that ccrel inherits the underlying extensibility of rdf all that is required to create new properties is to include additional triples that use these for example a community of photography publishers could agree to use an additional photoresolution property and this would not disrupt the operation of pre existing tools so long as the old properties remain available
6870208 with ccrel creative commons does not expect publishers to use these license properties directly or even to deal with them at all
6870209 the core of the current abstract model is to define rdf triples relating some web resource to a particular license e g by encoding this triple in rdfa in the xhtml source of the web document an alternative might have been to use rdf typing instead this approach would have made it possible to use the richer classification facilities of owl to define more complex licenses the owl restriction idiom is used by powder to attach document properties to classes of resources whether the attribution would then be added explicitly by the user or inferred by an owl aware tool is a secondary question the usage of owl might facilitate the modeling of a number of more complex features such as the definition of the disjointness of certain classes or the usage of property characterization functional inverse functional etc tools could then detect possible contradiction more easily it must be said that using owl even a simple profile thereof might be too complicated for the core constituency of ccrel supporting the model in this member submission we also recognize that such an approach would depart from the common usage of the xhtml license relation or dublin cores license term nevertheless it may be worth considering this direction in the future if more complex licensing approaches are to be considered and developed
6870210 some design choices of the semantic web lead to interesting interactions with the intended semantics of ccrel rdf is designed to allow systems to get useful and reliable data without supporting all possible forms of inference this is accomplished by making sure that any conclusions an application draws at one level of inference are still true when the application performs more inference the intended interpretation of ccrel licenses means that agents need to assume defaults on some properties for example the permission to use a work commercially is concluded from the absence of an explicit cc prohibits property likewise an agent will need to know the full set of cc requires statements before it can conclude that it actually can and will fulfill all requirements that go along with the agents intended use of the work in order to be able to draw these conclusions in a predictable way an agent needs to work on an explicit rdf graph the conclusions are then drawn limited to the scope of that graph speaking technically ccrel as currently specified employs non monotonic reasoning to map this non monotonic reasoning into rdfs monotonic semantic framework the reasoning needs to be scoped to a specific context to establish such a context ccrel could e g specify that no additional reasoning is applied to the graph that describes a license and limit the graph that is considered to the triples obtained by dereferencing the license uri given such an explicit rule someone wanting a list of documents which can be used as the basis for derivative works could perform a sparql query
6870211 the design pattern that we describe above enables transforming non monotonic data into monotonic data and is therefore safely usable by in the richer context of the semantic web however several key extension possibilities of the semantic web need to be restricted when using defaults inference properties from rdfs and owl may not be used to infer requires relationships as applications that dont perform exactly this inference will assume a contradictory default value aggregation while agents may trust more sources than are listed as authoritative any of these may introduce contradictory statements which the system can not detect as contradictory extensibility applications designed to process extensions of a particular set of data will presume potentially incorrect default values when examining unextended data while the trade off between these restrictions and the use of defaults may very well be the right choice for the ccrel case we recommend caution in other environments in which the semantic webs ability to extend and mix knowledge from different sources is beneficial to consumers of the data
6870212 we use private rights to create public goods creative works set free for certain uses like the free software and open source movements our ends are cooperative and community minded but our means are voluntary and libertarian we work to offer creators a best of both worlds way to protect their works while encouraging certain uses of them to declare some rights reserved thus a single goal unites creative commons current and future projects to build a layer of reasonable flexible copyright in the face of increasingly restrictive default rules

6870243 i dont think it is imperative but it is something that could be incremental to their business model long term
6870244 zis refusal to negotiate is perplexing and inappropriate given the compelling premium our proposal represents to zis market price and the liquidity opportunity it will create especially in light of the disappointing financial performance and cash outlook zi reported last week

6870262 if you look around the south for example youll see that most if not practically all of the blacks elected to state house and senate seats have been elected from majority black districts
6870263 its really very unusual for a black candidate who runs at the statewide level in any jurisdiction at large to get nominated or elected
6870264 one hundred years later the negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity
6870265 those are clearly heights to which you would not have seen african americans move at the time of the
6870266 they still cant get access to real capital secondly you need business to business sales to grow and the amount of discrimination in the business to business market is very high
6870267 the african american community has traditionally been involved in service type businesses that are not necessarily going to attract equity capital
6870268 whites have not only inherited wealth from their ancestors for a longer period of time they inherit an understanding of our financial system
6870269 the people who still call the shots are of one race
6870270 in fact my best caucasian friend often says ill handle this so we can all be equal now we should probably handle these things together
6870271 whites talk like well the playing field is even now but the playing field in terms of legacy is not

6870277 its tough to claim that there is no discrimination in the criminal justice system but a 6 to 1 ratio is far too great a variation to be attributable only to discrimination

6870287 there was a time when the un locked us down in our base
6870288 i was in a smaller base it was me and one other american guy and a couple sudanese people living in this village and we were locked down because of a rebel the lords resistance army group out of uganda we had to stay in our base for two weeks cause it wasnt safe to go out
6870289 its a life changing experience to go to a place that has absolutely nothing and see happy people here in america we have too much stuff and we strive to get more and more and we are still not happy

6870379 these numbers are more realistic than what the street had been anticipating i dont think the buy side was expecting the third and fourth quarter to be positive the are just slow to catch up
6870380 most of this is related to the macroeconomic environment which has forced consumers to rein in their spending
6870381 its a bear market the other sectors are going to feel it in their profits too
6870382 i think a lot of the negative earnings revision you have are due to input costs that are causing margins to compress

6870427 maybe its a guy thing if the guy has had so much of his identity wrapped up in his profession and hasnt developed other areas of his life to their fuller capacity
6870428 but i would guess that many women now could be experiencing the same kind of thing a transition like this requires a whole reorganization of self and daily life
6870429 the energy required to devote oneself to athletic performance or other pursuits is enormous
6870430 and then when it pays off with recognition that recognition becomes its own high the absence of the adrenaline rush of attention feels more like a depression than a normal state and that can create internal panic
6870431 if youve been at the same job a long time theres a burnout factor your initial reaction is to get away from this totally
6870432 but then you realize i dont want to do nothing you still have youth and all your skills but you dont want to get back in a situation where it has control of you
6870433 i thought i probably could still play but when i retired i was done there were so many things i wanted to do outside baseball

6870461 we believe obama will see a significant bump and believe it is reasonable to expect nearly a 15 point bounce out of a convention in this political environment
6870462 presidential races are close and we expect this one to be no different but they should figure out how to spin the fact that john mccain owns a dozen houses and thinks the fundamentals of our economy are strong before trying to spin our convention

6870483 mccains sacrifice had nothing to do with protecting the united states he was sent to vietnam along with hundreds of thousands of others in an attempt to prop up what was essentially an american colony south vietnam which was being run by a dictator whom we installed
6870484 that had we taken the war to the north and made full consistent use of air power in the north we ultimately would have prevailed
6870485 is it morally right to drop bombs and missiles in a heavily populated area where hundreds if not thousands of civilians will perish

6870497 we come now to his precise argument notice the way in which he puts it this time he does not ask a question he makes a statement in verse 13 there is the categorical statement that the promise was not made to abraham through the medium of the law but through the medium of the righteousness of faith once again the apostle is just stating what is a sheer fact of history the history is found in those chapters of the book of genesis which deal with the story of abraham and it is important that we should go back to them the apostles whole case rests upon the history he says in effect it is just a sheer fact of history the history that you jews are so fond of and in which you make your boast it is just a fact of history that when god made this promise to abraham he did not do it in any sense in terms of law it was sheer grace it was pure promise he did not lay down particular conditions as to what abraham had to do or had not to do it was entirely a matter of promise
6870498 what the law does is to show our weaknesses and sins that was the effect of the giving of the law god never gave the law in order that men might be saved by it the business of the law was to bring out the character of sin that it might show the exceeding sinfulness of sin people were not clear about sin god purposed to define it for them and he defined it in the law the law pin points sin and therefore it aggravates it and thereby it works wrath
6870499 the law in telling me not to do a thing arouses in me because i am sinful an urge to do that very thing when the law comes to me and says you must not do such and such a thing it turns my mind on to that thing and because my nature is sinful creates in me a desire to do it so the very law of god that prohibits sin ends in a sense by making us sin the reason is not that there is anything wrong with the law but that there is something terribly wrong with us so if the promise were in terms of the law it would work nothing for us but wrath and condemnation

6870543 book 3 chapter 2 the heretics follow neither scripture nor tradition 1 when however they are confuted from the scriptures they turn round and accuse these same scriptures as if they were not correct nor of authority and assert that they are ambiguous and that the truth cannot be extracted from them by those who are ignorant of tradition for they allege that the truth was not delivered by means of written documents but viv voce wherefore also paul declared but we speak wisdom among those that are perfect but not the wisdom of this world 1 corinthians 2 6 and this wisdom each one of them alleges to be the fiction of his own inventing forsooth so that according to their idea the truth properly resides at one time in valentinus at another in marcion at another in cerinthus then afterwards in basilides or has even been indifferently in any other opponent who could speak nothing pertaining to salvation for every one of these men being altogether of a perverse disposition depraving the system of truth is not ashamed to preach himself 2 but again when we refer them to that tradition which originates from the apostles and which is preserved by means of the succession of presbyters in the churches they object to tradition saying that they themselves are wiser not merely than the presbyters but even than the apostles because they have discovered the unadulterated truth for they maintain that the apostles intermingled the things of the law with the words of the saviour and that not the apostles alone but even the lord himself spoke as at one time from the demiurge at another from the intermediate place and yet again from the pleroma but that they themselves indubitably unsulliedly and purely have knowledge of the hidden mystery this is indeed to blaspheme their creator after a most impudent manner it comes to this therefore that these men do now consent neither to scripture nor to tradition 3 such are the adversaries with whom we have to deal my very dear friend endeavouring like slippery serpents to escape at all points where fore they must be opposed at all points if per chance by cutting off their retreat we may succeed in turning them back to the truth for though it is not an easy thing for a soul under the influence of error to repent yet on the other hand it is not altogether impossible to escape from error when the truth is brought alongside it book 3 chapter 3 a refutation of the heretics from the fact that in the various churches a perpetual succession of bishops was kept up 1 it is within the power of all therefore in every church who may wish to see the truth to contemplate clearly the tradition of the apostles manifested throughout the whole world and we are in a position to reckon up those who were by the apostles instituted bishops in the churches and to demonstrate the succession of these men to our own times those who neither taught nor knew of anything like what these heretics rave about for if the apostles had known hidden mysteries which they were in the habit of imparting to the perfect apart and privily from the rest they would have delivered them especially to those to whom they were also committing the churches themselves for they were desirous that these men should be very perfect and blameless in all things whom also they were leaving behind as their successors delivering up their own place of government to these men which men if they discharged their functions honestly would be a great boon to the church but if they should fall away the direst calamity 2 since however it would be very tedious in such a volume as this to reckon up the successions of all the churches we do put to confusion all those who in whatever manner whether by an evil self pleasing by vainglory or by blindness and perverse opinion assemble in unauthorized meetings we do this i say by indicating that tradition derived from the apostles of the very great the very ancient and universally known church founded and organized at rome by the two most glorious apostles peter and paul as also by pointing out the faith preached to men which comes down to our time by means of the successions of the bishops for it is a matter of necessity that every church should agree with this church on account of its preeminent authority that is the faithful everywhere inasmuch as the apostolical tradition has been preserved continuously by those faithful men who exist everywhere 3 the blessed apostles then having founded and built up the church committed into the hands of linus the office of the episcopate of this linus paul makes mention in the epistles to timothy to him succeeded anacletus and after him in the third place from the apostles clement was allotted the bishopric this man as he had seen the blessed apostles and had been conversant with them might be said to have the preaching of the apostles still echoing in his ears and their traditions before his eyes nor was he alone in this for there were many still remaining who had received instructions from the apostles in the time of this clement no small dissension having occurred among the brethren at corinth the church in rome despatched a most powerful letter to the corinthians exhorting them to peace renewing their faith and declaring the tradition which it had lately received from the apostles proclaiming the one god omnipotent the maker of heaven and earth the creator of man who brought on the deluge and called abraham who led the people from the land of egypt spoke with moses set forth the law sent the prophets and who has prepared fire for the devil and his angels from this document whosoever chooses to do so may learn that he the father of our lord jesus christ was preached by the churches and may also understand the apostolical tradition of the church since this epistle is of older date than these men who are now propagating falsehood and who conjure into existence another god beyond the creator and the maker of all existing things to this clement there succeeded evaristus alexander followed evaristus then sixth from the apostles sixtus was appointed after him telephorus who was gloriously martyred then hyginus after him pius then after him anicetus soter having succeeded anicetus eleutherius does now in the twelfth place from the apostles hold the inheritance of the episcopate in this order and by this succession the ecclesiastical tradition from the apostles and the preaching of the truth have come down to us and this is most abundant proof that there is one and the same vivifying faith which has been preserved in the church from the apostles until now and handed down in truth 4 but polycarp also was not only instructed by apostles and conversed with many who had seen christ but was also by apostles in asia appointed bishop of the church in smyrna whom i also saw in my early youth for he tarried on earth a very long time and when a very old man gloriously and most nobly suffering martyrdom departed this life having always taught the things which he had learned from the apostles and which the church has handed down and which alone are true to these things all the asiatic churches testify as do also those men who have succeeded polycarp down to the present time a man who was of much greater weight and a more steadfast witness of truth than valentinus and marcion and the rest of the heretics he it was who coming to rome in the time of anicetus caused many to turn away from the aforesaid heretics to the church of god proclaiming that he had received this one and sole truth from the apostles that namely which is handed down by the church there are also those who heard from him that john the disciple of the lord going to bathe at ephesus and perceiving cerinthus within rushed out of the bath house without bathing exclaiming let us fly lest even the bath house fall down because cerinthus the enemy of the truth is within and polycarp himself replied to marcion who met him on one occasion and said do you know me i do know you the first born of satan such was the horror which the apostles and their disciples had against holding even verbal communication with any corrupters of the truth as paul also says a man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject knowing that he that is such is subverted and sins being condemned of himself titus 3 10 there is also a very powerful epistle of polycarp written to the philippians from which those who choose to do so and are anxious about their salvation can learn the character of his faith and the preaching of the truth then again the church in ephesus founded by paul and having john remaining among them permanently until the times of trajan is a true witness of the tradition of the apostles

6870599 buffy i had a dream last night something from before like warm hands a presence i cant explain it i think im supposed to be here i think the monks did craft a spell to send me to you and mom they made our memories but i think they had help making me human more than what i was
6870600 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6870601 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6870602 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6870603 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6870604 i really like the brush and i have smaller lashes myself
6870605 hold the wand at the base of the lashes a few seconds longer than you think you should
6870606 count to 10 and then 10 backward and then apply the mascara slowly in a back and forth motion it really gives the lashes a lift
6870607 take your time with the application most women rush it and dont put on nearly as much mascara as they need to
6870608 seagulls are a menace to scottish towns and cities they thrive on litter and their aggressive behaviour towards other birds pets and even people is increasingly problematic
6870609 dumfries has a particular problem with gulls with regular reports of divebombing and litter strewn around the town after a seagull has raided a bin
6870610 i even read this week about a young paperboy who has had to abandon his deliveries due to constant attacks from the birds
6870611 from rspb scotlands point of view compromising the overall conservation of species is unacceptable
6870612 ideally we want to encourage them to go and nest in more acceptable places and it is possible these measures will achieve that
6870613 the new team will be made up of local representatives and gull experts and will meet soon to consider ways in which gulls can be deterred from nesting in the town
6870614 by preventing gulls from nesting and destroying nests when discovered we can actively discourage them from breeding in dumfries and hopefully force them to look elsewhere
6870615 if successful lessons learned will be shared with other local authorities so they can see what has worked in dumfries with a view to implementing an appropriate response to problems in their area i am sure this will prove to be a worthwhile exercise and an effective means of reducing numbers of nuisance birds in scotlands towns and cities
6870616 there is no doubt the dumfries population of gulls are getting bolder they are now stealing food from peoples hands and harassing locals and visitors its only a matter of time before a gull collides with someone and there is a serious injury
6870617 the time for discussion was at the gull summit in june now its time for action i am delighted the task force will be set up to remove nests and break up the gull colonies there will be an array of gull experts on this group and i will be looking to them to do everything they can to rid dumfries of this problem

6870626 if the municipal official is acquitted or found not guilty or is otherwise cleared of the charges which were the basis of the arrest indictment or information by reason of which he or she was suspended under the provisions of this section then the governor shall forthwith revoke the suspension and restore such municipal official to office and the official shall be entitled and be paid full back pay and such other emoluments or allowances to which he or she would have been entitled for the full period of time of the suspension
6870627 it appears therefore that based on the explicit wording of the above cited statute the appropriate procedure is for mr rosado to first request that the governor enter an executive order revoking the suspension if the governor revokes the suspension then the statute mandates payment of back pay and benefits

6870673 we installed vmware software to expose students to security and manageability issues in various operating system environments
6870674 we feel that hands on experience with best in class virtualization technology is important and necessary for our students it is essential for students to develop expertise in virtualization which is becoming the standard datacenter platform for companies around the world to optimize their it infrastructures
6870675 in a virtual environment our students can perform security related activities in networked scenarios on virtual machines without compromising physical hosts and networks
6870676 the flexibility of virtualization also allows us to create and eliminate virtual machines quickly and easily thats extremely helpful in an education environment where students are constantly working on new projects and assignments
6870677 vmware lab manager will help singapore polytechnic realize our objective of letting students access their virtual labs from anywhere on the campus via the web browser on their personal laptops
6870678 this novel use of virtual machines for it education is testament to vmwares flexible game changing technology
6870679 exposing students to the concept and possibilities of virtualization is exactly what the it industry needs to seed expertise that will drive future growth and expansion of virtualization as more organizations standardize on virtual infrastructure we need professionals who are able to take full advantage of its potential

6870716 john accomplished so much in his ten short years here at ball state university it was incredible
6870717 what he has accomplished since he has left im not surprised john was a great teacher of the sport a great motivator to his athletes and had a passion to succeed we were very fortunate to have someone of johns caliber work with our student athletes
6870718 john is one of the most amazing and innovative coaches i have had the pleasure of working with
6870719 ever since his first days at ball state john has dreamed of coaching at the olympics his dedication drive and persistence have taken divers to some of the highest levels of competition in the mac the ncaas and now the olympics it was truly a pleasure to have john as a coach with our mens and womens diving team and now its even more exciting to see his dreams of olympic coaching come true

6870729 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6870730 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6870731 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6870732 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6870733 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6870734 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6870735 in light of todays email from jobeth williams to sag members which contained martin sheens letter i thought the following email sent by jobeth to fellow amv affected member voting organizer james eckhouse would be of interest to you below that is an email from membership first candidate and amv petition signer clancy brown which he sent to me after filing his paperwork to become a candidate by focusing their campaign on this empty claim membership first shows how little they have to offer the membership everyone understands the biggest problem facing actors right now is that our unions are competing against themselves if membership first had a solution for that we wouldnt keep hearing about this non issue martin sheen blasted our slate because some of us supported amv and claimed wed continue to pursuit sic it despite our public pledge not to meanwhile the emails show that two candidates on the slate hes endorsing including the one who sent out his letter previously supported the idea is he now going to advise sag members not to vote for those candidates either
6870736 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6870737 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6870738 the trick here is its three different properties the comic the movie and the video game
6870739 for us it was creating another 400 ways to kill people just when you think it cant get any worse it turns another corner
6870740 the comic book has its own voice the game has its own voice we have our own voice too
6870741 if a human arsonist targets a specific church out of human vengeance then it is evil because god says
6870742 please do not ignore us men and women of the way
6870743 the trouble with baseball is that by the time you learn how to play it you cant play it anymore
6870744 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6870745 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6870746 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6870747 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6870748 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6870749 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6870750 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6870751 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6870752 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6870753 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6870754 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6870755 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6870756 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6870757 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6870758 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6870759 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6870760 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6870761 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6870762 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6870763 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6870764 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6870765 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6870766 the ignorance of villagers is one of the main hurdles they are carrying the dead chickens without any protective gear
6870767 most villagers are not aware of the disease they are eating the dead chickens their children are playing with the infected chickens in the courtyards its horrible
6870768 political conventions 101 and hear about what happens at these conventions what we can expect from the festivities over the next two weeks what issues will be discussed about delegates candidates and more
6870769 celebrities dont have to worry about family budgets but we sure do
6870770 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6870771 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6870772 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6870773 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6870774 barack obamas presidential campaign has put the brakes on ads that were running in seven states carried by the gop in the 2004 presidential election fox news has learned the seven states are alaska georgia montana north carolina north dakota florida and virginia
6870775 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6870776 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6870777 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

6870784 a new initiative will allow first time homebuyers access to the local housing market without the need to fund a deposit and including added protection against house price volatility the scheme which is being rolled out in conjunction with a number of leading residential property developers from across northern ireland will be available to first time buyers from early september a key feature of the new mortgage product includes a five per cent deposit on the property contributed by the developer repayable by the buyer only in the event of the property price rising by 5 or more after 5 years the buyer will also be safeguarded up to an additional 10 against any fall in property value over that 5 year period

6870805 the issue that i raised with the department of curriculum and instruction was not due to fear of an imminent threat since that is not my place to determine
6870806 my primary concern was his statement was not in the context of any controversial lesson regarding gun violence in modern schools nor was there any objective being discussed that day which had any remote connection to his statements
6870807 i wrote the e mail five minutes after i got home from that class

6870809 the general process for student complaint about a faculty member is that the student should first take the complaint to the instructor and try to resolve it there

6870830 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6870831 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6870832 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6870833 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6870834 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6870859 historically modern societies double their wealth about every twenty five years this kind of growth projected across the next half century would dwarf the extra pension and other costs to society of more elderly dependents moreover it is far from certain that extra years of life mean extra years of ill health and dependency serious disease tends to be concentrated towards the end of life so living longer may simply postpone the point of onset without increasing the costs

6870862 people within the party recognise that until the stability of the assembly is more firmly established on a longer term basis there will be reluctance among people who are westminster mps to give up their seats to work exclusively in the assembly there will be a phasing in of that approach
6870863 we have a choice as a people either you continue with the division or you seek to end it my party took the position that in the right circumstances it was possible to proceed but that we couldnt concede to terror criminal activities had to end guns had to be handed over and there had be support for the police the courts and the rule of law
6870864 while political parties in ni would have wide areas where they can agree if you put the conservative party and the labour party into the same room you would have battles every day on issues of socio economic policy
6870865 the differences we have we are talking about and attempting to reach agreement on there are battles but they are ending without blood being spilt and that perhaps is the difference between now and the past

6870868 suicide bombing is not just a religious phenomenon it is employed by many secular organisations including the kurdish pkk and the marxist tamil tigers
6870869 ariel merari a tel aviv university psychologist has profiled 50 suicide bombers and found that there were hardly any common factors none were deranged or schizophrenic few had problems like depression merari concluded that the only factor linking all forms of suicide terrorism was the way bombers were recruited and trained it is the psychology of the group not the individual that is key
6870870 there are serious flaws in the nss and the approach it embodies but it is a document which offers all things to all readers while being strangely unable to provide much in the way of vision leadership and motivation or strategy in other words the nss refers to the uks core values human rights the rule of law legitimate and accountable government justice freedom tolerance and opportunity for all but these values are mentioned in a strangely passive and defensive way almost as if the most that should be done with these immense ideas is to protect them from marauding terrorists and criminals and of course to stop them being ruined by flood water saddest of all these values appear to constitute little more than the normality to which we are told the governments security strategy will enable us to return as soon as possible after some harm occurs
6870871 so far 200 projects in 70 towns and cities have been funded by whitehall in the attempt to develop the capacity of communities particularly involving muslim women to challenge and resist violent extremists

6870874 it is extremely difficult for the nationalist tradition to separate out what i might call peacetime britishness from unionist triumphalism just as many unionists find it difficult to separate irish patriotism from at least implied support for the ira i know this sounds piously balanced but i believe it to be the case
6870875 councillor robin newton the dup group leader said that on friday morning the strategic policy and resources committee will discuss the provision of hospitality for members of the armed forces following a homecoming parade to st annes cathedral
6870876 i hope that all committee members will be able to support the civic reception and that t hose who feel they are unable to vote for will at least not vote against the worst thing for the city will be if this issue becomes a political football with the resulting bad feeling that will be generated
6870877 the milieu of terrorists is invariably morally squalid when it is not merely criminal
6870878 the data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and islamic fundamentalism or any religion for that matter in fact the leading instigator of suicide attacks is the tamil tigers in sri lanka a marxist leninist group whose members are from hindu families but who are adamantly opposed to religion they have have committed 75 of the 188 incidents
6870879 liberal democracies may be able to resist muslim terrorism but the greatest long running threat to secularism democracy and science could come from within from the emerging coalition of the religious right and the romantic left brought together by a loathing for open society that they share with each other and with osama bin laden

6870905 as we are aging we can expect to lose a little bit of muscle mass every decade
6870906 and when we lose muscle mass that means our metabolism goes down
6870907 most women will really gain weight in their hips and thighs
6870908 with strength training you are constantly maintaining or maybe even adding a little bit of muscle weight you are also putting a little bit of stress on your bones which helps aid and maintain bone density
6870909 as people age we usually recommend decreasing calories slowly to help balance weight
6870910 but we also change the composition of what they eat as far as the protein carbs and fats go based on their health goals

6870922 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6870923 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6870924 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6870925 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

6870939 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6870940 cannot imagine that many americans would not consider it a privilege

6870953 wished to have no further personal contact with her about this case
6870954 you had people here who didnt want to leave but after a few days of being stranded they were saying ok its time to go

6870956 kyle is a weasel a lying cheating putrid weasel no spirit lives there he may be possessed by the devil but no spirit
6870957 you know what is funny did you see the interview he was whining that he did not win what a sore loser i hope he crashes in tomorrows race
6870958 he has a crappy pissy attitude causes crashes never owning up to it he sounds like a spoiled brat wonder how many times he will get pissed when his toyota croaks or maybe he will set a new record in toyota crashes
6870959 i hope zero to none maybe the outside wall will rearrange his ugly face his parents must be so ashamed of how they raised those 2 what awful arrogant mean spirited people they turned out to be
6870960 i hope he gets turned around hits the wall slammed so hard his teeth rattle
6870961 but maybe shed like some shrubery planted between along the back straightaway yeah the little shrub planted into the wall
6870962 with a brilliant smile and the early facial creases of happy dissipation he was known for being cranky curious passive aggressive and most of all persnickety
6870963 the most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms history shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing
6870964 i ask sir what is the militia it is the whole people except for a few public officials
6870965 whereas civil rulers not having their duty to the people duly before them may attempt to tyrannize and as military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear their private arms
6870966 the best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed
6870967 that the said constitution shall never be construed to authorize congress to infringe the just liberty of the press or the rights of conscience or to prevent the people of the united states who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms
6870968 the constitution preserves the advantage of being armed which americans possess over the people of almost every other nation where the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms
6870969 to suppose arms in the hands of citizens to be used at individual discretion except in private self defense or by partial orders of towns countries or districts of a state is to demolish every constitution and lay the laws prostrate so that liberty can be enjoyed by no man it is a dissolution of the government the fundamental law of the militia is that it be created directed and commanded by the laws and ever for the support of the laws
6870970 before a standing army can rule the people must be disarmed as they are in almost every kingdom in europe the supreme power in america cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be on any pretense raised in the united states a military force at the command of congress can execute no laws but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional for they will possess the power and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive
6870971 who are the militia are they not ourselves is it feared then that we shall turn our arms each man against his own bosom congress have no power to disarm the militia their swords and every other terrible implement of the soldier are the birthright of an american t he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments but where i trust in god it will ever remain in the hands of the people
6870972 whereas to preserve liberty it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms and be taught alike especially when young how to use them nor does it follow from this that all promiscuously must go into actual service on every occasion the mind that aims at a select militia must be influenced by a truly anti republican principle and when we see many men disposed to practice upon it whenever they can prevail no wonder true republicans are for carefully guarding against it
6870973 what country can preserve its liberties if its rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance let them take arms
6870974 no free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms
6870975 the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed a well regulated militia composed of the body of the people trained to arms is the best and most natural defense of a free country
6870976 what sir is the use of a militia it is to prevent the establishment of a standing army the bane of liberty whenever governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people they always attempt to destroy the militia in order to raise an army upon their ruins
6870977 to disarm the people that was the best and most effectual way to enslave them
6870978 but if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens little if at all inferior to them in discipline and use of arms who stand ready to defend their rights
6870979 are we at last brought to such humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our defense where is the difference between having our arms in possession and under our direction and having them under the management of congress if our defense be the real object of them under the management of congress if our defense be the real object of having those arms in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety or equal safety to us as in our own hands
6870980 the great object is that every man be armed every one who is able may have a gun
6870981 o sir we should have fine times indeed if to punish tyrants it were only sufficient to assemble the people your arms wherewith you could defend yourselves are gone
6870982 the people are not to be disarmed of their weapons they are left in full possession of them
6870983 certainly one of the chief guarantees of freedom under any government no matter how popular and respected is the right of citizens to keep and bear arms the right of citizens to bear arms is just one guarantee against arbitrary government one more safeguard against the tyranny which now appears remote in america but which historically has proven to be always possible
6870984 the militia is the natural defense of a free country against sudden foreign invasions domestic insurrections and domestic usurpation of power by rulers the right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered as the palladium of the liberties of the republic since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers and will generally enable the people to resist and triumph over them
6870985 most attractive to americans the possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave it being the ultimate means by which freedom was to be preserved
6870986 the right to bear arms is general it may be supposed from the phraseology of this provision that the right to keep and bear arms was only guaranteed to the militia but this would be an interpretation not warranted by the intent the militia as has been explained elsewhere consists of those persons who under the laws are liable to the performance of military duty and are officered and enrolled for service when called upon i f the right were limited to those enrolled the purpose of the guarantee might be defeated altogether by the action or the neglect to act of the government it was meant to hold in check the meaning of the provision undoubtedly is that the people from whom the militia must be taken shall have the right to keep and bear arms and they need no permission or regulation of law for the purpose but this enables the government to have a well regulated militia for to bear arms implies something more than mere keeping it implies the learning to handle and use them in a way that makes those who keep them ready for their efficient use in other words it implies the right to meet for voluntary discipline in arms observing in so doing the laws of public order

6871187 however the olympic record is really special to me tim mack is a really good friend of mine
6871188 i cant believe it i was not expecting to see more os than xs on my scorecard
6871189 i didnt expect to be there on my third attempt and to do it three times its very draining
6871190 i was exhausted to keep plugging away and not fall off it was tough
6871191 cuba are a great team with some great players they hit our pitching mistakes they hit them over the fence

6871197 hemos pedido que faciliten al cien por cien los servicios mientras tengamos que estar aqu y para trasladar a las v ctimas es lo fundamental porque la espera aqu para identificar es muy triste cuanto m s acorten los plazos mejor as que deben poner todos los medios t cnicos para identificar y los materiales para que salgamos lo antes posible de aqu y en las mejores condiciones
6871198 en menos de una hora recibieron unas 18 000 llamadas y se colapsaron
6871199 ahora hay que reconocer que han mejorado su atenci n a nosotros porque al principio no hicieron nada nos trajeron de canarias porque moralmente ten an que hacerlo pero ni siquiera nos dieron la informaci n sobre si estaban vivos o no
6871200 los tel fonos de informaci n de spanair no sirvieron para nada
6871201 la vicepresidenta ha garantizado que habr una oficina en la delegaci n de gobierno de canarias para que la gente de la isla tenga acceso a la informaci n porque la mitad de las v ctimas son de all
6871202 la solidez y entereza de ahora no son reales as que no sabemos si tendremos fuerzas suficientes para volver aqu en unos d as ser a muy duro en la isla tambi n se habla de un funeral para todos los municipios afectados pero hay que sopesarlo porque la gente est muy afectada
6871203 hay que personarse de manera individual al margen de que la asociaci n tambi n pudiera personarse tambi n como acusaci n
6871204 estamos muy lejos y deber a articularse para que en canarias haya alg n tipo de representaci n y buena comunicaci n
6871205 es probable que se intente hacer pero deber articularse bien y tener unos objetivos claros o no servir m s que para que alguien diga cosas en nombre de las v ctimas sin hablar con ellas
6871206 muchos ayuntamientos de las palmas est n ofreciendo a todas las familias los medios m dicos psicol gicos o de asistencia jur dica gratuita para este tipo de cosas para que no se gasten dinero en algo a lo que tienen derecho por ley
6871207 las indemnizaciones est n estipuladas por ley seg n la edad

6871209 absurdo tener que pagar unos honorarios a un abogado y gastar dinero en este tema

6871211 the best phone ive ever had and im loving it
6871212 as i have said many times i think for next year the time to think about it will be the end of the season or in the last part of the championship
6871213 now i am not talking to anyone and it is not the time
6871214 i am fully concentrated on the championship and i think it would be a mistake to think about next year so early
6871215 what is more important is to give a winning car to fernando
6871216 his holiness told kouchner that there is a certain form of brutal repression that continues parallel to the olympic games
6871217 we have the responsibility to take care of this planet
6871218 we must extend love to all creatures trees and beautiful things
6871219 the only guiding principle of sarkozys policy towards china appears to be not to displease beijing
6871220 but we were quickly disillusioned our envoys came up against a wall there was no opening
6871221 you just have to build up your confidence before you feel comfortable
6871222 we deserve to be in the final the way we have played
6871223 we cant celebrate too much now weve got to get ready for one last push
6871224 i think theyll be a really tough opponent for iceland to beat
6871225 we could have played better but there is a lot of pressure in the semi finals i was extremely happy with our performance in the final five minutes
6871226 weve spent years getting ready for this but the game is not won yet
6871227 the pullout was carried out without any incidents and was completed according to plan at 19 50 moscow time
6871228 peacekeeping checkpoints in the security zone inside georgia have started carrying out the tasks set before them in this way the russian side has implemented the agreements set out by the presidents of russia and france
6871229 it is my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6871230 the fact of the pullout of occupying forces from the main towns under enormous pressure from the international community is a good start and a step in the right direction
6871231 but we should not be under any illusions as our road to freedom will be long
6871232 one month ago i was deciding about my life without playing for four months then the reality was totally different from now its the return of ronaldinho football
6871233 we came here for gold but we didnt deserve to beat argentina
6871234 now the bronze medal may not be important from a brazilians point of view but in the future we will be proud of it
6871235 we deserve respect as a group of players because we took some criticism after the defeat to argentina
6871236 everyone came to china for a medal and we got one its not what we were expecting at the beginning but its one of the most important awards

6871239 when you put the worlds best track and field athletes on the worlds no 1 track surface you know youre going to witness some amazing performances and thats exactly what weve seen this week mondotrack was designed to enable athletes to perform at their very best
6871240 although we are not surprised to have seen five new world records set at these games we are thrilled to have provided the track that helped these athletes achieve the pinnacle of success in their sports
6871241 it was bound to come to an end but thats a reason for not boasting about it
6871242 sejak smp aku memang suka nulis mama yang dulu suka ngajarin aku bikin puisi
6871243 aku enjoy banget kerja di sini selain bisa tetap nulis aku juga belajar presentasi dan ketemu klien biarpun banyak tawaran main film pekerjaan ini tetap nomor satu
6871244 kalau kerjaan di kantor lagi ribet aku enggak mau ngambil kerjaan lain
6871245 i was so honored to be asked to design this shirt i hope people will like it and by purchasing it do something positive for the environment
6871246 countries here are spending an extraordinary amount of money in their high performance programmes far more than we do
6871247 our programme is around trying to extract as much value out of the resources as we can these results give us a lot of confidence were on the right path clearly this is a work in progress this never stops what we need to do now is look forward to london 2012 if our funding stays as it is were going to go backwards put a little bit more money in it will probably allow us to tread water what we need to do if were really serious and we want sustainability and keep the good performances going is really look at where we need to put some more money in
6871248 its going to be important that we sit down and take a really long hard look and make sure that we dont gloss over and cover anything over its only through that rigorous critique the good and the bad that well determine a good course of action going forward
6871249 there were so many police in dunedin they were too scared to do anything
6871250 its not just the people that travel down it also attracts local dunedin students who join them and thats where its difficult to assess what numbers may ultimately be involved in partying
6871251 i sat in that great drawing room all on a sofa by myself i felt just like a duke
6871252 if they take us out our game were in trouble
6871253 a lot of these teams cant just come out here and beat us without messing with us or getting under our skin
6871254 were helping each other out were trusting in each other and thats what youve got to have during the season especially through 82 games
6871255 if we didnt get along then wed have problems everybodys had a lot of fun on this team on the court off the court and thats what makes it special
6871256 served our community for six years and accounted for the search and apprehension of numerous felons and the recovery of drugs and illegal contraband in the portsmouth and scioto county areas

6871259 the likelihood exists that we will have to assist residents who may be trapped in their homes without the ability to leave because of flooded roads
6871260 my house never flooded and ive been here since 1999
6871261 its just too much water theres no where for it to go
6871262 affected with flooding and some affected with no potable water due to flooded wells officials aid in a recently released statement
6871263 as a result the city is encouraging residents to keep water usage to a minimum including limiting the use of washing machines dishwashers and showers until after the storm passes a city news release said
6871264 beauty is in the eye of the beholder and unfortunately most utah residents have always seen thick green grass as drop dead gorgeous it is that but the allure is also hideously unnatural

6871270 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6871271 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6871272 of new police officer recruits last month 25 per cent were from bme backgrounds 38 per cent of police community support officers are from minorities dipping their toes in to see whether a career in policing is for them about 22 per cent of the police staff are from minority backgrounds thats just over 3 000 people we are getting better at retaining those officers and progressing them into higher ranks however a huge amount of work still needs to be done particularly in the ranks

6871282 i wasnt thinking lets steal this idea so we can market it ourselves
6871283 i simply knew that this was the right way to build software
6871284 bottom line is that when most developers see a really good idea they cant imagine building a product without that new idea
6871285 i have been involved in cases where system patents identified very good ideas but provided very limited specifications and claim language other than indicating a computer and software as the structure

6871289 its a balancing act to make sure you dont take too much time away from traditional reporting
6871290 the freshmen didnt pick up the blocking scheme so senior cornerback robbie mcatee came down shed the block and knocked the wind out of me
6871291 i was so mad and i was saying to myself if the freshmen dont know what theyre doing not only am i not going to catch the ball im going to get killed
6871292 it was the same blocking scheme but i didnt even have to look out there because i knew he was going to get the job done
6871293 the others still are on a learning curve and im losing patience with that learning curve
6871294 i think hes athletic enough and fast enough as well i really believe hell be a big time player for us before its all over
6871295 i dont think theres any doubt hed be the no 2 guy if he worked strictly at wide receiver
6871296 some guys have a little owie and cant get through a practice then theyll miss one then they come back and then theyll miss another one
6871297 weve still got our work cut out for us but we better start getting crisper in the next three or four days
6871298 i think therell be some mistakes early but when all is said and done well be strong at wide receiver
6871299 as long as the market is trading above the 200 day moving average this market is still in bull mode longer term and bargain hunting will stay in play it should find support there 108 with resistance in the near term at 122 sell near 122 and buy near 108 the middle is 115 the pivot the funds and the will have a major role in the direction

6871311 they were all fine last year it was the same it was really good on friday and we just had a bit of a laugh with them
6871312 it is a bit early to predict what will happen yet students traditionally leave the flats and go to the pubs but historically we havent really had any trouble with that
6871313 for want of a better word scumbags from around dunedin

6871325 we came outside and we saw flames coming out of the house we went to look and it started exploding even more
6871326 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6871327 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6871328 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science
6871329 we are hopeful that that will be the focus going forward
6871330 were not burying our head and trying to hide behind laws
6871331 were trying to say what is the best way to approach this issue
6871332 whether the style of behavior demonstrated by a university president or a professor at a dinner or reception will be replicated by freshmen let loose at their first friday night keg party
6871333 why permit 18 year olds to vote but not drink
6871334 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
6871335 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond
6871336 the only educational message colleges can deliver to students is dont its worth considering ways to teach young people how to drink responsibly for example by letting states create limited provisional rights

6871339 much of the increase is attributable to the significant number of people entering and re entering the labor force which could be a sign that workers believe jobs are out there and they are actively looking
6871340 weve definitely seen an increase in people coming in looking for work with little or no work experience in recent years because theyve been at home with their kids
6871341 were just seeing a number of road bumps in front of the economy right now
6871342 i still dont believe were going through any watershed change in the local or national economy but these individual shocks are adding up
6871343 republican presidents from lincoln through ford were strong advocates for equal rights balancing labor and business consumer protection protecting the environment a humble but vigorous foreign policy promoting peace through strength fiscal integrity a traditional republican would never condone torture or cruel and inhuman treatment of prisoners regardless of circumstances i see barack obama in the same vein although arguably even more inspirational
6871344 the fact that republicans in oregons 1st district nominated joel haugen over the establishment candidate is a sign that voters are increasingly rejecting the intense partisanship of the past 20 years
6871345 the leadership of both parties could learn a lot from joel
6871346 i really think its funny that senator obama wants to get into a debate on housing he is not exactly poor either

6871384 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite u
6871385 ending the war in iraq responsibly is in the broader strategic interests of the united states its long past time to drawdown our troop presence and to stop spending 10 billion a month in iraq so that we can increase resources for the mission in afghanistan rebuild our military and invest in our struggling economy at home
6871386 must include immunity for u s troops and defense department personnel from iraqi jurisdiction
6871387 she may not want you to touch her for awhile

6871398 perhaps it takes emblematic events to make us realize that the government is far from living up to its obligations
6871399 but this time there is growing social pressure and it appears to have a focus
6871400 the bottom line is coordination between the states and federal government and maybe this is going to be the catalyzer
6871401 theres enough political concern that theyre going to sit down and figure out a better way to coordinate

6871415 robinho has a contract with madrid but i think it would be harmful if he stayed at the club and wasnt happy about it because it would be bad for his career
6871416 he also has world cup qualification to play with his national team and i think this would be very bad for robinho
6871417 its robinhos opinion hes made known his interest in leaving madrid but its something the directors have to decide together with the player to find the best option for both
6871418 for me the best solution is for madrid to be okay
6871419 i think that there are top drawer substitutes for robinho who could occupy both the left and the right wing

6871430 we are truly grateful to them for their compassion and generosity
6871431 they make a huge impact on our community and thanks to them the homeless and indigent can now get the help they need and deserve
6871432 in addition to being a national model for supporting and transforming the lives of the homeless haven for hope should also be a national model in terms of the public and private sectors coming together for the greater good of a city
6871433 beyond the tremendous care that the facility will provide to the homeless and indigent population in our community it will also save tremendous taxpayer dollars
6871434 the number of voluntary departures left us short of the total needed to align payroll costs with our reduced revenues

6871436 as we deepen our dialogue about our global interactions there is no better place than the united nations to commend these companies who have made it part of their common culture to understand and value diverse perspectives
6871437 they already have incorporated the kind of outlook needed to compete in the new economy and on the world stage
6871438 we are pleased that ushaa acknowledged our progress in the diversity arena with their highest award

6871442 i am humbled to be in the company of companies with such long and distinguished track records in their respective industries

6871458 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6871459 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6871460 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science
6871461 we are hopeful that that will be the focus going forward
6871462 were not burying our head and trying to hide behind laws

6871465 why permit 18 year olds to vote but not drink
6871466 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
6871467 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond
6871468 the only educational message colleges can deliver to students is dont its worth considering ways to teach young people how to drink responsibly for example by letting states create limited provisional rights

6871471 russia has been in the news because of the events in georgia but recent headlines havent really affected our view of investing in the country
6871472 we have been significantly underweight for some years largely due to concerns regarding corporate governance financial disclosure treatment of minority shareholders and the growing role of the state in the private sector
6871473 we have had issues with things like companies with no independent directors skimpy reporting conflicts of interest and a general lack of transparency
6871474 its not very heartening for investors to see that kind of stuff happening its not what you want to see in a stable investment environment to say the least
6871475 i dont know where oil will end up but lukoil and gazprom are trading at 10 times earnings or so

6871542 yes maam just show me the ones you want to get
6871543 im so excited wait wtf was i thinking im boxed in with 10k other people who dont look like theyre going to make fools of themselves wish i could say the same ok then lets get it on
6871544 what after that display you think im going to let you keep up even if with the slowest part of the peleton har har har think again buster
6871545 im okay to coming within 2 minutes of my goal time
6871546 we need a cooling off phase we need a moratorium until we can get this broken system repaired
6871547 people ask what would jesus do i know for sure what jesus would not do jesus would not sweep into a community gather up a large number of people disrupt families and create anxiety in my own mind i know jesus would not do that
6871548 we will continue to enforce the law and i would stress we do that in a very professional way with an acute awareness of the impact that enforcement has on the individuals we encounter
6871549 we believe he and his colleagues would better serve the community to encourage individuals to comply with the law or work to change those laws rather than asking a law enforcement agent not to enforce the law
6871550 in the context of their faith and sanctity of their conscience
6871551 and if they find this to be in conflict with their conscience we are asking that they would be respected as conscientious objectors its possible if the agents understand the consequences of these raids they would say i dont want to be part of it
6871552 i just hope we dont lose sight of the more important divine law the moral law
6871553 as religious leaders we understand and support the need to apprehend and arrest individuals who are responsible for felonies and other serious crimes
6871554 the enforcement of just laws is necessary for public safety and the common good but the arrest of serious criminals is not what we have observed in the arrest and detention of immigrants that has recently taken place in our state
6871555 the confusing and secretive detention of those arrested has further complicated the situation
6871556 as religious leaders concerned for our people we would be negligent in our pastoral duties if we didnt speak out against these unjust government policies and practices
6871557 this proposed regulation is about the legal right of a health care professional to practice according to their conscience
6871558 doctors and other health care providers should not be forced to choose between good professional standing and violating their conscience freedom of expression and action should not be surrendered upon the issuance of a health care degree

6871563 negotiators agreed several weeks ago to reduce the presence of all u
6871564 they have both agreed to 2011 mohammed al haj hamoud iraqs chief negotiator said in a telephone interview
6871565 if the iraqi government at that time decides it is necessary to keep the american forces longer they can do so
6871566 iraq initially wanted all combat troops out by the end of 2009 but agreed to push the date to 2011 after the u s agreed to protect iraqi funds in u s banks from being seized by creditors
6871567 t he agreement as its working its way through the consultative process right now with the iraqis is not one that would require congressional specific congressional approval because this is the type of agreement in many cases that we have with many countries around the world so its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that

6871579 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off
6871580 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6871581 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6871582 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal

6871603 the swimmers finished earlier in the week and it was like there was an eruption
6871604 lo importante es abrir en la ciudad un debate frontal sobre este tema y no seguir dando pie a que este delito crezca
6871605 en el df durante el primer semestre de este a o se denunciaron 44 secuestros mientras que en el mismo periodo pero del a o pasado se denunciaron 25 lo que significa que este fen meno va en franco crecimiento
6871606 los programas implementados por las autoridades capitalinas para hacer frente a esta industria han fracasado pues s lo basta analizar las cifras de las que disponemos para comprobarlo
6871607 para nosotros las acciones radicales significan acabar con el negocio de los secuestradores que sepan de una vez por todas que nadie nunca m s les pagar un rescate
6871608 hay que afrontar el problema desde una perspectiva de fondo para crear otras condiciones y as impedir que siga siendo un negocio tan lucrativo como lo es ahora
6871609 de ninguna manera se coarta una libertad pues el familiar o la persona que intenta pagar un rescate no est actuando en libertad
6871610 cuando uno es v ctima de chantajes y presiones como es el caso de alguien que tiene secuestrado a una persona cercana lo nico que no tiene es libertad para decidir por lo que de manera enf tica aseguro que no se atenta contra la libertad de nadie
6871611 pues con esto s lo se logra aparecer en las portadas de los medios de comunicaci n pero no acabar con este delito

6871634 remember when jason matasow asked how can microsoft not be evil the question remains unanswered
6871635 as microsoft is set to pump up to 100 million more in novell for linux its important to note that microsoft is not paying off linux microsoft tool helps filter sql injection attacks
6871636 however novell has only invoiced 156 million of microsofts original 240 million certificate purchase leaving 35 of the funds

6871644 robbie hasnt really told me how many minutes im going to play but i think its just a matter of being prepared
6871645 we trained pretty well this week so you never know you could be on in the first minute or i could be on with two minutes to go so i think its just being mentally prepared and getting ready for a big battle
6871646 for us to turn back now means we dont trust ourselves
6871647 i think players will get to grips with this style and in the end this playing style will be something the whole world will fear
6871648 my game has just improved so much over the last couple of months with the big change in my ball striking
6871649 the only concern remains my putting as i again missed some opportunities unfortunately but its nice to be in the hunt again
6871650 its nice also knowing that i am not playing to my full potential and i still have a chance to win
6871651 its a traditional old style course and even though were only playing it at a par 70 it is still very challenging
6871652 though im not about to get ahead of myself and it will be still a case of taking everything nice and slowly and one step at a time

6871670 people have to look at this for what it is a disturbance between two individuals
6871671 obviously these kinds of things shouldnt happen but they happen on a regular basis and it shouldnt be made more than what it is
6871672 that said its important to remember nobody has been found guilty of anything yet so we should let it take its course through the courts
6871673 i dont think it would be fair to paint this as a racially motivated incident by any means allow the evidence to come out in court
6871674 russians have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
6871675 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6871676 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6871677 we gonna fight we gon fight fight for our rights
6871678 we are feeling the impacts of global economic factors beyond the control of any one individual or government
6871679 while over the course of the year we are projecting positive economic growth the outlook for real gdp growth in canada based on private sector forecasts has been revised down to 1 1 per cent in 2008 from 1 7 per cent in the budget projection
6871680 the global economy is slowing and canada is not an island
6871681 robinho has a contract with madrid but i think it would be harmful if he stayed at the club and wasnt happy about it because it would be bad for his career
6871682 he also has world cup qualification to play with his national team and i think this would be very bad for robinho
6871683 its robinhos opinion hes made known his interest in leaving madrid but its something the directors have to decide together with the player to find the best option for both
6871684 for me the best solution is for madrid to be okay
6871685 i think that there are top drawer substitutes for robinho who could occupy both the left and the right wing
6871686 first of all what im going to do is just focus on the falkirk game and we will try our best to do that because thats the number one priority
6871687 when that is out of the way i will look at the facts of said incident not rumours but facts and i can only deal with the facts when i get the facts
6871688 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6871689 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6871690 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6871691 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6871692 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6871693 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6871694 nefericirea este sa nu stii ceea ce vrei dar sa te omori pentru aobtine acel lucru
6871695 omul nu poate sa indure decat un anumit grad de nefericire ceea ce este mai mult fie il doboara fie il lasa apatic
6871696 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6871697 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6871698 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6871699 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6871700 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6871701 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6871702 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6871703 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6871704 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6871705 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6871706 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6871707 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6871708 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6871709 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6871710 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6871711 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6871712 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6871713 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6871714 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6871715 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6871716 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6871717 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6871718 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6871719 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6871720 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6871721 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6871722 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6871723 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6871724 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6871725 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6871726 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6871727 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6871728 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6871729 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6871730 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6871731 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6871732 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6871733 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6871734 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6871735 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6871736 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6871737 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6871738 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6871739 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6871740 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6871741 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6871742 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6871743 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6871744 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6871745 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6871746 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6871747 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6871748 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6871749 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6871750 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6871751 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6871752 this is a canadian government community up here at the top of canada and its no different from any other location in canada be it in newfoundland or be it in british columbia
6871753 i take comfort in the fact that the armed forces has demonstrated through this trip that they are able to transport someone whos severely injured
6871754 its a wonderfully eclectic objet dart speckled with an observable indifference for maureen dowd
6871755 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
6871756 we hadden de hoop dat we zaken weer recht zouden zetten en dat is niet gebeurd afschuwelijk
6871757 er is een stuk kraakbeen uit het oor van michael jackson gehaald dit is vervolgens gebruikt om het versleten neusbot te vervangen
6871758 ik denk wel dat hij geobsedeerd is door plastische chirurgie dit kan gevaarlijk zijn voor zijn gezondheid
6871759 the who wont play without me so we had to cancel the gig but we went on stage though and got our money
6871760 als ik aan het chatten ben voel ik mij behoorlijk eenzaam bovendien krijg ik pijn in mijn ogen van het turen naar het beeldscherm
6871761 het specifieke van doedelzakken is dat men in n toonaard a speelt en dat de grondtoon blijft
6871762 meio sofrido s vezes eu falava para a minha m e que tinha onde ficar mas n o tinha s que se for tudo do bom e do melhor sempre n o promessa
6871763 eles me pedem colocam os santinhos debaixo do chap u
6871764 i feel so blessed that they came out as good as they did
6871765 i loved the johnny cash records the edginess the rawness of them but i dont think thats glen
6871766 we went back to what glen loved and what people loved about glen i really wanted to make a record that sounded like those 60 songs
6871767 when i heard those songs for the first time they sounded hip to me and then later i noticed the lyrics were completely different i didnt realize galveston was about vietnam those songs lyrically were way ahead of the pack especially for the era when they were written
6871768 i said the only idea i have is glen campbell
6871769 i picked the ones that i wanted to sing and the rest of it was a piece of cake
6871770 how to curb global warming while protecting the incomes of american families
6871771 we did have some heavy rain recently and a lot of times that is what causes these things to happen
6871772 its not a whole lot but its certainly not what you want to have discharged in the water
6871773 maybe thomas h lee just wants to get rid of this thing and be done with it because they dont see a bright future for spectrum brands thats the 64 000 question
6871774 so they borrow the stock and sell it on the open market after it drops they buy back the stock at the lower price and theyve made a profit
6871775 prohibition from child care services of persons convicted of certain offenses

6871779 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6871780 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6871781 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6871782 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6871783 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6871784 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6871785 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6871786 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6871787 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6871788 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6871789 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6871790 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually

6871799 agora tenho de ver como vou pag lo mas estou feliz
6871800 pequenas quantidades de ur nio transitam por essa canaliza o que utilizada de forma ocasional
6871801 sempre questiono seguran a p blica com prazo de validade n o pra valer mobilizar essa for a s para o per odo eleitoral uma coisa ef mera transit ria provis ria n o vai ter maiores conseq ncias parece que s t m preocupa o com o fator elei o agora se realizarem um trabalho de intelig ncia com um bom planejamento de preven o ser inaceit vel ser uma afronta popula o que tudo se acabe em 5 de outubro que retirem o que est dando certo
6871802 uma pena que o ministro tarso genro n o tenha se conscientizado de que a quest o da viol ncia perpassa e vai al m do processo eleitoral o ideal seria que o estado tivesse sempre o apoio das for as federais
6871803 nossa posi o que a justi a eleitoral re na condi es para que o eleitor possa escolher seu candidato livremente mas n o sou favor vel continuidade das for as armadas a quest o da criminalidade deve ser enfrentada pelo governo do estado as tropas devem atender apenas a essa finalidade do processo eleitoral
6871804 o tse tribunal superior eleitoral n o tem capacidade al m do per odo eleitoral se o governador est interessado em manter o refor o da seguran a com for as militares que procure a forma jur dica adequada para isso de minha parte sou contra seguran a apenas para os candidatos a obriga o do governador garantir a seguran a de toda a popula o do estado
6871805 chegamos a essa situa o cr nica com a permissividade do estado e do prefeito que disse que a mil cia era um problema menor preciso mudar e n o sair com solu es de emerg ncia fico preocupada com essa resposta r pida marqueteira e sem consist ncia o constrangimento que os candidatos est o passando a popula o passa todos os dias sou contra tropas nas comunidades populares eles n o t m preparo para isso qualquer a o desastrada pode desmoralizar as for as armadas
6871806 acho que o governo est querendo justificar o desastre da pol tica de seguran a p blica com isso est admitindo sua impot ncia e tentando arrumar um biombo isso as tropas acentua a inseguran a e criminaliza essas comunidades o governo persiste no erro da pol tica de seguran a autorit ria e repressiva a pol tica do exterm nio dos pobres e tamb m dos policiais o que preciso restabelecer a seguran a continuada do estado
6871807 acho bom que o rio receba ajuda para manter a ordem a atitude do governador mostra que ele perdeu o controle da situa o n o se garante e a ajuda das tropas federais para as comunidades mas a situa o de falta de seguran a tamb m nos centros comerciais onde crimes como a saidinha de banco e o roubo do laptop aumentaram cerca de 51
6871808 they hit a lot of threes and love to drive and kick out for the open shot
6871809 according to press reports just one of mccains homes his 4
6871810 on average they have been asking for a 7 percent increase
6871811 as americans drive less because of the price of gas fewer claims will be filed with insurance companies
6871812 whether this will mean windfall profits for insurers or rate cuts for the consumers is up to governors and state regulators to determine
6871813 a lot of them say we dont regulate rates so we dont care
6871814 higher inflation and the commodities price boom increases the cost of steel plastic paint aluminum copper and everything else used to repair a vehicle
6871815 our position is we are going to go forward we are preparing for trial
6871816 the dollar got pounded yesterday and everybody rushed to buy commodities as a safe haven now the dollar is strengthening so everybodys dumping commodities again
6871817 obviously yesterdays rally was overcooked and were simply taking back some of that speculative risk premium we injected into the market
6871818 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6871819 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6871820 the light volumes are really sort of the reasons behind why youve got some outsize moves i think the issues over all for the economy and the market are fairly well understood
6871821 the market is of this mind set that were going to continue to be flattish to down
6871822 we need to absolutely find a bottom in financials to really believe that the bear can be behind us
6871823 i know she dont want to hear it kelly you know my condolences
6871824 she was murdered and you are responsible from the evidence its clear that sarah lunde did not have an easy life but it was her life and you chose to end that life and for that you deserve the maximum punishment
6871825 my next colonoscopy will probably involve a visit to the jet spray car wash instead of this process
6871826 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6871827 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6871828 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6871829 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6871830 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6871831 its important for the disability movement to be an advocate in your own life so you can identify what your rights and responsibilities are
6871832 we want people to be aware of this movement so they can be involved in their future
6871833 growing up with a disability youre probably not always sure about those laws and regulations
6871834 but if you are aware of them youre more likely to stand up for yourself and demand that equality thats needed
6871835 youth can have a big influence and they need to get involved
6871836 regardless of their age they can become a real leader
6871837 i think its a real strength they bring to communities

6871840 if youre in danger you have some place to go instead of just staying there
6871841 its kind of nice to have a place to go if you really needed it
6871842 in case they need help if theyre running away or in dangerous situations
6871843 just make the children comfortable see what situation is and call us
6871844 its just a community service i have my own kids
6871845 its wonderful all of these businesses are doing it hopefully more will join
6871846 most of the time theyre with us or near us but if ever theyre in trouble we want them to have a safe place to go

6871855 the man a subcontractor to a locally owned and operated postal company allegedly did not deliver the invoices and when he became aware that suspicions had been raised appears to have burned more than 900 invoices and envelopes

6871857 i could see the look on the drivers face it was like what can i do

6871912 when you are surrounded by a fleet of battleships all taking aim at you the possibility of a submarine is not really a problem
6871913 how can you be sure you dont infringe on someone elses patent
6871914 the fact is that these standards have known patent pools they are listed in the documents on the web sites even in the press releases
6871915 if youre limited to an executive summary flowchart of no more than 10 boxes that fit on one page youd be hard pressed to tell the differences between any of these codecs the differences are all in the details of course the details are very important
6871916 the claim that building on top of h 261 frees you from patent concerns and thats a reason to use h 261 over theora is dubious as theora is based on a codec of approximately the same age the truth is that as soon as you start trying to move forward using any of the discoveries published since then you immediately run into patent concerns again
6871917 part of the problem is that there is no legal test for unencumbered nor do you have to be infringing to get sued we will always have a halting problem here and yet both vorbis and theora are 10 years old with no claims against them would another 10 be sufficient twenty vague threats that come to nothing nothing that is except eliminating the monopoly interests competition are the story of my professional life patent law is being used to extort outright and most of the interests represented here are willingly buying into it this isnt even getting to the trolls and we sit around and wonder why this industry is so dysfunctional

6871923 has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
6871924 has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite u s presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality while sen mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement

6871926 at this point obama looks a little less reckless than he might have a few months ago

6871928 between now and election day not a lot of troops are going to come home
6871929 has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
6871930 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines

6871934 i loved the johnny cash records the edginess the rawness of them but i dont think thats glen
6871935 we went back to what glen loved and what people loved about glen i really wanted to make a record that sounded like those 60 songs
6871936 when i heard those songs for the first time they sounded hip to me and then later i noticed the lyrics were completely different i didnt realize galveston was about vietnam those songs lyrically were way ahead of the pack especially for the era when they were written
6871937 i said the only idea i have is glen campbell
6871938 i picked the ones that i wanted to sing and the rest of it was a piece of cake

6871940 some colleges may be taking environmental issues more seriously than society and some colleges are taking it more seriously than others theres a population of students that care about going to a school that is more environmentally friendly and thats only going to increase
6871941 the problem is coming up with metrics and a way to measure and compare how green a school is wed need time to produce something credible
6871942 wed have to educate ourselves on the different aspects of how to evaluate an institution by how green it is and there are a lot of different factors

6871975 while the administration has spent the last two years doing everything in its power to block a change in course that would made america more secure it appears the bush administration is finally inching toward adopting key elements of the strategy long advocated by senate democrats on iraq including a timeline for redeploying u s troops in order to incentivize the iraqis to take responsibility for their own country

6872011 i think that the true reputation of a party or a leader should be judged by the credibility they enjoy one must be true to ones own beliefs business organisations are also expected to preserve the trust and confidence that customers and stakeholders have in them in the ultimate analysis reputation cannot be earned or retained through advertising and other superficial brand building exercises it comes only by delivering consistently what you promise to the satisfaction of customers

6872071 fueron recibidos por la iglesia los ap stoles y ancianos
6872072 algunos de la secta de los fariseos que hab an cre do en cristo se levantaron diciendo es menester circuncidarlos a quien a los miembros de la iglesia de antioquia y a todos los gentiles que se convirtieran y mandarles que guarden la ley de mois s
6872073 habiendo grande contienda levant ndose pedro les dijo varones hermanos vosotros sab is c mo ya hace alg n tiempo que dios escogi que los gentiles oyesen por mi boca la palabra del evangelio y creyesen y dios les dio el esp ritu santo como a vosotros y ninguna diferencia hizo entre nosotros y ellos purificando por la fe sus corazones ahora pues por qu tent is a dios poniendo sobre la cerviz de los disc pulos yugo que ni nuestros padres ni nosotros hemos podido llevar antes por la gracia del se or jes s creemos que seremos salvos como tambi n ellos
6872074 por lo cual yo juzgo que los que de los gentiles se conviertan a dios no han de ser inquietados entonces pareci bien a los ap stoles a los ancianos con toda la iglesia elegir varones de ellos y enviarlos a antioquia con pablo y bernab y escribir por mano de ellos y decirles por cuanto hemos o do que algunos que han salido de nosotros os han inquietado con palabras trastornando vuestras almas mandando circuncidaros y guardar la ley a los cuales no mandamos

6872082 the idea was that this story could be both easy to understand and thought provoking
6872083 so you can just enjoy the breakdown of the optical illusion if you like or take a step back to think about changing your own perspective on life the overall message is that every dead end could potentially have an exit even for a guy trapped in a never ending staircase
6872084 i did quite a bit of the work myself i knew how to do things i wasnt this weak sister
6872085 robinho has a contract with madrid but i think it would be harmful if he stayed at the club and wasnt happy about it because it would be bad for his career
6872086 he also has world cup qualification to play with his national team and i think this would be very bad for robinho
6872087 its robinhos opinion hes made known his interest in leaving madrid but its something the directors have to decide together with the player to find the best option for both
6872088 for me the best solution is for madrid to be okay
6872089 i think that there are top drawer substitutes for robinho who could occupy both the left and the right wing
6872090 because of the suspicions weve got the action was taken to make sure nothing developed until the information we have is proven or disproven weve got no conclusive proof
6872091 any allegations with charges that lead us to investigate are taken very seriously
6872092 we will leave no stone unturned in determining whats taken place and well be very transparent
6872093 the stages are wider than last year but the fields are covered with sugarcane so following pace notes correctly will be important
6872094 i am happy with the car preparation and settings hot conditions here will affect the performance of drivers especially in the stages where the weather will be very humid
6872095 these numbers are more realistic than what the street had been anticipating i dont think the buy side was expecting the third and fourth quarter to be positive the sell side analysts are just slow to catch up
6872096 most of this is related to the macroeconomic environment which has forced consumers to rein in their spending
6872097 its a bear market the other sectors are going to feel it in their profits too
6872098 i think a lot of the negative earnings revision you have are due to input costs that are causing margins to compress
6872099 this is the slowest train wreck in our history everyone saw this coming but didnt really know the impact
6872100 in the current banking environment which continues to spiral down the banks we were talking about issuing a letter of credit to back the general obligation bonds that the city was going to issue are now saying we are not issuing any letters of credit not just to us but to anyone
6872101 i dont think anything will happen in 2008 we will be forced to rebid the project
6872102 we want to lock in the bids because they are within the budget right now and if we had to delay and wait until next spring the city and us may be exposed to a dramatically different cost structure
6872103 wed have a termination clause in case what we are in now turns out to be the great depression
6872104 the reason you can tell that is because i am prepared to personally guarantee repayment of the loan
6872105 i would think this is a positive thing to move forward
6872106 from the citys standpoint its a better deal than before council should see this as larrys commitment and move forward from there
6872107 this is mostly for the road and it is our infrastructure
6872108 i would like to see some connectors between main street and the marina that was just built because whatever happens on that property we are going to need a road
6872109 i am reluctant to support any more public money for that project until i see quite frankly a single privately financed brick
6872110 with the economy the way it is and tough choices we need to make in capital spending until i see private investment i will not support any more public investment
6872111 the city cleaned up the property to a commercial standard thats not good enough for us we need a residential standard
6872112 officers located the victim in the bathroom of the residence with what appeared to be a self inflicted gunshot to the head
6872113 paramedics checked the victim and were unable to render aid
6872114 hoquiam officers with a search warrant attempted to find this rumored second gun but did not locate it anywhere in the residence
6872115 the container found today with the firearm was not present at the time of the search on sunday
6872116 there is a pretty high legal threshold to commit someone against their will
6872117 it is difficult to stop someone from doing something they are intent on doing
6872118 with isolation came hopelessness they told me that my family is afraid of me if that is the case then there is no point in my living
6872119 and the department offers the deepest of condolences for their loss
6872120 i want to leave this world more balanced than i found it
6872121 i love what i do i havent looked at the offer yet ive been at the gang violence task force meeting all morning
6872122 i have no idea id be really torn i love my community and ive been able to do some great work in this place were luckier here at the oregonian than at a lot of other newspapers where they have just laid people off with a months notice
6872123 i think the buyout offer is testament to stickel in particular in that they have treated people like a family to how much they care about the people who have given their lives to this place
6872124 people at this point are really more concerned about whether it makes sense financially to go sooner than they had planned
6872125 there hasnt been a package like this ever i dont think
6872126 the coro transaction represents a strategic investment in a company with a proven management team working in two countries where we have political confidence chile and argentina and a commodity copper which we believe has strong fundamentals going forward
6872127 what convinces me about this is that people now are comfortable putting their photos onto the cloud
6872128 when you read about someones house catching on fire whats the first thing they try and save its the photos and the memories
6872129 and then go right up to small and medium business and then corporations
6872130 unknown political risk and constant negative headlines are not likely to induce investors to buy
6872131 we were concerned that the declining oil price and the mechel case would put pressure on the margins of companies and hence their earnings
6872132 foreigners are selling out bonds which is seen from bigger spreads and stocks which is clear from declining benchmarks
6872133 while many investors were plainly shocked by the escalation of the conflict with georgia we think that those bold enough to increase their russia exposure at this time of perceived elevated political risk may be rewarded
6872134 although volatility can be unwelcome in the short term it is precisely at times such as this that active managers can take advantage of market inefficiencies
6872135 we believe the long term investment case for russia is compelling
6872136 people have to get used to installing the bigger panels that will take time but we expect a pretty dramatic increase companies will go from one fourth to full size panels as their handling techniques catch up
6872137 thin film will close the gap in revenues with crystalline silicon that will happen in the next few quarters
6872138 the state government should come forward to promote the game
6872139 it has suddenly given a much needed boost to the game and gives us hope that the government would pay due attention
6872140 you could gauge the states apathy from the fact that a former hind kesari gets a monthly pension of rs 2 000 and that too after it was revised recently
6872141 who will fund them as almost all the wrestlers hail from poor family background
6872142 by more than a 3 to 1 ratio you sided with meyer in a dust up over the merits of breaking dawn
6872143 i knew he would try to destabilise me with his quick jabs
6872144 this has shown that even indians can win medals at the olympics forget about boxing or wrestling or shooting now we can even dream of winning a medal in every discipline under the sky
6872145 not just vijender its a victory for everyone here and those associated with the sport back home
6872146 we should not forget the contributions made by our support staff who are not here and by our boys sparring partners
6872147 sushil might be from the chhatrasal akhara but his guru is from here
6872148 rajiv is our most talented and decorated wrestler its a pity that he lost in beijing the boys are so demoralised today its showing in their practice
6872149 some doze off in the mud pit others under the gigantic banyan tree only some senior wrestlers get the luxury of a bed some even have to spread charpoys on the pavement bordering the akhara because they dont have a choice
6872150 for a livelihood its more or less the same at the chhatrasal stadium
6872151 sushils father comes all the way from his village in najafgarh 30km away with a can of milk and desi ghee i dont remember him skipping the routine even for a single day
6872152 lifes tough for the grapplers in akharas and even tougher for their parents who have to spend around rs 20 0000 per month on feeding them
6872153 for now we have around 89 wrestlers in the residential wing definitely there is shortage of space but then we do not turn away good wrestlers as they come here to learn the art which would help them earn a livelihood
6872154 come september we might have to vacate the stadium as it has to be renovated for the commonwealth games
6872155 producing world class grapplers is not easy where are the resources if people come visiting and see 4 5 of them sleeping in a single room they kick up a huge fuss about it
6872156 the wrestlers are used to this life make them sleep in a five star hotel and they will toss and turn all night itni mehnat karneke baad inko apna hosh nahin rehta after slugging it out all day long they dont even know where they sleep
6872157 but sure give them better conditions monetary help food supplements physios and foreign coaches and exposure trips we can only take them to a point beyond that we need huge resources
6872158 this has been sort of an ongoing thing with a lot of clients and ex clients ive been here for 5 years and its kind of a steady amount of calls of that nature
6872159 i guess he thought i was harassing him because i wouldnt stop following him
6872160 so he flagged down the police and told the police we were following him but he didnt want to press charges
6872161 es gibt musik kl nge t ne die so tief ber hren dass sie einen zum weinen bringen zugleich aber auch tr sten ruhig machen ein l cheln hervorbringen ans herz gehen heimatkl nge macht den betrachter und h rer schwindlig mit diesen stimmen seinen bildern von himmel und wolken felsen fl ssen und massiven gebirgen der schweizer alpen wo die menschen rufen singen jodeln juchzen sich erfreuen am echo am zwiegespr ch mit der natur das ist keine platte touristen folklore das ist echtes gef hl wahre kunst sehr sehenswert
6872162 der film handelt vom jodeln aber nicht vom gejuchz aus dem bluemeten tr gli sondern von einer wilden tradition und kreativen weltsprache drei musiker s nger jodler jodelphilosophen eigentlich beschw ren da ihre geister und gegenwarten sie suchen das eigene und finden es im appenzell oder in der mongolei und das ist erlauben wir uns das bisschen pathos ein wunder an rhythmus bildermelodie und unpr tenti ser gescheitheit der film st sst die t r zu weltgeschichten auf
6872163 als kind spielte ich klavier und es war mein traum musiker zu werden
6872164 es hat mich jedoch nie interessiert musikfilme zu machen oder musik zu verfilmen
6872165 es geht mir vielmehr darum die musik als vehikel zu benutzen um damit etwas anderes zu erz hlen das dahintersteht
6872166 das wollte ich zeigen es gibt einen ausdruck der auf ganz archaische formen von kultur und alltag zur ckgeht wo man sich spontan hinstellte wenn das wetter sich nderte oder sonst eine emotion einen bewegte und man das hinausgejuchzt hinausgejodelt hat
6872167 heimat ist ein sch nes wort das es so nur in der deutschen sprache gibt
6872168 man sollte den begriff nicht den ewiggestrigen berlassen es geht ja um ein ureigenes gef hl davon wo ich meine identit t habe das hat nichts mit ausgrenzen zu tun ich kann als schweizer in berlin heimat in mir haben und von dem standpunkt aus auch wunderbar mit anderen kulturen kommunizieren
6872169 es geht um die menschliche stimme in schwieterts heimatkl ngen um die stimme in dieser schweizer landschaft dann um drei menschen die ihre authentizit t entwickelt haben in einer auseinandersetzung mit der musik die aus dieser landschaft kommt um eine neue volksmusik sie haben diese freiheit gesucht von der noldi alder spricht doch wie verschieden sind sie erika stucky hat eine v llig andere geschichte sie wuchs bis zu ihrem zehnten lebensjahr in kalifornien auf und kam dann ins oberwalliser dorf m rel sie hat gleichsam zwei wurzeln die sie in ihren performances miteinander in einklang zu bringen versucht das tut sie auf stimmige weise ihr bezug zum lebensraum ist nicht ungebrochen da geht es eher darum den rahm abzusch pfen von der archaischen walliser sagenwelt und daraus etwas allerdings ganz eigenes zu machen ihre musik hat auch sehr viel mit theater zu tun mit der ironie dem paradoxen selbst wenn sie in einer kneipe in m rel f r die d rfler singt ein absurder auftritt

6872187 is producing a convergence of sorts around the idea that more is better that an expansion of energy production from all sources and places will somehow fix things lower prices and restore stability to the economy
6872188 i think its a combination of further concerns in the banking sector the dollar giving back its recent gains and geopolitical tension between the u s and russia all of which have drawn money flows back into oversold crude oil and energy stocks
6872189 conjured up visions of russian armored columns clanking through the streets of warsaw
6872190 such a scenario will not only further diminish the dollar but also the euro as safe havens

6872290 there remain serious shortages of judges court space crown attorneys court staff and the system support that these people need

6872295 when i heard those songs for the first time they sounded hip to me and then later i noticed the lyrics were completely different i didnt realize galveston was about vietnam those songs lyrically were way ahead of the pack especially for the era when they were written

6872303 it proves what were seeing and hearing all over the state people are rejecting the failed policies of the past
6872304 particularly on energy they are tired of watching tom udall and the far left anti drilling anti nuclear extremists deny access to american resources

6872320 the issue has been on newsstands longer than a typical one people released the issue on aug 4 two days before its regular newsstand drop date and the issue will stay on stands for three weeks through aug 25 and people also raised its cover price for the special issue to 4 49 or 50 cents more than its regular price
6872321 this is indeed one coup too many there is no justification for it and the wrong signal it sends is condemnable mauritania has had a history of military putsches the news of which was received in bad taste by the rest of the world
6872322 the august 6 coup provoked virtually unanimous condemnation from the united nations the european union and other quarters the african union suspended the islamic republic and the united states and france quickly suspended non humanitarian aid
6872323 my entire career depends on me getting off this list
6872324 i probably wont be able to get a job anywhere else in the world having this mark that im on this list
6872325 it is quite clear when the government does something that takes away not just your job but your occupation your career they have to provide you with some means to clear your name
6872326 i have no idea why i am on the list and theyre not telling officially that im even on the list
6872327 unfortunately it is a problem that is shared by countless individuals who have no connection to terrorism have no connection to crime and dont belong on this list
6872328 the problem with what the government is doing is that they really dont care about innocent casualties
6872329 we served in a war and theyre thumbing their noses at us basically and that makes me feel really sad about this situation
6872330 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6872331 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6872332 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6872333 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6872334 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6872335 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6872336 a skilled see the ice type forward he quarterbacks the power play and might be the best two step quickness guy in all of junior hockey in two steps he is at top speed and he can hit the brakes and delay the play with the best of them as well zach is an all around offensive player who sees the ice well and just a treat to watch the question is whether or not his average size is enough to get him through the rough periods and the checking there are other players in the nhl who have beaten that rap patrick kane and sam gagner are two great examples this year there is no reason why he shouldnt be a top offensive guy in the nhl
6872337 these are some of the things we bounce off ronnie francis
6872338 when you have a player that size there are certain things that a player needs to be able to do
6872339 he has to have really good hockey sense he has to be really quick he passes the test on that were fine with his size
6872340 there are lots of small guys small players obviously having great careers in the nhl
6872341 one guy i like to consider myself playing like is daniel briere of the philadelphia flyers hes a great player with similar size and skill set hopefully i can play like him someday
6872342 it was getting pretty exciting as carolinas pick was coming up
6872343 hes a more complete player than a lot of the bigger guys available at this point in time
6872344 sheldon is more emotional probably more aggressive excitable tony is more laid back its why they worked so well together
6872345 weve pretty much stayed with the same format and structure that weve used in the past
6872346 the way weve looked at the season and the scouting assignments has been virtually the same its a system that has worked well for us
6872347 it was something that always intrigued me and interested me because it was something i had done at the junior level
6872348 its always a little more exciting to have the additional responsibility of directing the scouting department and making that decision
6872349 its safe to say i had sort of accepted the fact i was working closely with sheldon and that was quite satisfactory and i was quite happy with that
6872350 i always thought that you never had to worry about tony taking shortcuts
6872351 you dont want a yes guy you want a guy that tells you what he sees
6872352 like all jobs there are a lot of positives but there is a lot of tedious long hours and research and grinding it out on the road and time by yourself and away from your family
6872353 people know were looking for a defenseman you dont know if or when thats going to happen
6872354 i think its a very fair deal for both sides
6872355 in our case this is a relatively young defenseman that we have tied up for four years we really want tim to build on the second half of this season as long as he does that hell be a very important part of our team
6872356 hes played that role in the past hes a great team player and he really fits into the character of our team
6872357 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6872358 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6872359 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have and that we can work through areas of disagreement toward common goals
6872360 they said traffic was being stopped and then they came up with we cant have a roadside stand and then they said it was a commercial enterprise
6872361 on the weekends is when i mostly notice them selling i come and go a lot and ive never seen any traffic problems
6872362 they may start out with a little card table and selling a couple of things but then who is to say what else they have is all the produce made there do they make it themselves are they going to have eggs and chickens for sale next
6872363 lemonade stands are technically illegal but they dont last long enough to do anything about
6872364 ob wir von einer rezession sprechen m ssen ist nur eine frage der definition
6872365 wir sind der europ ischen zentralbank unendlich dankbar dass sie mit ihrer unangebrachten hochzinspolitik den euro so stark gemacht hat
6872366 ich erwarte keine ra der h heren inflation die teuerungsprobleme sind nur vor bergehender natur
6872367 wenn erst einmal die arbeitslosenrate in den vereinigten staaten ber sechs prozent geklettert ist sind keine lohnerh hungen mehr durchsetzbar und der preisdruck l sst wieder nach
6872368 ich kann kein inflationsproblem erkennen lpreis und gold sind zuletzt kr ftig gefallen
6872369 als deutscher sehe ich das thema nicht so entspannt eine inflationsrate von heute etwas ber drei prozent das hat die vergangenheit gezeigt kann sich sehr schnell verdoppeln
6872370 wenn uns die finanzkrise eines lehrt dann dass investoren nicht nur das eigene risiko in ihre anlageentscheidung mit einbeziehen m ssen sondern auch die risiken anderer akteure
6872371 konservative anlagen sind das gebot der stunde ich w rde mir derzeit aber keine immobilie kaufen
6872372 es ist zeit aktien zu kaufen nach dem kurssturz sind viele titel g nstig zu bekommen zum niedrigsten preis einzusteigen schafft niemand
6872373 wenn beides eine unterbewertung signalisiert kaufe ich den titel unabh ngig von branche oder nachrichtenlage
6872374 da es sich um einen konflikt zwischen gro m chten handelt sollten wir uns sorgen machen und als w hler eine politik unterst tzen die f r kooperation und entspannung steht
6872375 wenn jemand fragt wie werde ich nobelpreistr ger ist er schon auf dem falschen pfad
6872376 das beste ist es wenn man berhaupt nicht dran denkt man muss von der wissenschaft ergriffen sein
6872377 the golf tournament on september 18th has been sold out for days and tickets to the gala dinner on september 20th are going fast
6872378 the excitement surrounding the weekend is a testament to the quality of the people being inducted into the hall this year theres a lot of talk that this may be the most exciting class weve ever inducted and given our games proud history thats quite a statement
6872379 this is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate whats great about canadian football the excitement it generates on the field and the positive difference it makes in our communities
6872380 this is an outstanding class and i know mark denobile and his team at the hall of fame are working incredibly hard to ensure the weekend is worthy of the honourees and a great time is had by all
6872381 el asesinato fue cometido en el marco de un ataque sistem tico a la poblaci n civil llevado a cabo por las organizaciones terroristas
6872382 el poder legislativo nacional resultar a responsable por cuanto el 26 de junio de 1973 amnisti a los guerrilleros sin desarmarlos suprimi la c mara federal en lo penal y la legislaci n antiterrorista dejando en libertad a algunos de los que secuestraron al militar
6872383 la estrategia de los ex guerrilleros estaba centrada en considerar prescriptos sus asesinatos secuestros y torturas por tratarse de delitos comunes realizados sin participaci n estatal
6872384 las cr nicas parlamentarias prueban que la clase pol tica contribuy a la tragedia sobreviniente calificando a quienes hab an sido condenados por hechos terroristas como perseguidos pol ticos que lucharon por la liberaci n y contra la dependencia
6872385 el desarrollo de las organizaciones guerrilleras en la argentina escapa a tipificaciones simplistas el erp prt no era una fuerza progresista sino una organizaci n revolucionaria que pretend a instaurar una sociedad marxista inspirada por el faro de la revoluci n cubana desde sus or genes consider que la v a pac fica al socialismo era una imposibilidad por lo que el cambio social s lo podr a llegar a trav s de una guerra revolucionaria
6872386 la violaci n de los derechos humanos de larrabure tuvo lugar en ocasi n de un conflicto armado conforme los lineamientos de la jurisprudencia internacional que en la causa milosevic ha explicado que el concepto de conflicto armado requiere nicamente que existan grupos armados organizados que sean capaces de librar combate y que de hecho lo hagan

6872390 i severed my ties to shroud this body under the streets of this city
6872391 at its summit we will sacrifice your heart even though
6872392 i need to play well this week and next week and so far this week ive done that
6872393 if nick then feels i am worthy of a pick so be it if not then thats acceptable
6872394 i have neither of my two partners from the last ryder cup
6872395 i mean olaz bal will be there but as a vice captain obviously luke with his wrist injury we are going to miss him for a while you know ive played with lee before and weve done well so that might be but i dont know what nick is thinking
6872396 you know im always happy to play with any of the newcomers and give them a little bit of how do you say like cheer them up and give them some confidence i think as an up and comer or as a rookie on the team its always nice when you play with one that has played some ryder cups well see but im sure that nick will do a great job and will mix everybody up nicely
6872397 obviously monty has done so much for the european team in the ryder cups and well see what happens
6872398 if he doesnt get to play obviously its something that we will miss

6872400 lord high keeper of the knowledge of right and wrong counselor in moments of temptation and guide along the straight and narrow path
6872401 also we should mention the poor choice of platform for the piston conversion on a round receiver bore as found on the m16 m4 system
6872402 zac had a very good year he has a really quick release on his shot he is a very busy player and he plays with a lot of energy out there he is a player that is constantly in motion he is offensive minded but plays well defensively too and has made huge improvements from last year he developed out of nowhere and had a really good year in the bchl
6872403 where we were we didnt think we had a shot at dalpe at all
6872404 there were lots of things talked about but i dont want to suggest were close to something
6872405 i talked to several teams but there are other teams talking about getting defensemen its a hard market right now
6872406 right now i dont think im done growing ive been growing like a bad habit the last couple years
6872407 this kid is a solid two way hockey player at both ends of the ice
6872408 hes a complete player away from the puck hes a goal scorer with a great shot
6872409 he had a strong second half of the season in plymouth
6872410 hes a pretty good two way defenseman with good puck skills we like the direction his game is going as he gets bigger and stronger
6872411 hes not a big guy 5 10 1 2 and 165 pounds but hes a very competitive goalie
6872412 the best way i can describe his style is hes a dominik hasek style goalie very unorthodox but he stops the puck
6872413 each of the shortlisted books are prizeworthy but two books shone for their readability rosalind belbens novel was innovatively plotted and convincingly executed while rosemary hills first book is a biography that does justice to the many facets of the man augustus pugin and his work

6872418 she is proud to be a crazy bitch because she can lead the life she want to
6872419 i dont care if you like me or not im going to bitch around because i am a bitch
6872420 there is rash speaking which is like the piercings of a sword but the tongue of the wise brings health
6872421 a soft answer turns away wrath but a grievous word stirs up anger the tongue of the wise utters knowledge aright but the mouth of fools pours out folly a gentle tongue is a tree of life but perverseness therein is a breaking of the spirit
6872422 the wise in heart shall be called prudent and the sweetness of the lips increases learning pleasant words are as a honeycomb sweet to the soul and health to the bones
6872423 he who guards his mouth keeps his life but he who opens wide his lips shall have destruction
6872424 the heart of the righteous studies how to answer but the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things
6872425 whosoever keeps his mouth and his tongue keeps his soul from troubles
6872426 see a man who is hasty in his words there is more hope for a fool than for him
6872427 if any man thinks himself to be religious and does not bridle his tongue he deceives himself and this mans religion is vain
6872428 he who would love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile
6872429 let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth but such as is good for edifying as the need may be that it may give grace to them that hear
6872430 a grievous word stirs up anger the mouth of fools pours forth folly
6872431 but if you bite and devour one another take heed that you not be consumed of one another
6872432 therefore you are without excuse o man whosoever you are who judges for in that very thing you judge another you condemn yourself for you who who judges practices the same things
6872433 your word is a lamp upon my feet and a light upon my path
6872434 there are two tragedies in life one is not to get what your heart desires and the other is to follow it
6872435 trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding
6872436 god is not obligated to give us answers but he promises us his grace

6872450 este tipo de lesi n puede ser causada porque en una velocidad realizada hubo un freno brusco o durante un partido de f tbol por la calidad del terreno de juego por lo que no est n acostumbrados a un terreno tan duro

6872523 im in favor of abortion rights because women dont take the decision to abort lightly
6872524 what i can do is say are there ways that we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies so that we actually are reducing the sense that women are seeking out abortions and as an example of that one of the things that ive talked about is how do we provide the resources that allow women to make the choice to keep a child you know have we given them the health care that they need have we given them the support services that they need have we given them the options of adoption that are necessary that i think can make a genuine difference
6872525 i am happy to publicly acknowledge this letter and my description of the concerns we in the common cause partnership have about the proposals of the windsor continuation group nonetheless it is disturbing to discover that at least one member of the windsor continuation group a body that is supposed to be working for reconciliation in the anglican communion so quickly leaked private correspondence in an attempt to gain some passing political advantage

6872570 were very excited about this our third class of global scholars
6872571 this is a rigorous academic program designed for high achieving students offering several unique classes with hands on opportunities and the requirement of spending a semester abroad
6872572 now im learning about the issues in depth how it all comes together
6872573 our first cohort of freshmen which began seam in jan 2008 had 18 students
6872574 now were up to 40 with 20 students declared as business majors and 20 as engineering majors
6872575 the program is designed to examine the business aspects as well as the engineering aspects of technology and leadership and it requires a full year of student teams working in partnership to develop a product taking it from concept to market
6872576 the students who are applying for and being admitted to these programs are helping to increase the strong academic profile of our college and the entire university
6872577 also the polish the professionalism and etiquette that these students are developing comes shining through
6872578 university drive is a major campus thoroughfare for pedestrians and bicyclists traveling to and from residence halls adjacent neighborhoods and parking lots on the periphery of campus
6872579 the bike lanes on university drive will serve as a major north south campus connector as well as an important and critical linkage with existing city bike routes
6872580 the way university drive is designed leads people to speed and makes crossing the road difficult for pedestrians
6872581 while the traffic load varies greatly from summer to the time when school is in session the experience allowed us to evaluate the affect of a lane reduction on traffic flow and the road continued to operate efficiently
6872582 the traffic studies make sense when you consider that lexington has other two lane roads that serve significantly higher volumes of traffic than university drive and still move cars efficiently such as euclid avenue waller avenue and alumni drive
6872583 it aint just the speed its the heart you want something thats not afraid to compete half these horses are just show ponies you want something thats not gonna run from a fight

6872586 up to now the slightest criticism of radical islam on campus has been slammed as islamophobia while muslim groups and their radical fellow travelers have been allowed to say the most hateful things imaginable about christians and jews without any reaction from university administrators whatsoever
6872587 provost nikias has called the hadith on the msa website for what it is despicable given the atmosphere that prevails on most campuses today it was an act of integrity on his part to make this call and to demand that the msa live up to basic standards of civility that should govern the university
6872588 abu huraira reported allahs messenger may peace be upon him as saying the last hour would not come unless the muslims will fight against the jews and the muslims would kill them until the jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a stone or a tree would say muslim or the servant of allah there is a jew behind me come and kill him

6872600 inside the city residents were once again able to live their lives in peace
6872601 while the chinese leadership appears to want to pursue a pragmatic policy towards japan the mobilization of the historical legacy in the context of popular chinese nationalism constantly limits the ability of the chinese leadership to develop and maintain a rational relationship
6872602 what disappointed me most about the memorial was that i had expected the exhibition to be condensed and focused but as it turned out things were just the opposite
6872603 after the visit i often wondered why i was not the least touched or moved by the exhibition one reason is that i was already familiar with that history so that nothing on display made me feel aghast or strike me as particularly overwhelming i have watched the movie
6872604 as for the relationship between the chinese and the japanese i would like to share some of my thoughts to begin with neither side should take the massacre too personally when people take things personally their emotions gain over their reason giving rise to unjustified hatred which often leads to calamity in about thirty years all people who once lived to have any kind of personal experience about the massacre will be dead the future relationship between the chinese and the japanese in regard to the massacre will solely depends on how people who have no personal experience of this matter view and interpret it i suggest that both the chinese and the japanese accept the massacre as an established historical fact try to analyze it in an objective manner and draw up schemes to prevent similar calamities from happening i believe that the national characteristics of the chinese and those of the japanese played crucial roles in the massacre in the light of this a thorough and in depth analysis seems particularly important china including its government and its people stop assuming the role of a once scarred victim and stop emphasizing its old tragedy too frequently if one indulges in the past no matter good or bad it is one loses hold of the present the past is to be learned and remembered not to be a burden that hinders the march into the future as for the japanese their national characteristics contain some particularly dangerous elements that are likely to result in calamities like the massacre hopefully they can face those elements with a positive attitude
6872605 yes we like japanese technology gadgets and machines but not the people at that time they always referred to us chinese as pigs but here we see who was really an animal and inhumane
6872606 japan is keenly aware of its responsibility for the massive suffering and loss inflicted on the people of china resulting from its invasion of china at one time in the past and expresses its deep regret

6872615 the children who have that cute look of a jack o lantern where they are losing teeth and their adult teeth havent come in yet they are missing their maxillary bicuspids the upper teeth in front of the molars
6872616 the bones have growing points that have growth plates and they mature at a steady rate
6872617 obviously when you go through puberty they go through acceleration so in the fingers and wrist they fuse at different times any bone that grows there are standards for how mature they should be

6872624 im always looking for new ways to get people interested in jazz
6872625 my thought was that maybe if we combined a little bit of theater with jazz music and create an original program it would be something really different
6872626 ron said he wanted to try something that merged the music with theater a singer narration and script
6872627 i looked at the songs and put them in a chronological order and somehow the songs that misty chose touched on the major aspects of holidays life
6872628 theres a lot of biographical information and i try to put it into context of the era and tell the stories behind the specific songs that misty sings
6872629 billie holiday of course was very prolific in the songs she recorded
6872630 but the knowledge of billie holiday has faded some over time she was a very famous woman she had a tragic life we just wanted to give people some of her background
6872631 when you do something like this youre not going to duplicate billie holiday
6872632 the whole purpose is to try and get more people interested in jazz
6872633 were talking about doing others for louis armstrong peggy lee and others to try and educate people about the jazz masters

6872638 might be freaky like he might think im a stalker or something and i would be if i didnt have my own show
6872639 visually death race is as hackneyed a film as can be performance wise its in rem sleep
6872640 anderson seems to take every chance he can to aim the camera through other elements smoke glass water flame iron bars dust and so on to capture the focus of the shot and while that device is hardly a hallmark of greatness its lively
6872641 this isnt a particularly smart movie but its a fun movie and one that delivers on the car killing mayhem its supposed to paul w s anderson may have a lot of flaws as a filmmaker but the man knows cheap thrills and he delivers them here
6872642 the structure of the story follows the familiar action movie blueprint and you can see how things will turn out for our hero and what allies or enemies he might make but for a paul anderson film its quite fun and a decent escape from the mundane
6872643 this isnt a bad movie by any stretch it serves its purpose and fills its genre role but you have seen so many films similar to this that i cant really call this film anything more than average
6872644 this mediocrity is on full display in death race which is too bad because it could have easily rocked for one thing the cast is absolutely perfect

6872673 they were better than us theres nothing more to say
6872674 theyve been playing better than us the whole tournament we have to say congratulations to them

6872676 you want to play you want to win all of a sudden you find out all of the hard work you did is going into the trash
6872677 we had an amazing first quarter and then second quarter we started fouling too much
6872678 they slowed the game down by free throws and that was our own fault
6872679 they wanted to play physical we played physical with them and i think we beat them at their own game tonight

6872807 weve had complaints from store owners and people shopping in the stores on mercer street
6872808 trying to find somebody willing to do it act as a cooperating individual is the hard part
6872809 once we get somebody we monitor the conversation we make sure theyre not going to get hurt
6872810 today so far is a bittersweet day bitter because my son and so many other kids have or had evil cancer sweet because he is doing awesome

6872812 if you could see the lives that it touches if you could ride with me for one day and see what i see youd understand
6872813 if it was your loved one that needed blood youd be the first one in line to give
6872814 it took 130 people willing to donate to save that boys life
6872815 this morning there was just a little over 100 units between the two
6872816 its one of the very few human to human gifts out there not everyone can give a lot of money to charity or do things to change someone elses life but most people can give blood and save a life
6872817 from the ashes a fire shall be woken a light from the shadows shall spring
6872818 there were big broken blocks of cement with high weeds growing in between there was glass and other things and it got to the point where it was a dangerous place people were complaining when they would come to the office
6872819 that was around the time when the main street program was going on in bluefield
6872820 we thought that we would do something similar to draw attention and raise money to build a park
6872821 several of us here in town got together and started working on it
6872822 we started with an old trailer for a stage and we provided music every wednesday
6872823 compton construction came in and did 100 000 worth of work in removing the concrete all for free
6872824 the princeton sanitary board donated top soil and many other area companies chipped in as well finally it got to the point that we could plant grass
6872825 dick was one of the leaders in making princeton town square
6872826 in addition to taking over the construction projects he also supervised the grounds and the seating for many years
6872827 there were pictures in the paper of us digging water out of holes and trying to put posts in we had a good time working together on it it just took us a while
6872828 our work just mushroomed and now its one of the prettiest places in town
6872829 we would set up the folding chairs and the tents each week
6872830 it became something i really looked forward to it was a nice break from the routine it was kind of funny sometimes us out there in our shirts and ties burning up in the sun
6872831 i spent a lot of time contacting the local daycares to come and we would have the princeton high school sports teams come watch at least once a summer it became a real community project
6872832 we have some absolutely amazing talent in and around princeton and its a pleasure to be able to spotlight that
6872833 plus sharing a lunch on the town square lawn once a week gives everyone a chance to reconnect and relax a little its a really wonderful atmosphere to have music pumping on mercer street the sun shining and neighbors all around its a piece of what being a community is all about
6872834 i particularly enjoy playing for the people of the neighborhood i think that it pumps positive energy into the downtown which is always needed
6872835 we use this property to give everyone somewhere to come and relax at noon each wednesday
6872836 it brings people in that normally wouldnt be in this part of town id like to see more people come out for it
6872837 the event provides a sense of community for the city
6872838 it provides a venue for local and homegrown talent to perform and it offers free entertainment for our citizens some of whom might not have the means to attend paid events it just really has a lot of positive aspects for our community

6872881 television needs regulators just as roads need traffic wardens but you wouldnt ask your traffic warden to give you advice on what sort of car to buy still less how to drive it
6872882 lets scrap saturday nights completely dramas out and comedy too no role for sport the champions league final euro 2008 the olympics the 14 million people who tuned into the final of britains got talent werent there to be entertained but to watch tv promote understanding of religions culture and lifestyles

6872884 i worry that weve lost sight of what makes programmes worth watching in the first place creativity imagination invention

6872890 driving across country in a peugeot would be swell but a pinto will do
6872891 i told mr bowman in october of 2001 that the only people that had the capability to do this would be those individuals working at either united states government labs or private contractors and things of this nature and it obviously seemed to me that this was u s government related
6872892 at that point i assumed good faith on the part of the fbi in this investigation because it had killed several people it had shut down the united states congress which i think was probably the greatest political crime ever inflicted on our republic in its history but then i read that the fbi had authorized the destruction of the u s governments ames strain collection
6872893 i knew a cover up was underway because legitimate scientific researchers could have taken that collection and used it to genetically re construct precisely where and when and how the weapon came from this was clearly a federal crime in its own right
6872894 i believe the first anthrax attack was designed to ram through the patriot act because senators daschle and leahy were holding it up and once the anthrax occurred it rammed right through indeed on the renewal of the usa patriot act senator feingold was holding it up and all of sudden out of nowhere some white powdered substance appeared at one of the senate office buildings and all of a sudden the renewal of the patriot act went through
6872895 they are still doing it today if you read the investigation the press conference they heard the other day it does not add up if you read the article in todays new york times it does not add up it appears that the fbi set the investigation up by scientists in such a way that no one knew exactly what they were doing they could not communicate with anyone else and only communicated with and took samples from the fbi
6872896 there is today in existence a stock pile of super weapons grade anthrax that is under the control of the original perpetrators of the anthrax attacks of october 2001 and that stock pile can and will be used again when their masters decide it would be politically convenient to scare and terrorize the american people
6872897 they could launch another attack on us including congress the judiciary the media
6872898 i think what we need to do now is insist upon a full scale congressional investigation not some type of presidential commission cover up along the lines of the 9 11 report
6872899 you also have to tie into this the large numbers of dead microbiologists that have appeared since around the summer before these events when the new york times revealed the existence of the covert anthrax weapons programs run by the cia and that too is in the public record

6872924 just as christ was sent by the father so also he sent the apostles filled with the holy spirit
6872925 this he did that by preaching the gospel to every creature they might proclaim that the son of god by his death and resurrection had freed us from the power of satan and from death and brought us into the kingdom of his father
6872926 his purpose also was that they might accomplish the work of salvation which they had proclaimed by means of sacrifice and sacraments around which the entire liturgical life revolves
6872927 they continued steadfastly in the teaching of the apostles and in the communion of the breaking of bread and in prayers praising god and being in favor with all the people
6872928 the victory and triumph of his death are again made present
6872929 if left alone businesses will eventually offer paid sick days to employees as market forces dictate
6872930 while we would hope that all ohio businesses would make paid sick days available to their employees whenever possible we believe that this initiative is unworkable unwieldy and would be detrimental to ohios economy and we will be opposing it and asking ohioans to oppose it as a result
6872931 this is me all of me i refuse to be something else just because it would be more comfortable for you it is not my job to make you happy you make you happy im gonna make me happy if we are happy together great if not move along lil doggy
6872932 there is huge waste and loss of water through food that is produced since roughly 50 percent of the food that farmers grow is lost or wasted
6872933 there is a need for a mentality shift it would make a lot of sense for people to waste less
6872934 that corresponds to 40 trillion litres of irrigation water enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
6872935 in many areas of the world you simply cannot store food efficiently because it is not handled well
6872936 in urban settings we have lost touch with realities people do not know where food comes from they do not know what it takes to produce food
6872937 now if you throw away half of that kilo that means youve thrown away 7 5 tonnes of water
6872938 unless we change our practices water will be a key constraint to food production in the future
6872939 gone down by 30 percent because the price went up
6872940 we pay a price here for water that is not very high but we also couple that with education and awareness so people know there is a cost to the environment to use that water
6872941 weve all got a kind of love hate relationship with the university of washington
6872942 affects the health safety or security of any member of the university community or the mission of the university
6872943 we have a responsibility to educate our students about being responsible citizens
6872944 we have a responsibility to introduce our students to the consequences of their actions

6873522 we have the power to do this but hows it going to be treated
6873523 it would be a federally recognized marriage that is against federal law
6873524 sovereignty is a slippery thing you cant always grasp onto if a tribe owned a nuclear energy facility they couldnt send workers in without protective gear because thats against epa regulations there are these ways in which sovereign nations must still adhere to federal rules regulations and policies
6873525 theyre only as sovereign as the u s allows them to be
6873526 you could definitely say that the hornets are cutting ties with oklahoma city thats a good way to put it
6873527 we got a mardis gras uniform were going to wear a couple of times this year and we got a bucs jersey well be wearing in the next few years well try and incorporate a third jersey
6873528 firefighter grants represent a major effort by the federal government to ensure that our nations first responders have the equipment and training they need to do the job
6873529 our firefighters are on the frontlines every day and it is critical that they have the resources to deal with any emergency or life threatening situation they may have to confront
6873530 first responders are our true heroes protecting our homes our businesses and our communities im grateful for the sacrifices they make every day
6873531 the federal government has a responsibility to protect our protectors providing them with the tools they need to do their job safer and smarter thats why i will continue to fight to provide the federal support they need to get the equipment training and resources they deserve
6873532 this 172 700 grant to the cumberland valley volunteer firefighters association is part of the federal governments effort to strengthen the nations ability to respond to fire and fire related hazards and to improve the nations overall level of preparedness firefighters give their time and energy and put their lives in harms way to protect us a man made or natural disaster in our nations capitol might call upon first responders from the entire region these grant programs are highly competitive
6873533 most of the fire companies in western are staffed by volunteer firefighters i am proud of the cumberland valley volunteer firefighters association for demonstrating how these federal grants will contribute to improving safety and our first responder capabilities for residents businesses and government installations in the baltimore washington region
6873534 grand forks air force base is a world class base with some of the air forces best personnel and the support it receives from the community is unmatched it will continue to play a key role in our national defense for many years to come
6873535 the hydrogen road tour celebrates the arrival of hydrogen as an integral part of the u s energy mix
6873536 our hyradix reformers have been producing hydrogen for sunline in thousand palms for years and demonstration projects have also featured hythane r our patented blend of hydrogen and natural gas
6873537 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
6873538 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
6873539 we rely on our eyes every time we step into a car especially our peripheral vision depth perception and focusing skills
6873540 this link between vision and driving makes it essential for motorists to take steps to maintain healthy vision just as they take other safety precautions on the road
6873541 most people are aware of the dangers of drinking and driving but are unaware that driving drowsy can be just as fatal
6873542 in fact traffic safety and sleep experts believe that drowsy driving is much more common than even federal statistics indicate
6873543 tom latham has over 800 000 in his campaign account yet he continues to hold events and send mail pieces paid for by the taxpayers
6873544 with just two and a half months to election day taxpayers are paying for latham to campaign back in the district
6873545 unfortunately tom latham has chosen to campaign using tax dollars over the august recess and he still refuses to debate with becky greenwald
6873546 these same taxpayers that are paying for his events are voters and they deserve to hear from both candidates on the issues
6873547 en fait on est en train de d couvrir l chelle plan taire que le libre change au stade actuel est un syst me perdant perdant pour tout le monde cest dire tout fait autre chose que ce que lon pensait du point de vue des pays d velopp s ce qui est tout fait fascinant cest la fa on dont le libre change nous a ramen la vieille contradiction du capitalisme qui tait celle de linsuffisance structurelle de la demande maintenant les entreprises ne pensent plus produire pour un march int rieur mais pour lext rieur elles se sont donc remises consid rer les salaires comme un co t pur quil faut comprimer je consid re que si les entreprises comme a priori l gitimes et si toutes les entreprises de tous les pays de la communaut europ enne des tats unis du monde d velopp se mettent les unes apr s les autres comprimer leur salaire vous avez ce que lon a actuellement cest dire une insuffisance de la demande globale et un monde en contraction les revenus diminuent et bien entendu les revenus de l tat vont suivre il faut tout diminuer diminuer le nombre des maternit s des fonctionnaires des enseignants tout doit suivre les revenus finalement on est dans cette logique et cette logique je dirais est celle du libre change au stade de la maturit
6873548 i dont think people understand the value of trees thats the main problem
6873549 its important that people have a respect and understanding of how the trees are contributing to us otherwise were going to continue to have these problems
6873550 think of all the beauty still left around you and be happy
6873551 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6873552 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6873553 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6873554 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6873555 the next year will hopefully bring a new opportunity to solve the healthcare crisis facing our nation
6873556 these last couple days have provided me with an opportunity to speak with people seeing the healthcare system from many different perspectives across the board people said to me dingell we want a change to the system i know what weve got to do and that is come up with a system that provides healthcare for all americans
6873557 a recent study by michigan future inc found that students who attend michigan wayne state or michigan state are the most likely to leave the state even more troubling is the fact that michigan cannot replace the students who are leaving ranking 45th nationally based on ability to attract out of state graduates
6873558 we all know that we have a great education system and some of the best universities around and the students who graduate from schools in michigan are desirable to many employers however as proud as we are of these students and the quality education they have received i know i speak for many when i say that michigan should be the state benefiting from the skills they have learned
6873559 michigan needs healthcare that protects women and families not a plan that puts them last as john mccains continuing the legacy of president bush will do
6873560 i believe in american ingenuity and our collective ability to create a new approach to health care coverage a plan that provides the american people with security and the flexibility to choose whats best for themselves and their families a plan in which private insurance companies can participate and i pledge to support any approach that will guarantee every american access to quality affordable health care currently we have 47 million uninsured in our country electing senator john mccain is not only ensuring another bush administration but also ensuring that the 47 million uninsured becomes 48 million or 49 million or more
6873561 we need to do all we can to ensure newark liberty jfk and laguardia are as safe modern and secure as possible
6873562 these funds show the federal commitment to making sure three of the busiest airports in the country have the necessary technology to meet public safety and travel demands
6873563 our airports are among the nations busiest and we must ensure they are secure these funds will go help enhance a vital layer of security that we must keep in place to ensure new jersey passengers are safe
6873564 we will continue fighting on the federal level to protect and enhance our transportation infrastructure and security operations which is vital to homeland security
6873565 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6873566 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6873567 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6873568 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6873569 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6873570 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6873571 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6873572 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6873573 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6873574 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6873575 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6873576 this is the first ill vote for a republican president or work for one
6873577 lets be clear our troops have completed every mission theyve been given they have created the space for political reconciliation
6873578 by using months old quotes and selective editing the obama ad distorts mccains assessment of the economy
6873579 it is one of the best specialty type hospitals that i have seen around the state
6873580 health care is a high priority on everyones agenda the biggest challenge right now is to make health care affordable and assessable to everyone its a big challenge but the goal should be to give people the choice
6873581 it is absolutely important because without support we would cease to exist
6873582 there are several legislators from our state that do not want to have specialty hospitals and are trying to put an end to physician owned hospitals fortunately we have people like sen cornyn to say this is a good thing for patients
6873583 sometimes in the traditional hospitals hospital administrators pressure physicians to make decisions
6873584 we feel our patients come first they deserve quality care and a choice as to where they get that health care
6873585 we speak with action by having good patient outcomes high patient satisfaction and a low infection rate
6873586 im excited that sen cornyn came to tyler and that he recognizes what a great facility this is
6873587 steve barbas extensive business background including his many years running the balsams and knowledge of the north country will serve this panel well as it examines opportunities to expand the ability to transmit power from this region of the state
6873588 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
6873589 its going to be very difficult to dislodge china the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
6873590 we regret the closure of the concord facility and have looked at different alternatives however due to volume reduction and the balance out of current platform this type of action becomes necessary to remain competitive in the industry these actions do not reflect on the performance of the concord facility the performance and the level of commitment to our customer from our workforce have been very good our employees are highly skilled and have worked hard to support our customer demands
6873591 its about that time of the year where you start looking at the scoreboard you cant let it control what you do you still gotta take care of your own business were inside 40 games and were definitely scoreboard watching no doubt about that
6873592 there are a few things behind the scenes about why we went with 11 pitchers
6873593 i always worry about it always because i dont like to overuse guys but we have a day off here and there and we were able to bring the guy from the minor leagues
6873594 i dont want to lose a position player i have to pinch run for a couple of guys with the game on the line and i need those guys out there good thing we play well and i dont have to use those guys that much its hard for me to only carry 11 pitchers
6873595 una conversaci n telef nica mantenida con uno de nuestros directivos ha desmentido taxativamente haber hecho esas afirmaciones atribuyendo el hecho a una tergiversaci n de sus dichos
6873596 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6873597 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6873598 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6873599 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6873600 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6873601 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6873602 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6873603 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6873604 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6873605 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6873606 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6873607 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6873608 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6873609 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6873610 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6873611 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6873612 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6873613 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6873614 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6873615 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6873616 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6873617 who are open to doing something on the production side
6873618 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6873619 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6873620 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6873621 he she is a really amazing person anyone would be lucky to date him her
6873622 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6873623 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6873624 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6873625 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6873626 agovinos debut investigates how people are shaped by the places they inhabit agovinos history is rich with the mythology of immigrant strivers but with its own series of twists linked to his erudite proud and reckless father the book also offers a unique portrait of the mutability of class h e strikes a nice balance between the histories of a beloved place and a turbulent family a generally engrossing narrative of class and mobility in urban america

6873637 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6873638 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6873639 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6873640 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6873641 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6873642 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6873643 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6873644 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6873645 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6873646 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6873647 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6873648 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6873649 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6873650 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6873651 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6873652 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6873653 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6873654 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6873655 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6873656 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6873657 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6873658 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6873659 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6873660 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6873661 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6873662 and youve got to be able to take a hit i dont know if he can being that tall and that lean football is a different sport
6873663 i would highly advise him to just keep doing what hes doing and reap the benefits from the talent that he has he doesnt need to be a football player
6873664 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6873665 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6873666 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6873667 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6873668 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6873669 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6873670 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6873671 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6873672 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6873673 have failed to live up to their obligations under the cease fire agreement
6873674 every day and every hour there are new proposals to change some detail

6873677 we have a trainload of wheat for armenia thats just stuck in the port

6873680 this will shame canada in the eyes of lovers of real music around the world i agree with gary above keep classical music on radio 2 and get rid of jennifer mcguire

6873682 innovation is the name of the game in this industry as it continues to evolve
6873683 by recognizing those who are developing extremely effective and creative work we know were inspiring others to drive this industry toward excellence
6873684 i had something but then would feel very insecure because a lot of these people were more cosmopolitan than me
6873685 they were from london i was from manchester we didnt have the same in built confidence that a lot of these privately educated young men and women had this ease with themselves
6873686 they would be able to talk about it and his subtext and all the rest of it and i was like oh i can do some funny voices you know
6873687 it was a kind of ordinariness of background that i realized was kind of i had an edge
6873688 what made me self conscious became the thing that made me confident
6873689 i suddenly figured that i had something more valid to say that would resonate with more ordinary people
6873690 i felt i was in touch with popular taste in a way that these other people werent and i figured that that would be my key
6873691 i went to characters that were kind of real and resonated with ordinary people and to me being popular didnt equate with being lowbrow or unintelligent
6873692 im just attracted to playing people who are ostensibly unlikable
6873693 that is not to say that there isnt something in there that makes you care it might be that you just find them so awful that you cant stop watching them like a car crash or something and theyre not self aware
6873694 i could believe him as kind of a metrosexual american guy whod lived a lot of his life in california
6873695 hes very effusive and emotionally open in a way thats not very masculine and certainly not british either
6873696 its someone who sort of waves his arms around a lot and clutches his bosom
6873697 its like he actually thinks his life is a movie thats self navel gazing which is kind of a hollywood thing a los angeles thing that sort of addiction to self analysis
6873698 im thinking about patrick today and i wish he was home with me
6873699 today is about remembering two victims whose deaths were so unnecessary and to give support to the families
6873700 she was never vetted she was not asked for a single piece of paper she and senator obama have never had a single conversation about it how would he know if shed take it

6873920 i live this time and i think about nowadays problems and not very often about the past
6873921 everybody was surprised because nobody believed that russians will come absolutely no
6873922 and the morning was half million soldiers many thousands tanks were in prague and czech republic and it was occupation
6873923 i think maybe five years maybe six years of course but not 20 i was young and i was old thats all
6873924 which meant that your life is pretty much ruined and that of course will ruin your children as well because then they were not allowed to study at the universities and they also had to do menial jobs and it was kind of total punishment
6873925 if you didnt have stamp in your i d that you are working someplace you were called a parasite of society which meant that you could be put to prison just for not working
6873926 so you had to have some job and it was difficult if nobody wanted you
6873927 they were repairing these radiators from central heating they needed to change maybe 50 but they had to ask for 100 because 50 disappeared
6873928 the entire society had its public face which lasted from monday to friday morning in which people would go along they would participate in the rituals and they would behave as though they have no problem with the communist system
6873929 it seems that everybody wants to forget that there has been a period of communism here because of bad conscience they feel uncomfortable with compromises they had to do so they pretended it is possible to do a thick line and forget about history
6873930 we are now in twentieth year of freedom after 1989 and we do not have a single novel or a single film that can compete with what was created during that period
6873931 yes we got back our freedom our democracy but maybe we didnt get the intellectual atmosphere that was so important in 1968
6873932 i wasnt afraid to go against the grain not have people accept me fully there were times i was alienated
6873933 i just knew what ever was going on was not for me
6873934 it was just so beautiful to watch that curiosity of learning and so much of what he ended up studying helped him
6873935 we had some incredible discussions of man and heredity and the environment he put his own situation in a scientific context
6873936 as ive read and heard things theres different theories the one i thought was relevant to me was because they were understandably angry
6873937 to a certain extent i was a scapegoat im not advocating what happened but it has allowed me to understand why
6873938 if you think about all the things the basic things and how many things were missing in his young life
6873939 how did he survive how did he make it to us
6873940 not only do i think im a desi but im a desi
6873941 those are friendships which have lasted for years and continue until this day

6873947 he plays just what is needed and nothing more every phrase is perfect
6873948 the songs have that radiant sense of energy to them
6873949 its like hes taken the basic workings of motown and amped them up about 10 notches the band is on fire these guys really captured the spirit of summer music
6873950 it does feel like august and it does feel very thick it starts off in a slow mood and it becomes more playful as it goes along but you sense that when these guys recorded this they were thinking about humidity that thing you cant even escape in air conditioning

6873956 do you begin to see then what kind of world we are creating it is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic utopias that the old reformers imagined a world of fear and treachery and torment a world of trampling and being trampled upon a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself progress in our world will be progress toward more pain
6873957 there was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment how often or on what system the thought police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork it was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time but at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to you had to live did live from habit that became instinct in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard and except in darkness every movement scrutinized
6873958 from where winston stood it was just possible to read picked out on its white face in elegant lettering the three slogans of the party war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength
6873959 never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling everything will be dead inside you never again will you be capable of love or friendship or joy of living or laughter or curiosity or courage or integrity you will be hollow we shall squeeze you empty and then we shall fill you with ourselves
6873960 the party seeks power entirely for its own sake we are not interested in the good of others we are interested solely in power not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness only power pure power what pure power means you will understand presently we are different from all the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing all the others even those who resembled ourselves were cowards and hypocrites the german nazis and the russian communists came very close to us in their methods but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives they pretended perhaps they even believed that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal we are not like that we know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it power is not a means it is an end one does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship the object of persecution is persecution the object of torture is torture the object of power is power
6873961 we are not content with negative obedience nor even with the most abject submission when finally you surrender to us it must be of your own free will we do not destroy the heretic because he resists us so long as he resists us we never destroy him we convert him we capture his inner mind we reshape him we burn all evil and all illusion out of him we bring him over to our side not in appearance but genuinely heart and soul we make him one of ourselves before we kill him it is intolerable to us that an erroneous thought should exist anywhere in the world however secret and powerless it may be even in the instance of death we cannot permit any deviation we make the brain perfect before we blow it out
6873962 the ideal set up by the party was something huge terrible and glittering a world of steel and concrete of monstrous machines and terrifying weapons a nation of warriors and fanatics marching forward in perfect unity all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans perpetually working fighting triumphing persecuting three hundred million people all with the same face
6873963 a hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness a desire to kill to torture to smash faces in with a sledge hammer seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current turning one even against ones will into a grimacing screaming lunatic and yet the rage that one felt was an abstract undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp
6873964 we shall abolish the orgasm our neurologists are at work upon it now there will be no loyalty except loyalty towards the party there will be no love except the love of big brother there will be no laughter except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy there will be no art no literature no science when we are omnipotent there will be no need of science there will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness there will be no curiosity no enjoyment of the process of life all competing pleasures will be destroyed but always do not forget this winston always there will be the intoxication of power constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler always at every moment there will be the thrill of victory the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless if you want a picture of the future imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever

6873997 at the moment the iphone is priced heavily but it will be more affordable in a few months time
6873998 had the price been right i would have been here to purchase the phone and not just to have a glimpse of it

6874001 headline inflation continues to be a matter of concern the point to be stressed is that the inflation rate for each group is measured on an annual point to point basis hence it is largely influenced by the trend in the corresponding week of the previous year which is the base year
6874002 global steel prices have already softened and if the trend continues it calls for a reduction in the domestic market too
6874003 the gap between domestic and international steel prices has reduced they have not come at par if the gap narrows down further we may look at revising our prices downward

6874006 there is a feeling that banks are undeservedly enjoying the unclaimed deposits while paying no interest on it
6874007 interest on saving accounts should be credited on regular basis whether the account is operative or not if a fixed deposit matures and proceeds are unpaid the unclaimed amount will attract interest
6874008 the customer should not be inconvenienced in any way just because his account has been rendered inoperative
6874009 enable customers to make informed decision regarding products and services of the bank and be aware of the rights as also the obligations of the banks to provide essential services

6874029 first the only item we seek to address is loosening existing rules to allow members to post videos as a first step toward making the rules meet our constituents expectations regarding how they communicate with us in the 21st century
6874030 they have not updated the franking regulation for the 21st century with the emergence of new technology
6874031 as long as its official then we shouldnt have overarching restrictions
6874032 i dont see them disarming themselves when those rules would not be imposed on their challengers
6874033 tell me where i can and cannot communicate with my constituents and with the american people
6874034 in my opinion the ability to use the internet videos instant messaging etc to reach constituents and make government more accessible outweighs the potential for conflict of interest in this case

6874062 you know a while back i met a young man named seamus in a vfw hall in east moline illinois
6874063 i thought of the 900 men and women sons and daughters husbands and wives friends and neighbors who wont be returning to their own hometowns i thought of the families ive met who were struggling to get by without a loved ones full income or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or nerves shattered but who still lacked long term health benefits because they were reservists when we send our young men and women into harms way we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why theyre going to care for their families while theyre gone to tend to the soldiers upon their return and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war secure the peace and earn the respect of the world

6874069 i saw your mom in moline a couple of weeks ago and at the time she hadnt heard from you for awhile so she was obviously a little worried which made me worried too
6874070 i expressed to him my pride in the troops and the work they are doing throughout iraq and afghanistan and pledged to work in any ways that i can to bring all of you guys home as quickly as possible while still finishing the job
6874071 it sounds like morale is still reasonably good but i also know how difficult and hazardous your duty must be take good care of yourself and have the best possible holiday given the circumstances of being away from home
6874072 dear seamus hadnt heard from you in awhile understandable given how busy you must be but just wanted to check in to see if you were ok hows morale over there leading up to the elections know that we are still thinking about you and that i have you and your fellow marines in mind as i am discussing issues with rumsfeld and condi rice in my new role in the senate warm regards barack obama
6874073 the next day they wouldnt come near because older adults or siblings told them not to
6874074 it took me a whole two seconds to give an answer

6874501 very likely the longest 2 meter qso via tropospheric propagation for either country
6874502 radio waves that are refracted by natural gradients in the index of refraction of air with altitude due to changes in temperature humidity and pressure refraction under standard atmospheric conditions extends the radio horizon somewhat beyond the visual line of sight favorable weather conditions further enhance normal tropospheric refraction lengthening the useful vhf and uhf range by several hundred kilometers and increasing signal strength higher frequencies are more sensitive to refraction so its effects may be observed in the microwave bands before they are apparent at lower frequencies
6874503 ducting takes place when refraction is so great that radio waves are bent back to the surface of the earth when tropospheric ducting conditions exist over a wide geographic area signals may remain very strong over distances of 1500 km 930 miles or more ducting results from the gradient created by a sharp increase in temperature with altitude quite the opposite of normal atmospheric conditions a simultaneous drop in humidity contributes to increased refractivity useful temperature inversions form between 250 and 2000 meters 800 6500 feet above ground the elevated inversion and the earths surface act something like the boundaries of a natural open ended waveguide radio waves of the right frequency range caught inside the duct will be propagated for long distances with relatively low losses several common weather conditions can create temperature inversions
6874504 went to bed at about 08 30 utc leaving the rig on and antennas pointing toward reunion i woke up at 00 15 utc and heard the beacon from my shack i went over and saw that signals were low even with the masthead pre amp on i was running cwget to confirm hard copy of the signal but it was not decoding i switched off the pre amp and returned to bed about an hour later i heard the beacon again but much stronger so i went to the shack and saw the signal at almost 1 on the s meter perfect hard copy from cwget i contacted phil on his cell phone switched the linear and pre amp on and we logged an ssb qso and fm qso on 144 200 and 144 400 at 01 39 utc on august 14 with signal reports of 5 6 both ways
6874505 at 0135 utc on august 14 glenn is calling me on my cell phone that means the beacon is heard strong enough to allow a qso its 0535 local time here i speak low and run into the shack switch off the beacon and call on 144 200 to see glenns signal at 55 56 with the preamp we decide to try fm and i have clear copy on him time goes fast we stop the qso some 20 or 30 minutes later but the band was still nicely open the signal was crystal clear almost no fading if any on my side whooaaaa the first bridge is now there between south africa and reunion island
6874506 while operating there as zr2bi in the late 1970s i heard an unidentified south american station on 2 meters since then having moved to the us i was not able to pursue it any further this last january i started e mailing a lot of people in southern africa and st helena but found little activity pursuing the potential tropo resorting to my old ways of using fm broadcast stations as beacons i asked john turner on st helena island to listen for african stations within days he reported stations from angola then namibia and eventually as far south as cape town one february day he logged 25 south african fm broadcasters in 30 minutes and that was with his car radio
6874507 all those reports led to phil mondon putting up the beacon
6874508 the best known such duct is the hawaiian duct which links the west coast of the us especially california with the big island of hawaii but we have also known that other such ducts exist in different places around the world although the ham populations in these areas are often so low that we hardly ever experience two way communications the indian ocean is one such place this outstanding contact between phil mondon fr5dn on reunion island and glen kraut zs2gk in south africa confirms the existence of a path between the mainland and islands in the indian ocean it follows the detection of fm broadcast stations on similar paths in the south atlantic ocean between the island of st helena and angola namibia and cape town on the mainland and reports of reception of brazilian fm stations on ascension island in the south atlantic
6874509 now that the path is proven many south african hams are gearing up to increase the distance over the coming southern summer

6874531 i fought him once in bulgaria and i won so this time i had to change my tactics because he already knows me i had to surprise him
6874532 i tried to do my best in the second round but my opponent was good he was using his left which was his strongest point when you are trailing with a difference of two points it is very difficult to catch up against such a quality opponent it was his day i am disappointed not to reach the final
6874533 i am happy that we have a breakthrough we finally have won an olympic medal in boxing for india our three boxers reached the quarterfinals for the first time we have shown that we are something in international boxing

6874548 at first i was thinking to have something elaborate on the floor beneath the doctor to make the first page splash really pop
6874549 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in

6874592 i am honored to have the support of the uaw after decades of failed policies mismanagement and stalemate in albany conditions are deteriorating for working and middle class families in new york its past time for a change we need new leadership in albany with the courage to make tough choices to take action and to fight for working men and women

6874594 their zone gave us problems because we werent playing good defense

6874603 republican joe robach showed his true colors when he voted for this deal just a few months ago he was touting a 2 25 million dollar budget allocation for a law school that will primarily serve students outside of the county this week we learned that robachs allocation is paid for by taking 2 million from rochesters children i have news for my republican opponent you cant go to law school unless you graduate from high school and when you have to make cuts you dont make them on the backs of our children
6874604 they come right from programs that provide tutoring programs to keep kids in school development programs to keep younger children on the right track and job training so that older kids can get jobs instead of being on the streets joe robach has said this is a win for everyone but thats simply not true its simply another sign of a dysfunctional culture in albany that got us into this mess in the first place we need somebody to stand up and say when we take money from our kids today we have to pay for it tomorrow but we dont have that voice in the state senate joe robachs silence speaks to his priorities

6874619 it was neat that our state legislators in a time when theres been a little bit of divisiveness were able to work together and pass this joint resolution unanimously
6874620 when bob getz brought this to me and told me the history of the 173rd airborne brigade i thought this was a great way to honor those who had served on our behalf and i was happy to support the initiative
6874621 i think we owe them a great debt of gratitude and this is a small honor we can give them

6874625 had the decision gone the other way it would have introduced a lot of uncertainty to capital markets particularly at a time when we dont need more uncertainty

6874662 sen mccain worked with republicans and democrats alike to form immigration legislation and while the bill didnt pass only mccain demonstrated a real commitment to reforming immigration in a way that honored our laws as well as our immigrants and traditions
6874663 and barack obama obama did not stand up obama did not speak out and when the time came for him to do the right thing he did not
6874664 obama supported measures designed to insert a deadly poison pill to kill the immigration legislation if obama didnt even have the courage to stand up for immigrants how can he claim to have the strength to change the way washington works john mccain is ready to lead barack obama is not

6874666 cheap oil the lubricant of quick inexpensive transportation links across the world may not return anytime soon upsetting the logic of diffuse global supply chains that treat geography as a footnote in the pursuit of lower wages rising concern about global warming the reaction against lost jobs in rich countries worries about food safety and security and the collapse of world trade talks in geneva last week also signal that political and environmental concerns may make the calculus of globalization far more complex
6874667 the cost of shipping a 40 foot container from shanghai to the united states has risen to 8 000 compared with 3 000 early in the decade according to a recent study of transportation costs big container ships the pack mules of the 21st century economy have shaved their top speed by nearly 20 percent to save on fuel costs substantially slowing shipping times
6874668 many economists argue that globalization will not shift into reverse even if oil prices continue their rising trend but many see evidence that companies looking to keep prices low will have to move some production closer to consumers globe spanning supply chains brazilian iron ore turned into chinese steel used to make washing machines shipped to long beach calif and then trucked to appliance stores in chicago make less sense today than they did a few years ago

6874738 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country the tax system that allows this wholesale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hardworking americans who pay their fair share of taxes we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls

6874776 di indonesia kami belajar bahasa arab fusha atau bahasa arab resmi seperti di al quran padahal di sini yang dipakai adalah arab amiyah alias arab pasaran untuk percakapan sehari hari beberapa duktur dosen suka mengajar pakai amiyah
6874777 makanya agar bisa menangkap pelajaran kami harus cermat melihat perubahan bunyi saat orang mesir berbicara karena meski berbeda pada dasarnya asal pokok kata dalam fusha maupun amiyah tidak jauh berbeda
6874778 karena sulit mencerna apa yang dikatakan dosen saya merasa kalau pergi kuliah itu hanya capek di jalan saja

6874780 pertama kali masuk kuliah saya kaget banget saat melihat di ruang kelas yang berdebu tak terurus itu dipenuhi ratusan mahasiswi bingung saya melihatnya
6874781 di kampus ini memang harus pandai memilih mana kuliah yang wajib diikuti yang sunah dan yang boleh tidak dihadiri untuk mata kuliah yang sudah saya mengerti dengan membaca diktat sendiri saya lebih suka melakukan aktivitas di luar kampus yang lebih bermanfaat

6874874 the voluntary one gave us the confidence to do the required one it was pretty successful so what we ended up figuring out over the year was that we wanted to be able to fund ourselves enough so that we wouldnt have to do any kind of pstn funding like selling dids
6874875 after a decade voip hasnt reached its potential it basically is an on ramp to the telephone network and doesnt do anything else
6874876 people have experimented with things but for the most part all the revenue models of companies like skype and jajah have something to do with extracting money based on usage charges and giving people access to the telephone network
6874877 interconnection with the telephone network shuts out the possibility of creativity content is limited to those uses justified in the context of the per minute cost of telephone service
6874878 for your regular isp you pay them a monthly fee and they attach your computer to the internet we want to be the same thing in that you buy a communication device a sip voip device and you go to a communication isp and get the thing on the internet and from there you build applications and create new value
6874879 the hard part of the argument is this bootstrap problem in other words how do we get from where we are not knowing what the applications are and not having anybody with capable devices to scale
6874880 when it started there was a very small audience and very limited content but it did have global termination for the same price and it created the virtuous cycle of content attracting more audience and audience attracting more content and the next thing you know the things growing tenfold a year
6874881 you could pay once and create a thousand so were not clamping down super hard
6874882 over the years a million people have registered so its been very hard for us to provide good service what we found was that by asking people to pay a voluntary fee it allowed us to focus on the people that actually care and create a much better dialogue
6874883 and so we think with the paid model itll be a much smaller group of people but itll allow us to focus on people that care
6874884 as long as free world dialup was still free then nobody else in the sip registration business could create a paid model
6874885 with us going to paid that gives people more options most of the people right now are doing sip registration as a way to extract some kind of pstn on ramp usage fee but if were now paid then that gives other people more options different business models that they can try

6874894 prices are dropping significantly to the point where they will become options in midrange storage systems
6874895 ssd adoption will be measured and deliberate focusing first on market segments that can tolerate the additional premium associated with ssds
6874896 one of its big advantages is that it gives increased performance
6874897 it also offers high reliability due to its physical nature and is more energy efficient as it requires less power
6874898 companies have been using hard disks for decades and ssd is relatively new so enterprises will have to learn about where they best fit in
6874899 at this point ssd products are largely aimed at enterprises looking to maximize performance of large databases and other it assets that benefit from enhanced response times
6874900 it is a specialized solution to specific kinds of problems
6874901 the technology is already going beyond the commerce and trade transaction worlds
6874902 its a certain technology that can do certain things and is proliferating behind where its been the past few years
6874903 consider that our flash based ssd line just came online in early 2007 and oems are already pulling it in
6874904 emc had invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into ssd and has called it a new permanent tier of storage that is not going away
6874905 it has to be an application centric approach and organizations have to ask what problem can they solve using this drive
6874906 the biggest issue is how to help customers understand when and where ssd solutions are ideally applied
6874907 okay my bummer for the morning i got to the gym at 3 30ish
6874908 i said good morning to my gym guy he says he has bad news the gym isnt going to be 24 hour anymore after sept 1 it will only be open 5 a m to midnight i am not sure what i am going to do i have my day arranged so that i can get everything in something is going to have to change and i dont know what there are two other gyms within a mile or so that are also 24 hour but they are both much more expensive the other thought is i stop working the part time job and go at night i just would have to go after my son goes to bed at 9 p m because i am not going to take away more time from him

6874919 weve got to win that big one to get respect
6874920 that game against southern california on sept 13 is going to determine where our season is going to go
6874921 if youre going to be a leader of a team but you never get it done its the same as saying certain quarterbacks havent won a super bowl yet
6874922 you cant make a decision to come back just on trying to get to the national championship
6874923 its something that deep in your heart those losses are going to sit with you always its more of a pact that we truly enjoy each other

6874944 we are living in a time of rapidly increasing energy prices and this is having a huge impact on people that use diesel fuel to power generators for pumping water or have intermittent utility power our company is helping to solve the energy crisis by providing reliable and affordable solutions for our customers to generate their own power with solar both in the us and the developing world
6874945 these are small parts of a very big picture after the london tube bombings and the french riots a few years back commentators lined up behind the idea that western muslims are insufficiently assimilated but in their
6874946 would argue that these incremental concessions to islam are ultimately a bigger threat than terrorism
6874947 ultimately our crisis is not about islam its not about fire breathing imams or polygamists whooping it up on welfare its not about them its about us and by us i mean the culture that shaped the modern world and established the global networks legal systems and trading relationships on which the planet depends to reprise sir edward grey the lamps are going out all over the world and an awful lot of the map will look an awful lot darker by the time many americans realize the scale of this struggle

6874965 i think any republican in this country who was asked by the nominee of our party to be their running mate would consider it an enormous honor and would accept that and do it with pleasure and pride
6874966 two republicans close to the situation say mccain has apparently settled on mitt romney as his running mate
6874967 i could be wrong but i bet he picks romney
6874968 he energizes the base romney was clearly the no 2 pick and would excite a lot of traditional republicans who think mccain is too much of a maverick
6874969 these voters will also get behind the ticket because win or lose they will see it as a setup for romney in 2012 most republicans have barely heard about most of the other names that have been bandied about they all know romney second romney is the most reaganesque of the bunch and the party is searching for any way it can find to get back to the winning days of the reagan approach hes a former governor like reagan who has ruled over a population more liberal than he is and he did it well third mccain needs an economic conservative to burnish his credentials on restoring health back to the economy romney fits there fourth romney is already vetted he communicates and campaigns well will do what hes told tirelessly he has been campaigning forcefully for mccain fifth he looks and acts like he could be president and thats 95 percent of the job of a credible vp candidate and sixth and most importantly mccain needs to nail colorado mormons and michigan home state for sure as they are in the top four critical swing states romney fits both bills

6874975 australian prime minister kevin rudd joined pacific island nations tuesday in a call for immediate help to cope with the impact of climate change in the region
6874976 for many of our pacific island neighbours climate change is a current and unfolding threat to their physical survival
6874977 pacific island countries are saying to the countries of the world including australia including the united states including the europeans including the chinese and the indians that the time for action concrete action over climate change is now
6874978 tuvalu has been crying out about the dire effects of climate change and rising sea levels but nothing concrete nothing tangible has been done to mitigate the problems that they encounter
6874979 once we have a better understanding of the odor profile we could develop sensors that could be programmed to look for the chemical compounds found in cancerous cells
6874980 conservatives continue to score points with the patriotism and military cards absurdly tarring obama as a far left opponent of american interests and security
6874981 obama appears to be a natural and longtime neoliberal centrist
6874982 any democratic presidential candidate no matter how centrist and compromising is going to be subjected to relentless charges of leftist weakness and questionable americanism
6874983 reporters are grumbling more and more that the campaign is acting like the prom queen they gripe that it is arrogant and control ling and the campaigns own belief that obama is poised to make history isnt endearing either the press certainly helped obama get so far so fast the question is how far can he get if his campaign alienates them
6874984 end of the affair barack obama and the press break up
6874985 his plans for withdrawal have long been nauseatingly ambiguous and maddeningly deceptive
6874986 the corporate sponsored capitalism praising obama is repeating the same old classist democratic mistake
6874987 the democratic leadership council dlc the organization that produced such figures as bill clinton al gore joe lieberman and terry mccauliffe has long been pushing the party to forget blue collar voters and concentrate instead on recruiting affluent white collar professionals who are liberal on social issues the larger interests that the dlc wants desperately to court are corporations capable of generating campaign contributions far out weighing anything raised by organized labor the way to collect the votes and more important the money of these coveted constituencies new democrats think is to stand rock solid on say the pro choice position while making endless concessions on economic issues on welfare nafta social security labor law privatization deregulation and the rest of it such democrats explicitly rule out what they deride as class warfare and take great pains to emphasize their friendliness with business like the conservatives they take economic issues off the table as for working class voters who were until recently the partys very backbone the dlc figures they will have nowhere else to go democrats will always be marginally better on economic issues than republicans besides what politician in this success worshipping country really wants to be the voice of poor people
6874988 the problem is not that democrats are monolithically pro choice or anti school prayer its that by dropping the class language that once distinguished them sharply from republicans they have left themselves vulnerable to cultural wedge issues like guns and abortion and the rest whose hallucinatory appeal would ordinarily be overshadowed by material concerns we are in an environment where republicans talks constantly about class in a coded way to be sure but where democrats are afraid to bring it up
6874989 and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone for 25 years and theres nothings to replace them and its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who arent like them
6874990 dont they get that the democrats are the party of the workers and the poor
6874991 race neutral obama has exhibited a disturbing tendency to eagerly join the white post civil rights majority in blaming blacks for their disproportionate presence at the bottom
6874992 you know what people really mean when they say obama is bourgeois and elitist dont you
6874993 obama supporters have been disposed to cry foul and charge racism at nearly any criticism of him
6874994 doesnt look like those other presidents on the dollar bills
6874995 carter mondale dukakis the clintons and gore did not need to be black in order to walk the same basic tiresome centrist line trod by the new black clinton
6874996 because hes white barack cant because hes black and thats scary enough in and of itself for white voters
6874997 re establishing confidence in the legitimacy of the current political order
6874998 by the end of his life king had concluded that only revolutionary change could save the u s from an ever deepening descent into repressive authoritarianism
6874999 labored with the idea of reforming the existing institutions of society a little change here a little change there
6875000 a reconstruction of the entire society a radical redistribution of political and economic power
6875001 is that he is some sort of anti establishment revolutionary rather every stage of his political career has been marked by an eagerness to accommodate himself to existing institutions rather than tear them down or replace them
6875002 the truth is that in obama a worried establishment has found the vessel through which they hope to restore international and domestic stability
6875003 elected officials are only as good or as bad as the forces they feel they must respond to its a mistake to expect any more of them than to be vectors of the political pressures they feel working on them
6875004 we need to think about politics in a different way one that doesnt assume that the task is to lobby the democrats or give them good ideas and correct their misconceptions
6875005 its a mistake to focus so much on the election cycle we didnt vote ourselves into this mess and were not going to vote ourselves out of it electoral politics is an arena for consolidating majorities that have been created on the plane of social movement organizing its not an alternative or a shortcut to building those movements and building them takes time and concerted effort not only can that process not be compressed to fit the election cycle it also doesnt happen through mass actions it happens through cultivating one on one relationships with people who have standing and influence in their neighborhoods workplaces schools families and organizations it happens through struggling with people over time for things theyre concerned about and linking those concerns to a broader political vision and program this is how the populist movement grew in the late nineteenth century the cio in the 1930s and 1940s and the civil rights movement after world war ii it is how weve won all our victories and it is also how the right came to power
6875006 we didnt vote ourselves into this mess and were not going to vote ourselves out of it
6875007 the u s presidential race impassioned almost to the point of hysteria hardly represents healthy democratic impulses
6875008 americans are encouraged to vote but not to participate more meaningfully in the political arena essentially the election is yet another method of marginalizing the population a huge propaganda campaign is mounted to get people to focus on these personalized quadrennial extravaganzas and to think thats politics but it isnt its only a small part of politics
6875009 the urgent task for those who want to shift policy in progressive direction often in close conformity to majority opinion is to grow and become strong enough so that that they cant be ignored by centers of power forces for change that have come up from the grass roots and shaken the society to its foundations include the labor movement the civil rights movement the peace movement the womens movement and others cultivated by steady dedicated work at all levels everyday not just once every four years
6875010 so in the election sensible choices have to be made but they are secondary to serious political action the main task is to create a genuinely responsive democratic culture and that effort goes on before and after electoral extravaganzas whatever their outcome
6875011 should i vote tactically for obama to block mad bomber mccain since i live in a contested state
6875012 i think im just going to sit the election out what do you think
6875013 struggling with people over time for things theyre concerned about and linking those concerns to a broader political vision and program
6875014 calm things down and re establish confidence in the legitimacy of the current political order
6875015 americans progressive opinion vs the shadow cast on society by business
6875016 affluent voters who tend to be liberal on cultural matters are about twice as likely as middle class and poor voters to make their decisions on the basis of their cultural concerns

6875022 i threw away my vote on ron paul just on impulse knowing he couldnt win
6875023 but i think obama would have a lot of trouble with the politicians who have been around for a while

6875033 ninety per cent of the work is convincing people that the eyes are real
6875034 she was not asked for a single piece of paper she and senator obama have never had a single conversation about it how would he know if shed take it
6875035 now israel claims that gaza is no longer occupied yet israeli forces patrol gazas borders by land seas and air so the point of this mission is to get two ships to sail from cyprus into gaza to challenge this illegal occupation
6875036 we still believe that an agreement can be reached by the end of the year
6875037 but theres no attempt on the part of the u s government to push the parties beyond where they believe they can go the important thing here is that both sides have committed to trying to reach an agreement its in the best interest of both peoples its in the best interests of the united states and the rest of the international community

6875062 overcome any temptation of racism intolerance and exclusion and to organize themselves with options that respected the dignity of human beings
6875063 one of humanitys great conquests is indeed the overcoming of racism unfortunately however there are new and worrying examples of this in various countries often linked to social and economic problems that nonetheless can never justify contempt or racial discrimination
6875064 one of humanitys great achievements is in fact overcoming racism
6875065 it seems to me very difficult that the words of the angelus could be referring to the italian situation especially after the precision with which the holy sees spokesman distanced it from the weekly newspaper famiglia cristiana it would be absurd that the pope would contradict the words of his spokesman
6875066 theres no doubt that there was one thing that the two parties agreed on getting rid of musharraf
6875067 musharraf stepping down at some level closes a chapter for pakistan its the last gate on the way back to democracy but that doesnt mean that democracy will be easier than dictatorship
6875068 the army wants the government to lead and take the political responsibility for going after the extremists so that the armys present unpopularity does not get worse
6875069 but mr sharif has no intention to become the cats paw of the army while mr zardari so far cannot hammer out a common coalition position
6875070 wants no concessions to the army and offers no support to the war against taliban extremists aware of his right wing vote bank he has little time for american demands
6875071 we have to also be offering a long term partnership with pakistan pakistani leaders suspect that if we succeed with al qaeda we will pull away from pakistan
6875072 weve done little to assure them that we see something beyond this very focused effort on terrorism
6875073 there is no escape from the fact that pakistan will be better off with a civilian government than a military dictatorship by and large the administration has accepted this
6875074 pakistan will become completely a democracy when there is civilian ownership of the security apparatus and foreign policy
6875075 the real difficulty for the u s is to make sure that with your actions you dont make the fragile civilian government more fragile

6875086 the equipment that were installing basically looks like a wi fi network thats geared for cellular coverage
6875087 what happens is that wireless operators will put in base stations on site and from those base stations we will transport their signals from various parts of the buildings through antenna points

6875115 this week weve taken both at meigs county high school and here at the central office a number of calls concerned about a potential outbreak of staph infection
6875116 there is one confirmed case of staph that we are aware of
6875117 its not necessarily all with athletes but athletes do use the same sports equipment they may be tempted to share a towel in a locker room and theres a lot of skin to skin contact in sports
6875118 weve taken steps to make sure everythings the way it should be and to go the extra mile
6875119 why do we fight this hard in war if we dont learn from it
6875120 they put us on what you call the hitler highway on the highway we saw massacres of people being slaughtered off the highway
6875121 you could see people of all ages hanging on barbed wire they had been shot or were being shot at
6875122 on april 11 1945 the village hottelstedt was the point of departure of the patrol of combat team 9 6th armored division u s third army which discovered the concentration camp of buchenwald
6875123 i hope that this american heros family reads these comments and knows that his sacrifice has touched people around the country and around the world in an age of hubris and ego of warfare and terrorism this humble man truly exemplifies what i would like to think being an american really stands for
6875124 people like mr hoyt are real heroes and truly show the goodness that humans are capable of this modest quiet man is now sitting at the right hand of god and he will hold that place of honor for eternity
6875125 im the last living of the first four american soldiers who liberated buchenwald concentration camp
6875126 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments
6875127 im not saying my dad was a hero to every person in the world but im saying he certainly had a heroic approach and outlook and definitely went above and beyond a persons call of duty to understand the atrocities of war
6875128 they say alls fair in love and war well some of these things werent so fair especially if you were a member of an ethnic group or cultural group that didnt suit the people of power you were scheduled to be obliterated and thats not ok thats not what democracy and freedom is all about
6875129 besides all of the horror and disbelief and shocking things that come out of war there are also the caring human sides and moral aspects of what we need to learn why do we fight this hard in war and put ourselves and others through it if we dont learn from it

6875149 i live this time and i think about nowadays problems and not very often about the past
6875150 everybody was surprised because nobody believed that russians will come absolutely no
6875151 and the morning was half million soldiers many thousands tanks were in prague and czech republic and it was occupation
6875152 i think maybe five years maybe six years of course but not 20 i was young and i was old thats all
6875153 which meant that your life is pretty much ruined and that of course will ruin your children as well because then they were not allowed to study at the universities and they also had to do menial jobs and it was kind of total punishment
6875154 if you didnt have stamp in your i d that you are working someplace you were called a parasite of society which meant that you could be put to prison just for not working
6875155 so you had to have some job and it was difficult if nobody wanted you
6875156 they were repairing these radiators from central heating they needed to change maybe 50 but they had to ask for 100 because 50 disappeared
6875157 the entire society had its public face which lasted from monday to friday morning in which people would go along they would participate in the rituals and they would behave as though they have no problem with the communist system
6875158 it seems that everybody wants to forget that there has been a period of communism here because of bad conscience they feel uncomfortable with compromises they had to do so they pretended it is possible to do a thick line and forget about history
6875159 we are now in twentieth year of freedom after 1989 and we do not have a single novel or a single film that can compete with what was created during that period
6875160 yes we got back our freedom our democracy but maybe we didnt get the intellectual atmosphere that was so important in 1968

6875188 though india is investing more on social development the disadvantaged are yet to reap the benefits
6875189 they can pay the bond which will be the amount private medical colleges charge as fees for an mbbs course
6875190 i dont know why people refer to it as rural posting most centres are in small and medium sized towns they are compared to delhi mumbai and chennai but people in big cities should get a taste of indias social reality
6875191 i dont think the bond will deter students from taking up mbbs the iits charge students rs 3 5 lakh a year but the tuition fee in government medical colleges is just rs 250 a year
6875192 we should not be here or what we are trying to do should be altered and 8230 we would need to move
6875193 if anybody is under the impression and 8230 because of this investment we would not move they are wrong

6875203 now we will focus on weeding out corruption from the judiciary
6875204 the penal action against two advocates will not change rising corruption in the judicial system unless strict action is taken against the kith and kin of judges who are able to earn millions of rupees from the very beginning of their career in profession
6875205 the strike was successful and no lawyer appeared in courts

6875208 the two pavement dwellers ran for their lives when they saw the car charging towards them they were saved by a fraction of a second
6875209 though the area is under night vigilance we keep shifting patrolling staff as per need our focus is on the roads where trucks cause maximum accidents at night
6875210 this is an area where people tend to speed at night and trees are not pruned and they block light
6875211 the floods have destroyed the yield and have caused a huge demand and supply gap prices of these items have risen a lot
6875212 the farmers have lost their yield and in places like shimla the rainfall has destroyed roads preventing smooth transport
6875213 while the rising prices had already started pinching us the recent surge has thrown our budget completely out of gear
6875214 at this rate we might have to reinvent our eating habits altogether

6875237 and he offered us the photo evidence to prove it by all accounts it looks legit
6875238 she maintains her innocence and the allegations are wholly fabricated and false
6875239 the only additional evidence we have is the victims statements and statements from school officials
6875240 this is not what we expected every time we follow up these cases with the police they tell us they are still investigating when do they ever solve the cases we know how the people hate us in this country
6875241 if the court rules that the gauteng government had done enough they are not obliged to keep the camps running that would set a precedent for us
6875242 from 9 a m this morning the fighting has intensified with both sides using a lot of heavy guns including anti aircraft guns

6875246 seventy six civilians most of them women and children were martyred today in a coalition forces operation in herat province

6875256 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6875257 i couldnt name the last four national championships losers before us
6875258 weve got to win that big one to get respect
6875259 that game against southern california on sept 13 is going to determine where our season is going to go
6875260 if youre going to be a leader of a team but you never get it done its the same as saying certain quarterbacks havent won a super bowl yet
6875261 you cant make a decision to come back just on trying to get to the national championship
6875262 its something that deep in your heart those losses are going to sit with you always its more of a pact that we truly enjoy each other

6875268 eventually were going to see a tremendous amount of waste heat recovery applications but thats 5 to 10 years off
6875269 we have to get to that 10 percent efficiency threshold to start making it viable
6875270 the market is a lot of wasted energy and that is by definition a zero cost feedstock
6875271 if energy prices keep going up the economics keep getting better
6875272 clary said appliance maker bosch has shown interest in making a home heating unit with an attachment that makes electricity from exhaust heat at 10 percent efficiency a home could meet its power needs with the heat on

6875291 breast cancer psychological distress and life events among young women
6875292 the results showed a clear link between outlook and risk of breast cancer with optimists 25 percent less likely to have developed the disease conversely women who suffered two or more traumatic events had a 62 percent greater risk
6875293 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
6875294 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6875295 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
6875296 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed

6875326 march thousands of us into the hands of the enemy they would gladly take the guns of the american military and turn them first on the american patriot rather than turning the guns of the american patriot on the enemy within
6875327 the far left in america is dominated by haters people who despise their own country
6875328 i am very proud of everything i wrote in let freedom ring
6875329 sure these guys hold some responsibility for what happened but we all hold responsibility particularly anyone who hasnt stood up and spoken out against hate speech were all contributing to the climate where people are being dehumanized because of their beliefs
6875330 the inherent worth and dignity of all people this has been part of our mission since abolitionism continuing through womens suffrage the civil rights movement and our current advocacy on behalf of gay lesbian bisexual and transgender persons

6875340 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
6875341 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6875342 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6875343 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6875344 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6875345 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6875346 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6875347 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6875348 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6875349 if you trust every web site but not a government
6875350 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official is it possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6875351 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6875352 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6875353 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6875354 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates

6875371 weve both had more than three years to put forth our very best tanker design
6875372 by coming out and saying we need another six months boeing seems to be openly admitting that their tanker does not measure up to what the air force needs
6875373 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6875374 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6875375 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science
6875376 we are hopeful that that will be the focus going forward

6875380 why permit 18 year olds to vote but not drink
6875381 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
6875382 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond
6875383 the only educational message colleges can deliver to students is dont its worth considering ways to teach young people how to drink responsibly for example by letting states create limited provisional rights

6875423 the pilot program uses our patent pending technology and reporting system with inputs from states logistics over the road activity to show carbon and emissions reduction

6875446 the canola provided a high quality grazing opportunity during a period of limited grass
6875447 the heifers came off with solid muscle tone and looking clean
6875448 the bottom line is that rain through this weekend will not fully offset august dryness deficits and it is likely that more rain will still be desired
6875449 the next rain chance for the corn belt develops during the middle and end of next week with highest chances focused on the plains and western corn belt
6875450 the remnants of fay should remain just east of soybeans in the delta though up to 2 inches is possible for its soybeans not enough to induce flooding its remnants should stay south of the corn belt
6875451 theres not a whole lot to say other than we were held hostage to the movements of the dollar once again and a little profit taking came into the market after running prices up to almost five week highs
6875452 theres going to be a cold front that passes through in the middle to end of next week but its not real moisture laden

6875464 despite a very simple question from the moderator about whether candidates supported the extension of the 2001 2003 tax cuts ashwin madia had to take two bites at the apple before partially admitting that he wouldnt support the full extension of the tax cuts in tough economic times the last thing working families and small business owners need is a tax increase and the 2001 2003 tax cuts are vital to a strong economy madias liberal roots were revealed in his failure to support the full extension of the tax cuts
6875465 sure well its election season so i guess its time for all of us to come to you and thats when politicians come to you and theyll come to you and tell you how many taxes they are going to cut or how much more money they are going to give in your pocketbook and we all come to you with our different tax cut plans and we will see who can cut the most umm im not going to play
6875466 of course i support extending tax cuts for 98 of earners in this country
6875467 the candidates agree or come close on some issues for example both oppose continuing president bushs tax cuts and both support the roe v wade supreme court decision that made abortion legal
6875468 bonoff madia appear headed for nomination fight for dfl endorsement in 3rd congressional district
6875469 im going to ask voters whether they want to continue with the borrow and spend policies of the past several years and pass on a crippling debt to their kids or whether we want to make some hard choices and try and pay down that debt
6875470 this means we all need to make adjustments on our energy use through a coordinated national energy strategy and it means that all americans including the wealthiest need to pay their fair share of taxes
6875471 to ensure the continued success of our enterprise we are constantly evaluating the size and placement of our work force including the way we staff and prioritize work
6875472 this action helps rationalize the size of our work force relative to the size of our customer base

6875477 there is a convergence of interests now in a change in the roles and missions for american forces and for reductions of troop numbers
6875478 its not done until its done and the discussions are really ongoing and ongoing and ongoing but hopefully drawing to a conclusion
6875479 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
6875480 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food
6875481 the light volumes are really sort of the reasons behind why youve got some outsize moves i think the issues over all for the economy and the market are fairly well understood
6875482 the market is of this mind set that were going to continue to be flattish to down
6875483 we need to absolutely find a bottom in financials to really believe that the bear can be behind us
6875484 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6875485 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for

6875496 he said he was unable to gain altitude and was going down
6875497 my point being that when election time comes were going to need somebody to take care of the soldiers not somebody who wants another war
6875498 this is the greatest country in the world and we cant take care of our folks
6875499 our guys did not find any powder there were maybe a couple of grains of something inside an envelope and they had to kind of work to get a sample
6875500 it was described to me as maybe they found a couple of granules of something it tested positive for protein what was described to me as a weak positive well protein could be a protein shake

6875512 bush daddy has kept pestering me about the issue of living dismemberment probably thinking that this is what it means when psalm 53 5 says that god will scatter the bones of those camping against you bush daddy says this means that the limbs of the designated target will be duct taped and cut off each time the person revives another limb will be cut off and or shortened until he or she succumbs
6875513 as i learned when i tried for an ncaa championship in 1974 sports are not worth anything with bush nazis in the works

6875521 on the other hand dumb boy could just bomb beijing and claim all the gold medals he would be the ultimate olympian he would even win the medals for team sports for they would have to forfeit the games these bush nazis can do anything that they put their sh t eaten brains to
6875522 he will guide you into all truth he will not speak on his own he will speak only what he hears or sees and he will tell you what is yet to come

6875527 let god hurry and do his work so we can see it
6875528 nothings going to happen no body is going to do nothing about it
6875529 hear this you foolish and senseless people who have eyes that do not see who have ears that do not hear
6875530 look you are trusting in deceptive words that are worthless hear o earth i am bringing disaster on this people the fruit of their schemes because they have not listened to my words
6875531 its just a little bit its not going to kill you
6875532 dr francis cheney 1848 is also eulogized as one of the notable men of early dryden and that probably explains the cheney connection at the white house
6875533 these are the sh theads you want listen to them they talk like idiots

6875541 from the current rs 77 000 crore we expect investments in sezs to cross rs 2 00 000 crore by 2009

6875543 the new indica will be launched tomorrow august 23 which is when we will share details
6875544 we were expecting some kind of a feeler from tata motors or a compromise formula from government
6875545 tatas comments appeared to have also been aimed at a budding opposition from the state unit of the congress party any congress opposition would be embarrassing for the party central leaders in new delhi especially when tata heads the trade and business advisory council of the prime minister
6875546 i request you to ask your conscience whether you support this mindless agitation that wants all development projects to stop and say no to progress
6875547 this is not our fight to save the tata factory
6875548 nano has no impact on the bottom line of tata motors in the near term and so it does not hold a lot of significance on the share prices
6875549 the singur happenings have been getting discounted over the past
6875550 the scale up of the facility however may take 6 8 months
6875551 being a low margin product no one is expecting a lot of profit from nano immediately
6875552 we have been talking to tata motors from time to time considering the sensitivity of the issue we have faith in their judgement and stay committed to the project whatever decision they take we will follow

6875555 while the whole sale price index continues to be a matter of concern and efforts are being made to address the problem through monetary steps as well as improving the supply side it will be relevant to note that the rate of inflation for the 30 essential commodities stands currently at 6 74 per cent
6875556 the players gave it their all tonight but we are just not good enough and maybe its time to move on
6875557 maybe its the end of the road for this team
6875558 there are a lot of cover ups sometimes and players need to stand up and be counted
6875559 im not sure that happens a lot at this club thats the least we should do we shouldnt have to demand it from the players they should be proud to play and give 100 per cent were not asking for miracles
6875560 we have one or two young players who have done very little in the game
6875561 they need to remember that and not slacken off they need to remember just how lucky we all are to play for manchester united and show that out on the pitch
6875562 the younger players have been let down by some of the more experienced players
6875563 they are just not leading there is a shortage of characters in this team it seems to be in this club that you have to play badly to be rewarded maybe that is what i should do when i come back play badly
6875564 the greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short but in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark

6875574 in universe we plan to keep those elements that have made the franchise a success such as adventure and humor while breaking new ground in the relationships between mostly young and desperate explorers thrust together and far from home above all we believe the stargate itself remains an enduring icon with infinite potential as a jumping off point for telling stories
6875575 if he wants to run for a third term i think its a great idea
6875576 mayor bloomberg if he wants to run for a third term i think its a great idea there was a time he wanted to run for president and that wouldnt have been a bad idea either because i cant think of another geographical location that has responded to the economic situation which people could feel coming two or three years ago better than new york city
6875577 wed love to have him around thats his decision to make by the way im running for a third term
6875578 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
6875579 as animals are considered objects in china there is little or no awareness for the suffering of these sentient beings
6875580 the cruelty found was beyond our expectations and it was hard to document without interfering it caused nightmares to the team especially in the editing room because the scenes had to be replayed and replayed to be edited from six hours down to 20 minutes
6875581 our main goal was to get this distributed because we want consumers worldwide to be aware about the cruelty involved in the fur fashion
6875582 people have a right to know that a huge percentage of fur is imported from china which doesnt have any federal laws protecting animals on fur farms people who might contribute to this atrocity by purchasing fur or fur trimmed garments need to know about the horrible suffering of the animals who wore that skin first
6875583 we want them to see how fur farmers slam terrified animals including raccoon pups on the ground and skin them while theyre still conscious people need to know what theyre really buying when they buy fur or fur trim
6875584 conditions on chinese fur farms make a mockery of the most elementary animal welfare standards
6875585 this report shows that chinas colossal fur industry routinely subjects animals to housing husbandry transport and slaughter practices that are unacceptable from a veterinary animal welfare and moral point of view
6875586 they struggle and try to fight back to the very end even after their skin has been stripped off breathing heart beat directional body and eyelid movements were evident for five to 10 minutes
6875587 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
6875588 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy
6875589 i am sure that the committee will want to look at this
6875590 this is something everyone in society will be very concerned about
6875591 i am surprised that we are taking the lead from the european commission because this is bound to delay action on this important area which is increasingly a matter for concern it seems like a bit of a cop out to me
6875592 a lot of the research is still carried out in the traditional manner using skin from the executed prisoner and aborted foetus
6875593 in china it is considered very normal and i was very shocked that western countries can make such a big fuss about this
6875594 the government has put some pressure on all the medical facilities to keep this type of work in low profile
6875595 nowadays there is a certain fee that has to be paid to the court
6875596 cosmetic procedures are a rapidly growing area of private health care
6875597 we must ensure we properly protect patients safety by improving the training and regulation
6875598 action should be taken to protect patient safety through regulation
6875599 i can see the utility of it as they have access and no ethical objection
6875600 we have come across chinese products in the market place but most products from china are being sold off label or are being imported illegally

6875779 we were eager to sell the non investment grade tranches and our risk approvals were conditional on reducing these to zero we would allow positions of the top rated aaa and super senior even better than aaa tranches to be held on our own balance sheet as the default risk was deemed to be well protected by all the lower tranches which would have to absorb any prior losses
6875780 cdo tranches sat uncomfortably between market and credit risk the market risk department never really took ownership of them believing them to be primarily credit risk instruments and the credit risk department thought of them as market risk as they sat in the trading book
6875781 we made two assumptions which would cost us dearly first we thought that all mark to market positions in the trading book would receive immediate attention when losses occurred because their profits and losses were published daily second we assumed that if the market ran into difficulties we could easily adjust and liquidate our positions especially on securities rated aaa and aa

6875888 just when you thought the bottom of the barrel had been scraped lynn goes digging
6875889 so jims heart attack was for nothing it added nothing to the plot nothing to the characterization and noting to the storyline good job lynn

6875898 todays dads dying and its funny brought to you by space aliens who reproduce by asexual division geez lynn couldnt you at least have a minion in charge of vetting each strip for connexion to reality the damn dog gets to go out like a hero beloved forever and the elderly man gets jerked around like this he isnt a plot device hes a plot voodoo doll on the plus side no matter how it works out neither jim nor iris actually have to attend the wedding proof that there truly is a silver lining in every cloud

6876025 we are obviously very concerned about reports that russia may be providing weapons weapons systems to syria
6876026 we have always said to the russians that these sales should not go forward they dont contribute to regional stability and again i urge them not to go through with these sales if there is an intent to go through with them

6876029 we do not want to quit the coalition and wish to go along with our coalition partners
6876030 the pullback of russian troops and units passed without incident and was completed on time
6876031 it is my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6876032 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6876033 i saw that announcement from the russians of their withdrawal we will continue to monitor the situation but we are not seeing that they are in compliance right now
6876034 there has been some movement of forces but whether or not that is an indication of a withdrawal or just a repositioning of forces is a bit difficult to determine at this point but those movements remain minor
6876035 it is great to be going back and im feeling really joyful at this moment
6876036 what happened was very bad and extremely painful for us this is our territory this is our country and we werent allowed to enter our own city
6876037 to crack down on criminals as we still expect there to be looters and common criminals in the city when we arrive

6876039 im so glad it is a victory to be leaving the port without the boats being sabotaged
6876040 no matter what happens we have already achieved our goal by proving that ordinary citizens with ordinary means can mobilize a defense of human rights for palestinians
6876041 we want people to see the palestinian problem as one of human rights not feeding them rice
6876042 i think we have a really good chance of making it ive got to be optimistic im nervous but excited because its about the people waiting for us on the other side
6876043 this is an effort to break the wall of silence surrounding gaza the eu and international community pretend they dont know whats happening in gaza children are starving there
6876044 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6876045 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6876046 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6876047 the balance were trying to reach is between iraqs stated desire to have a more concrete view of us forces levels out through the years and our desire it be based on conditions on the ground
6876048 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6876049 the suspicious deal means eternal bondage it violates the iraqi constitution
6876050 no no to america no no to israel we will not allow iraq to be an american colony
6876051 not counting the thousands of tons that have fallen into the sea
6876052 the dump is now like a time bomb that is going to explode with the first marine storm

6876058 this is our first time here and we hope to come back next year
6876059 i am happy to see this event in beirut after the instability of the past two summers
6876060 when the war started i was out of a job the country was frozen out of nothing i began to paint
6876061 i think the crowd is mixed between serious art appreciators and those just passing by
6876062 i like the animation the children the festival has everything for everybody
6876063 it is important to have friction between professional artists and beginners we want to help promote the young artists especially the students
6876064 there is a lot of action here this is a good ground for arts
6876065 i announce to you the good news of the martyrdom of my friend sheikh abu khabab al masri and his pious comrades
6876066 with him also passed away our brother and educator ibrahim who is the son of sheikh abi al faraj al masri may allah end his captivity
6876067 however this advancement was driven to a large extent by an appreciation in the value of imports due to increased oil prices and the depreciation of the us dollar against the euro
6876068 but when it comes to imports on which lebanon is heavily dependant this had an adverse effect as their prices went up noting that euro denominated lebanese imports are almost two times us dollar denominated imports
6876069 the increase in imports within the context of a lower rise in exports lead to slight drop in the export to import coverage ratio from 24 0 percent in the first half of 2007 to 23 9 percent in the same period of 2008
6876070 there are certain electoral reforms that need to be adopted by parliament the cabinet will not interfere in matters that need to be sorted out by parliament
6876071 political differences should not stand in the face of such services
6876072 the leasing would cost us around 2 million i insisted that my office should be in the grand serail and told siniora that the money should instead be sent to the families of lebanese martyrs
6876073 the word deputy explains itself a deputy premier should by default replace the prime minister when he is absent or unable to perform his duties
6876074 hizbullah is open to discussing all issues starting with the defense strategy
6876075 this material is very inflammable and poses a threat to the lives of the citizens we urge all citizens to be very careful when buying gas and fuel oil from any station
6876076 if the fuel oil burns quickly then this substance has been tampered with
6876077 once again is threatening to launch a new attack on lebanon forgetting that the israeli occupation was the core of the problem for lebanon and the region
6876078 did not use all means to respond in 2006 but if lebanon becomes a hizbullah state then we wont have any restrictions in this regard
6876079 will reach the cities and homes of israeli citizens and the goal of our enemy will be to hurt the home front
6876080 during the war in lebanon we had a massive capacity that we refrained from using because we were fighting a terrorist organization and not a state but if lebanon becomes a hizbullah state we will not be so restrained
6876081 retaliation is going to be earth shattering and there will be huge surprises
6876082 violence against children is a big problem in our society
6876083 the use of violence to discipline or punish children is an everyday phenomenon
6876084 workshops summer camps a best practice award and a brochure to educate children about their rights

6876086 terrorism attempted murder sectarian incitement and stealing and damaging private property
6876087 one individual got down from the vehicle and started moving toward the checkpost he was cautioned to stop and on refusal was fired upon subsequently he exploded
6876088 the vehicle was fired upon by the security forces after which the vehicle also exploded
6876089 ive been mayor for 10 years and we havent seen anything like this
6876090 its dirty politics they dont care about the people and all they care about is their interests
6876091 the petrodollar has hovered over lebanon for a long time and now it is landing and will not leave
6876092 a pair of kerouacs armed with sharpies and erasers and righteous indignation
6876093 discovered a hand rendered sign inside that i regret to report contained a few errors
6876094 i was reluctant to disfigure the sign any further still i think i shall be haunted by that perversity emense in my train whistle blighted dreams tonight
6876095 one day i was watching oprah oprah winfreys talk show and they were showing a girl cutting her hair to donate to a cancer charity i thought if i did it here in lebanon it might catch on
6876096 donating your hair is a big thing in the us but not here
6876097 to return a sense of self confidence and normalcy to children suffering from hair loss
6876098 we had had trouble finding out any information on how to donate
6876099 usually people approach us wanting to donate they give us the hair and we pass it onto eve
6876100 once ive donated my hair ill be really happy and im sure ill grow my hair again and again to donate
6876101 there are so many women here with long beautiful hair
6876102 a lot of parents idolize their daughters long hair but if they put themselves in the position of a cancer patient or their family they would realize how important donating it is
6876103 will mean a lot children should be aware of their surroundings and help out donating your hair is a very worthy cause
6876104 milestone in chinas rising international status and a historical event in the great renaissance of the chinese nation
6876105 its finding out what do i need to fix what i need to do
6876106 if its left up to me i want to play football i cant stand sitting out
6876107 if you had me cover the world series my first story might be amusing but for the rest of the games people might want to find out what was going on in the dugout in the locker room on the field thats the same for political coverage
6876108 somebody who doesnt cover politics on a regular basis might provide the side dish but not the main entr e
6876109 if you have somebody out there who doesnt know the people involved and doesnt know the players or the deputies or the campaign managers standing next to them in the lunch line then you lose something
6876110 there is an important distinction between the casual viewer and the engaged viewer
6876111 engaged viewers beginning in 1988 and 1992 could watch every moment of the convention if they desired casual viewers watched only what happened to come before them in prime time such as two or three key speeches and the official vote
6876112 today the engaged viewer has increased in large part because of the internet engaged viewers have greater access to schedules on the internet but more importantly there is so much build up for a wider variety of activities
6876113 the pace then not only seemed a lot slower as i recall but at least one or two network anchors pulled up stakes and left san diego early because there was no news
6876114 this time of course there is such intense interest in the conventions for a number of reasons no incumbent is running obamas candidacy is historic and mccain is a fascinating figure no one would dream of leaving early
6876115 welcomes an initiative by qatar for the resolution of regional problems
6876116 im pretty hard headed it doesnt bother me at all im pretty used to it im a tough girl dont worry
6876117 its a dream and a nightmare at the same time i couldnt wait until it was going to happen and now i cant believe its over
6876118 i think i performed well for what my background is and my experience
6876119 i didnt know i scored i was just concentrating on my opponent
6876120 ive learned a lot and next time ill try and close the gap between me and her
6876121 as a princess it must be very difficult for her to play taekwondo but she keeps training so i have great respect for her
6876122 i love sports i love athletes i love what sportsmanship represents the value of sports
6876123 just win or lose its very fair theres no class you know everyone is equal youre on your merit
6876124 i went to the olympic village and met with a lot of athletes i have previously met a lot of people who are here today and i admire them a lot
6876125 yesterday we were in a familys house and after they took the father away they fired tear gas canisters onto the roof and into the apartment
6876126 two little boys were sleeping there they came out crying because tear gas was fired into their bedroom
6876127 yesterday they beat up one man for trying to walk on his land
6876128 because they said he was too close to the wall
6876129 about a month ago they invaded and locked down the whole town with a four day curfew
6876130 they shot tear gas into houses that didnt keep curtains on their windows
6876131 one peace activist from israel was sent to the hospital after being shot by rubber bullets
6876132 they make us feel that we are not alone they give us solace solidarity and support and strength in our will
6876133 they did the same things to our children in the beginning
6876134 they were using many types of weapons they mixed water with gas for the cannons and had a machine that made a sound that made you fall down on the land it affects your brain they shot salt bullets and little eggs filled with tiny balls that went everywhere every night they entered the village and arrested people
6876135 a reinforcement of links between damascus and moscow amount to a very negative development
6876136 it would push syria to adopt an irresponsible and adventurist policy
6876137 would endanger peace in the world not only in the middle east
6876138 forceful return on the international stage doesnt guarantee in any way it will have a constructive role in the future of the middle east
6876139 it is difficult to believe in the good faith of moscow when it emerges despite all of moscows denials that russian weapons sold to syria have reached hizbullah
6876140 the only new element is that the israeli military aid given to georgia has given russia an argument to sell weapons to syria
6876141 has taken into account russian demands that it limit its military aid to georgia
6876142 is less important than that of the united states or france
6876143 russia has its own interests in the region and nobody wants to destabilize the region
6876144 and i think according to this assessment it is of mutual interest of russia israel and pragmatic leaders of states in the region not to send this kind of long range missiles to syria
6876145 old notes which were being printed uncontrolled by different banks had lowered the possibility of controlling money supply
6876146 we hope that with modification of the monetary system we can print higher denomination notes
6876147 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
6876148 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq
6876149 cold war sentiment supported oil prices as tensions increased between the west and russia over the deployment of a us missile system in poland sparking fears of disruption to supply

6876154 take care of your clients and they will take care of you
6876155 there is a convergence of interests now in a change in the roles and missions for american forces and for reductions of troop numbers
6876156 its not done until its done and the discussions are really ongoing and ongoing and ongoing but hopefully drawing to a conclusion
6876157 i dont think theyre necessary for my landscapes figures would trivialise or particularise them and make them paintings of something specific rather than a mood but i do have some paintings that might interest you you might find them shocking i love the old masters and was inspired by the saint sebastian works at dulwich picture gallery this image top for example just shows a small section with the arrows going into it i love baroque art the heightened emotions the ecstasy the agony the darkness of it this second work image below shows holofernes and is based on caravaggios portrayal of the beheading ive always been fascinated by beheadings there used to be a penny slot machine in brighton on the pier and the executioner chopped off mary queen of scots head when you put in a penny then the curtains came down and the head went back to where it was so it could be chopped off again maybe its a morbid curiosity in the national gallery youre surrounded by people having awful things done to them what i try to do is to focus on the most ghastly section this third painting image below is based on a small detail from rubens massacre of the innocents i dont know yet if this is a new departure or just a diversion im still influenced by the turner esque elements in landscape the underlying menace such as the dark sea with its hidden dangerous depths and the art historical thread has always been there ive always loved works that were very dramatic and used to be fascinated by paintings of beheadings and flayed bodies i taught myself to draw by copying figures from the works of the great masters so maybe im moving back to where i started
6876158 it was fun painting on a 60 foot canvas on the floor painting with brooms but it was stressful working in that environment there were always deadlines and few weekends off my progression towards sculpture was gradual first i was doing lots of pictures of stones and stone objects in the middle of the landscape such as standing stones then i visited yorkshire sculpture park and saw barbara hepworths work shortly afterwards i saw a course advertised at morley college and enrolled from then on i was really hooked i respond to the stone i start work straight into the stone rough it out remove stone quickly to give a working shape get rid of excess stone using a mallet and point then move on to a claw chisel and shape the stone more tightly after a few days i can see a bit i want to get rid of and the shape gradually emerges usually i work on two or three pieces at the same time its like a dialogue with the stone with something that has its own energy whereas with painting youre building up from a blank canvas
6876159 not sandstone because theres too much dust and you need proper masks and extractor fans not harder stones like granite because theres too much vibration too much impact on the bones i like soapstones you can get a high polish and lovely colours and alabaster and portland and purbeck limestone in 2005 the discerning eye was bought by the mall galleries and from that time on ive spent 80 of my time on sculpture maybe just doing one painting a year i think theres a spiritual quality about sculpture and i can be more abstract and personal than i could be with painting in the series touching forms for example i was thinking about the idea of relationships how people are separate but also have a joint identity the two forms appear to come together and move apart
6876160 its called the family treeo the childrens choice of title and consists of three figures a mother a father and a child for that i worked with year 9 and 10 pupils from the radcliffe school and it was officially opened in june 2008 im also helping an infant and nursery school in braintree to design mosaics and a bench for their new school garden
6876161 these numbers are more realistic than what the street had been anticipating i dont think the buy side was expecting the third and fourth quarter to be positive the sell side analysts are just slow to catch up
6876162 most of this is related to the macroeconomic environment which has forced consumers to rein in their spending
6876163 its a bear market the other sectors are going to feel it in their profits too
6876164 i think a lot of the negative earnings revision you have are due to input costs that are causing margins to compress
6876165 this is the slowest train wreck in our history everyone saw this coming but didnt really know the impact
6876166 he is a dual loyalist a foreign agent whose assignment is to get america committed to spilling the blood of her sons for client regimes who have made this moral mercenary a rich man from january 2007 to march 2008 the mccain campaign paid scheunemann 70 000 pocket change compared to the 290 000 his orion strategies banked in those same 15 months from the georgian regime of mikheil saakashvili what were mikheils marching orders to tbilisis man in washington get georgia a nato war guarantee get america committed to fight russia if necessary on behalf of georgia scheunemann came close to succeeding had he done so u s soldiers and marines from idaho and west virginia would be killing russians in the caucasus and dying to protect scheunemanns client who launched this idiotic war the night of aug 7 that people like scheunemann hire themselves out to put american lives on the line for their clients is a classic corruption of american democracy

6876177 although we had had two it staff one was more of a lower level desktop support person so in reality we only had one technically skilled network based person
6876178 if he was out of the office sick had a sick child or was overwhelmed by service calls everything else shut down
6876179 we were not comfortable having one person responsible for all of our it tasks including data protection because it was a potential liability in the event of a disaster
6876180 its a great comfort knowing the data is going out every night to a site 300 miles away rather than going down the street to the bank
6876181 the process with evault and masterit has been largely transparent to our staff the backups literally run themselves
6876182 after we started performing test restores with masterit i felt a great sense of relief
6876183 when i got the call that the data was now in atlanta and being tested regularly for restores it was quite a load off my mind

6876270 it is a fact as we all know that uncontrolled accumulation and proliferation of licit and illicit small arms and light weapons is a major threat to national and our sub regional security
6876271 however a legal regulation only in the west african sub region would not be able to stop the menace of proliferation and illicit circulation of small arms in west africa let alone africa because these weapons are easy to conceal and they are easily smuggled across borders
6876272 it is for this reason that the international community is urged to support the efforts of the ecowas member states with the necessary resources to give effect to the spirit and objective of the ecowas convention on small arms and light weapons that is to rid the sub region of the threats posed by illicit weapons and in the long term adopt an arms trade treaty that would regulate global trade in arms
6876273 unless african governments continued with efforts in the reduction of poverty on the continent and make community based development sustainable the profiteers of small arms proliferation will continue to expand their businesses to the detriment of all of us

6876399 chegando vos para ele a pedra que vive rejeitada sim pelos homens mas para com deus eleita e preciosa tamb m v s mesmos como pedras que vivem sois edificados casa espiritual
6876400 eis que ponho em si o uma pedra angular eleita e preciosa e quem nela crer n o ser de modo algum envergonhado

6876413 apabila kader sendiri yakni ketua dpc kita tidak dimajukan dalam pilkada mendatang maka keputusan yang sudah kita sepakati kemarin akan berjalan dari 22 pac yang ada 18 diantaranya sudah siap mundur
6876414 dpp maupun dpw yang selama ini merasa dirinya jago berpolitik kenapa tidak memikirkan kekuatan arus bawah aspirasi yang kita munculin harusnya mereka perhitungkan dan pantas dikedepankan sebab garis partai belum tentu dapat dimaksimalkan jika grass roadnya tidak diperhatikan
6876415 apabila partai yang berbasis islam ini takut pada pesanan pihak luar maka eksistensinya sudah tidak dapat dihandalkan lagi

6876419 it is the soldier not the reporter who has given us the freedom of the press it is the soldier not the poet who has given us the freedom of speech it is the soldier not the campus organizer who gives us the freedom to demonstrate it is the soldier who salutes the flag who serves beneath the flag and whose coffin is draped by the flag who allows the protester to burn the flag

6876421 saya harus menelan obat peghancur darah beku diotak sebanyak tiga butir yang hargaya satu butir rp 340 ribu rupiah
6876422 saya sama darwis pergi kekawasan tersebut untuk mengangkat mesin boat ketika itu
6876423 kami ditangkap dijalan sewaktu mau pulang kerumah oleh orang orang ini kami dituduh telah mencuri besi pipa pertamina padahal kami tidak tau sama sekali
6876424 seru ahyar sambil menambahkan ketika di bap oleh juper security tersebut kepalanya berulang kali dipukul dengan pentungan
6876425 saya sudah bilang kalau tidak tau perihal sembilan batang besi pipa tersebut tapi mereka security tetap bersikeras menuduh lagi pula ketika kami ahyar dan darwis ditangkap security besi tersebut jaraknya sekitar 20 meter dari lokasi penangkapan
6876426 yang pasti kami tidak tau perihal besi tersebut namun karena tak tahan terus dipukuli ahirnya dengan terpaksa kami mengakui tuduhan itu
6876427 kalau masalah penganiayaan itu kita sarankan kepada keluarga pelaku agar melapor ke polsek pangkalan susu sebab tempat kejadian perkara terjadinya diwilayah hukum polsek disana
6876428 kalau kita disini tidak ada diajarkan melakukan tindakan seperti itu tapi kalau pelaku bilang security ada melakukan penganiayaan mungkin itu cuma ngarang aja dia kalaupun ada bekas memar ditubuhnya itukan bisa bisa aja yang pasti kalaupun mereka melaporkan kita ke pihak yang berwajib kita siap aja meladeninya itukan hak mereka

6876439 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres

6876444 there are several antimicrobials that are easy to recommend for lyme patients generally
6876445 but when youre in a chronic scenario that involves a myriad of long term symptoms ranging from chronic fatigue pain and brain fog to neuropathy depression and numbness and tingling you dont want to mess around
6876446 over the past year ive seen carnivora a specific and extraordinarily potent extract of the meat eating venus flytrap plant eclipse all others in its efficacy in helping chronically ill lyme patients first find symptomatic relief and then become symptom free
6876447 this is an important observation of hundreds of people who are using the product which also is popular in the support of health by people who are battling cancers crohns disesase fibromylagia and viral and bacterial infections of many kinds
6876448 samento is superb as an antimicrobial and i recommend it highly in many instances sometimes even in conjunction with carnivora but in chronic long term cases of lyme the intent is to become symptom free while taking the fewest number of herbs possible and without breaking the bank
6876449 carnivora gets a clear nod in these cases the feedback ive heard and successes ive seen simply cannot be denied
6876450 this is all about freedom it has nothing to do with sex

6876473 im well on the record as never having approved of either margaret thatchers social or economic policies thats clear if you look at the interview
6876474 margaret thatcher could have only ever read the penguin edition of wealth of nations and she missed out the moral sentiments

6876485 bedi feels that the government ought to run programmes so that the retired policemen and ex servicemen who live all around delhi can volunteer and learn alternate dispute resolution

6876499 major corporations use blogs differently while abiding by the same rules and etiquette
6876500 individual and small business bloggers dont face the same issues for example we still need to deliver a responsible and effective corporate message but we need to do it in the complicated environment of the blogosphere we have to speak for a corporation but never sound corporate and we have to learn to do it live and in real time
6876501 there is also renewed technical selling and talk again of demand destruction the dollar is strong again too
6876502 we want to do something for the children and the men and women that fight for our freedoms

6876510 then their systems have been running without them the police the fabricated politicians the corporations we have been run by machines not by men the men have died and their machines lived on and we did not know
6876511 wed like to ask you a few questions down at central
6876512 thats for us to know and you to find out
6876513 i totally screwed that up i didnt put him in
6876514 i should be fired for that i made a mental error i ask the players not to make mental errors so i shouldnt make them myself
6876515 thats what were looking for were trying to find that guy
6876516 thats the question now guys will have certain roles its our job to put them in the right roles
6876517 i like the way aaron handled the four minute drill

6876522 the entire front line of the israeli armys brass stepped down because of the lebanon war gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him
6876523 a direct challenge to the us dominated post cold war international order
6876524 we understand the russian stance and the russian military response as a result of the provocations which took place we appreciate the courageous decision taken by the russian leadership in responding to the international initiatives and the start of withdrawing its forces
6876525 will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic demarches
6876526 we are not operating in any way which may counter israeli interests we have turned down many requests involving arms sales to georgia and the ones which have been approves have been duly scrutinized so far we have placed no limitations on the sale of protective measures
6876527 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
6876528 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
6876529 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
6876530 it was clear that too many unmistakable israeli systems in the possesion of the georgian army would be like a red cloth in the face of a raging bull as far as russia is concerned
6876531 and that the interception of three of these rpvs in the past three months was an expression of this anger not everyone in israel understood the sensitive nerve israel touched when it supplied such an advanced arms system to a country whose relations with russia are highly tense
6876532 we conducted a small job for them several years ago
6876533 the israeli is the main investor in the georgian economy everyone is there directly or indirectly
6876534 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
6876535 we are now in a fight against the great russia
6876536 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own
6876537 its important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
6876538 we need help from the un and from our friends headed by the united states and israel today georgia is in danger tomorrow all the democratic countries in the region and in the entire world will be in danger too
6876539 walking into the coliseum is a very special experience i want the players to see that

6876549 a j and i were always cool thats my boy all the linebackers pretty much hang together with the rest of the defense nobody has any animosity between any of us no kind of conflict between us
6876550 if you see the practices they may bust a play every five or six series but our defense is on it so much were so used to the speed we can read where theyre getting ready to go or what the next move is
6876551 they only break one when somebody throws a good block or something like that the offense makes you a whole lot better
6876552 i just want to play the freshman role learn as much as i can from my teammates and my coaches just take advantage of what they tell me and try to apply that to my game
6876553 theres a lot of great receivers on this team and they have so many different attributes to contribute i feel that with the opportunities ahead of me i have to take advantage of them because you only get so many
6876554 i just wanted to get out of the way because i saw him coming full speed at me
6876555 a lot of great players played before you and you have that in the back of your head while youre learning all the formations and plays
6876556 all the coaches are going to come out and challenge you with high expectations
6876557 i came all the way to usc to take care of business

6876595 the antiwar sentiment throughout the country has never been stronger to help bring greater visibility to the depth of opposition to the war in iraq on sept 20th the million doors for peace project will put thousands of people out on the streets in communities in all 50 states this massive national mobilization will send a clear message it is time to bring all the troops home
6876596 this will be the largest anti war mobilization effort of 2008
6876597 but instead of coming together in one place such as the national mall we are going to go talk to people where they live when the next congress is seated early next year we want one million people to remind them that americans strongly oppose this war and its time to responsibly end it
6876598 million doors for peace takes the anti war movement in a new direction
6876599 each year during the iraq war we have seen large antiwar demonstrations in washington and around the country this year the tactics and strategy are different instead of gathering in one place we will be in every state in the country we will meet people on their front door steps in order to expand the antiwar constituency in this country and remind our leaders of americas antiwar sentiment the cost of this war has been too great

6876662 the show has a framework but i think were doing it honestly
6876663 it was back in february and i heard somewhere that the show was coming back
6876664 the same day my agent called me in and said they were interested in me for the part of dixon i met with the original producers but heard nothing for a while then the show came under a new set of producers who got in touch and offered me the part

6876666 beverly hills 90210 was a pretty wild show which defined a generation so theres a lot of pressure on us to keep that going

6876668 i love plays and films but the stage is my biggest passion
6876669 i think we were kinda disappointed it never won anything during its run
6876670 it wasnt just a black show it was in your face reality of some of the terrible social conditions people are living under
6876671 we have learned that long time foster care is not the solution
6876672 children aging out of our foster care system at the age of 18 are often unprepared with the challenges of adulthood and are too often alone unemployed homeless or in jail
6876673 separated from my younger brother it was really impossible to maintain a relationship with my little brother he lives in san pedro while i live in compton i didnt know if we would ever contact each other again which was painful because my little brother was the closest to me
6876674 when i was 14 my world started changing my mom was trying to get our family back together but at the same time placement began to be shaky in a period of two years from 14 to 16 i went awol and was homeless on two separate occasions i lived in three different foster homes and three different group homes my grades slipped and i went to two different middle schools and four different high schools because i felt like nobody cared about me i began cutting myself to numb the pain i was told by social workers that when i get emancipated i would still get help i needed health benefits i wasnt able to get those when i was emancipated we moved to san diego and we were homeless out there and when we came back we were still homeless and i was calling my social worker who was not returning my call and i left several messages
6876675 the cost of assessment is much less than 500 per assessment
6876676 so the return value on what were doing is quite worth it
6876677 i had a baby about 11 months ago i tested positive for marijuana a social worker came to my home when i came home from the hospital the social worker said that there were some concerns with both of my children and i needed to have an assessment to see if i should participate in the drug program a staff person from shields for families came to our home and we were both her and her partner assessed shields help me enroll in a program and are now working with my family while i attend treatment everyday i have a seven year old who is picked up after school by shields staff he also receives counseling and help with his homework if it werent for shields i dont know where we would be
6876678 i have been in foster care system since i was 9 years old i have been fortunate enough to only have two placements although ive had stable placement my social workers have been anything but stable i am assuming that i have had about 50 social workers who all acted like they didnt care after 21 i stopped counting i am unable to establish a relationship because they are in and out of my life social workers are unresponsive because they dont know me because they have changed so often i never know how i am going to get in contact with them primary workers that are suppose to be the advocate of my needs
6876679 the new social worker did not understand my needs and i was constantly complaining
6876680 the greek cypriot side has most recently put forward the return of guzelyurt as a precondition
6876681 however the turkish cypriot side always fails to put forward preconditions
6876682 if the turkish cypriot people will lose everything it has following a settlement which is if turkeys effective guarantee will be removed and limited only to the right of intervention than that agreement will not constitute a settlement

6876711 but after doing some research this deception was no careless accident but rather another shameless and deliberate attempt by the campaign to reinvent and embellish the mccain family history in time for his 2008 presidential bid
6876712 i just could not let her go the only thing was i had not told my husband when i got back he asked me where will she go and i said i thought she could come to our house jun 15 2008 can we trust cindy mccain to represent american women mrs mccain has been involved in charity work from clearing landmines to starting a charity to help children who need facial reconstruction she has been inspired by her daughter she adopted from bangladesh who needed extreme care after being born with a cleft palate the adoption was prompted by mother teresa herself who implored cindy to adopt the little girl she did so without first consulting john mccain because of her compassion for the girl and her respect for mother teresa but the most damning evidence of a deliberate attempt to concoct this story comes from cached versions of the mccain campaign website heres how cindys campaign bio reads on the website as late as as an advocate for childrens health care needs cindy h mccain founded the american voluntary medical team avmt in 1988 the avmt provided emergency medical and surgical care to impoverished children throughout the world cindy led 55 medical missions to third world and war torn countries during avmts seven years of existence during one of those missions on a visit to mother teresas orphanage cindy agreed to bring two babies in need of medical attention back to the united states one of those babies is now a happy and healthy little girl named bridget mccain now compare that to the change made on the website on the same day the stories above by the sunday mail and the sunday telegraph were printed as an advocate for childrens health care needs cindy founded and ran the american voluntary medical team avmt from 1988 to 1995 avmt provided emergency medical and surgical care to impoverished children throughout the world cindy led 55 medical missions to third world and war torn countries during avmts seven years of existence on one of those missions mother teresa convinced cindy to take two babies in need of medical attention to the united states one of those babies is now their adopted daughter 15 year old bridget mccain notice the obvious change in the one sentence that depicts the circumstances of the adoption the instances of the dishonest efforts to create a mccain family portrait are growing

6876715 it demonstrates how simple but practical ways can be found to conserve water
6876716 it is time for the government to move its priorities from household waste to the far greater problem of industrial and commercial waste
6876717 the target regime for local authorities must be changed so instead of a focus only on individuals waste priority is given to ensuring businesses are doing their bit to reduce waste
6876718 this sends out entirely the wrong message at a time when reducing commercial waste both for economic and environmental reasons is more important than ever
6876719 the recommendations for action are pragmatic feasible and timely we have long called for ipr and a targeted tax regime
6876720 we hope the government responds favourably to this report by promoting repair reuse and remanufacture within both the public and private sectors

6876745 the city of londons actions remind us once again only municipal tap water delivers
6876746 at about one thousand times the cost of municipal water bottled water is simply not good value for money
6876747 the ontario municipal water association is proud of the safety of the product that our municipalities produce and deliver every day to ontarians
6876748 municipal drinking water has to meet a much higher safety standard than bottled water and is delivered at a fraction of the cost

6876761 the bears that had been on that last bit of ice that remained over shallow shelf waters are now swimming either toward land or toward the rest of the sea ice which is a considerable distance north
6876762 we have some observations of bears swimming into shore when the sea ice was not visible on the horizon
6876763 in some of these cases the bears arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple days after hitting shore
6876764 polar bears can swim quite well but they are not aquatic animals
6876765 to go out there and say they were going from this point to this point would be complete speculation

6876790 the goal of these seminars is to empower corporate relocation professionals to more effectively communicate current trends and market realities to senior leadership as well as the employees who make up their global workforce
6876791 most importantly we want participants to learn new and innovative ways to enrich their programs and control their relocation costs
6876792 todays economic pressures have forced most companies to cut back on their travel budgets limiting opportunities for corporate relocation professionals to get out of the office and interact with their peers
6876793 our virtual benchmarking sessions enable this valuable interaction at no cost making it incredibly easy to engage industry peers and discover how theyre tackling similar workforce mobility challenges without having to leave the office
6876794 i went through a divorce back then and as a middle age single person i decided to go for a condo because i was tired of yard work

6876806 were at a pretty critical time there are economicchallenges on the horizon
6876807 an election would clear the air and give a government ours or a liberal government some open waters to swim in
6876808 these programs could be used not just by first time home buyers but by anyone who needed assistance and are very popular and useful programs i estimate that this program helps 20 percent of all first time home buyers in our market
6876809 oklahoma city home prices are averaging somewhere around 145 000 which means that a borrower will need to come up with 5 000 plus closing costs to buy a home for a first time home buyer that is a lot of money as a matter of fact for most people that is a lot of money
6876810 if you price your house just a little bit below market value itll sell quickly
6876811 they think hey ill just get a foreclosure and be able to go and get my credit straightened out and buy another house
6876812 traffic why we drive the way we do and what it says about us
6876813 the most dangerous thing most of us will ever do
6876814 i just saw a report from florida that analyzed crashes on a highway over a five year period
6876815 people who were driving alone got into more crashes than people who were with passengers its another set of eyes to spot potential danger another person to see if youre falling asleep and keep you awake another human being the drivers responsible for
6876816 doctors who study diseases and epidemiology say that once you say somethings an accident it takes it out of the notion that it can be controlled or reduced or prevented
6876817 thats why the british medical journal in 2001 announced that the word would not be used in its papers on traffic statistics
6876818 i keep stories about accidents and saw one about street racing i think it was in maryland last week people were going 110 miles an hour one person went out of control and killed some spectators the word accident was sprinkled through the story
6876819 you know the famous scene from annie hall when christopher walken tells woody allen that he sometimes has dreams of swerving into the oncoming headlights of other cars and the next day hes driving woody allen to the airport and you look at woody allens face and hes absolutely petrified
6876820 this is the classic thing in traffic safety you dont want to petrify people but on the other hand you sort of do forty three thousand people a just fatalities
6876821 theres so much associated with driving romance and excitement a survey by some canadian people found that 50 percent of car commercials showed unsafe driving acts what are they selling
6876822 a couple weeks ago in brooklyn near my home someone was jaywalking
6876823 i gave him a honk as i was driving along it wasnt meant as an aggressive thing i then made a left turn and saw a parking place i got out and there was the person id just honked at it was quite embarrassing
6876824 talent management is top of mind for most organizations today
6876825 increasingly that means driving global competency throughout their workforce not just for employees on long term global assignments but also for those traveling on short term business projects or working on virtual teams these employees are under great pressure to generate successful business outcomes in short periods of time and too often they are hampered by a lack of understanding of local business practices cultural nuances or meeting protocol
6876826 this new capability truly responds to the needs of organizations and their global workforces today
6876827 the combination of high performance technology and customized training provides a comprehensive integrated approach for organizations and their employees working globally
6876828 there is no one size fits all solution to meet the needs of global workforces blended training offers the best of both worlds because it mixes high touch interventions with self service online tools that provide performance support for ongoing on the job learning
6876829 three 3 independent document forensic experts have performed extensive forensic testing on the certificate of live birth posted on obamas campaign website the forensic experts findings were the certificate of live birth colb is in fact a forgery
6876830 as stated above plaintiff as well as tens of millions of american voters democrats and persons disinclined to vote for the presumptive nominee of the republican party senator mccain will suffer irreparable harm if declaratory and injunctive relief is not granted plaintiff does not have any other way of redress regarding these very significant and important issues
6876831 however as posted all over the internet three 3 independent document forensic experts have performed extensive forensic testing on the certificate of live birth posted on obamas campaign website the forensic experts findings were the certificate of live birth colb is in fact a forgery it was further discovered that the original certificate of live birth which had been altered and forged was issued to maya kasandra soetoro born in 1970 maya kasandra soetoro is obamas half sister who was born in indonesia and her birth was later registered in hawaii the altered and forged colb is still on obamas campaign website

6876973 its an issue for a huge number of people the website basically says we are asking the fine be drastically increased and at a second offence the boat be impounded and not allowed back in the water until the exhaust is permanently fixed
6876974 as i understand it it only adds about a 5 increase so if people werent allowed to do it it isnt going to have any appreciable effect on the enjoyment of the boat
6876975 the fine is just 115 a lot of those boats spend that much on gas in an hour so its not a significant fine as far they are concerned the rcmp do their best but they dont have the resources to enforce properly

6877059 phoebus creates a bridge from legacy ip networks to new advanced optical environments enabling all types of application communities to benefit from the more deterministic quality of circuit network technology
6877060 in the longer term phoebus represents an architectural evolution of the internet in which commercial network providers can offer a richer set of services to their users because they will no longer be constrained by the performance limitations of ip
6877061 the internet2 network provides our members with a proving ground for new technology and services like phoebus
6877062 we are excited about the potential of phoebus to enable our members to experiment with and better leverage the high performance capabilities of the internet2 hybrid optical and ip network environment
6877063 to date our phoebus testing has shown dramatic performance increases even while using well tuned applications that were already achieving good performance over the ip network
6877064 for instance one ligo researcher in our region has been able to increase his application performance by over 10 times reducing the time needed to transfer a dataset that is central to his research from 40 days to less than four

6877069 i feel that my work won recognition because of the wide array of questions that can be answered by the production of these tools we can use the tools to determine if the loss of the production of these fragments is significant because more intact protein is present which can then allow for the cancer cells to become more aggressive or we can use the tools to see if the fragments themselves are able to hold the cancer cells back answers to these questions may be useful in both the diagnosis and treatment of the disease
6877070 this award is different from other travel awards in that it is a peer reviewed award
6877071 also presenting and sharing your work at events like this with colleagues who might not be in your specific field and are viewing your work with fresh eyes has the added benefit of giving you new perspectives and ideas
6877072 anti hormonal therapies are used to halt the growth of breast cancer by halting the production of growth factors and hormones that are essential for cell growth
6877073 the therapies however have been clinically shown to enhance invasive tumors
6877074 i found out that anti hormonal therapies are inducing breast cancer cell invasion by reducing the expression of junctional adhesion molecule a jam a a tight junction protein that keeps cells together like a glue because it removes the growth factors which are needed to produce the jam a protein
6877075 thus in conclusion the dark side of anti hormonal therapies is that although they are effective at reducing primary breast cancer growth they also induce breast cancer cell invasion which is the hallmark and most dangerous part of breast cancer cell metastasis
6877076 my project is cutting edge and relates to many people worldwide
6877077 this is also breakthrough research because it exposes a serious and lethal flaw in currently administered medical techniques
6877078 were very proud of all of the students involved in inbre
6877079 the delaware inbre program is aimed at building a new generation of biomedical researchers working across disciplines and partnering across institutions
6877080 i like to say that they bleed blue and gold because theyre hyper involved in everything and fantastic speakers so the combination creates a fantastic group that really presents the university in a wonderful light we think of them as our connection to families because were often unable to do what they do on a large scale and theyre really what we rely on to make those personal connections
6877081 at the time i was approached to come to ud i wasnt really thinking about a job change because i was very happy
6877082 but what really drew me here was knowing that id be able to work with students every single day very enthusiastic students who really wanted to be here thats a very contagious feeling and it makes me want to be here as well
6877083 my role really is just to make that science a little easier and more flexible for them and to tweak a few things
6877084 in anything there is always room for improvement so the goal now is to find those areas for improvement make those improvements and then find more areas for more improvements
6877085 im now involved with web page design online marketing and developing a series of online campus tours
6877086 were in the process now of developing a series of online tours in different languages and well be developing a series of online podcasts highlighting different areas of campus so as people come to admissions to our web site theyll be able to get the full campus tour experience set to selected parameters visitors to the web site also be able to access media that highlights areas of campus that wouldnt otherwise be seen on traditional tours such as specific information on athletics or selected colleges
6877087 college colors day promotes higher education in delaware through increased public awareness of our institutions of higher education and celebrates the achievements of colleges and universities in our state
6877088 we are pleased to participate in an event that highlights the enormous value of higher education and we urge students and parents faculty and staff and alumni and friends of the university of delaware to join in college colors day by proudly wearing the blue and gold
6877089 they are dedicated professionals and also involved in outreach and cooperative projects
6877090 this has been an outstanding class one proof is the excellent fellowships and jobs that have been offered to the students after graduation
6877091 the reu has truly been an amazing experience it has helped me understand issues and challenges facing disaster management across the globe it has certainly added international insights to my research and experience
6877092 reu interested me because of the drc tradition and experience in disaster research
6877093 i was working on a project dealing with the hurricane evacuation routes in delaware
6877094 i looked at the plans that delaware has in place researched the sociological side to evacuation such as how the public would behave and looked at how other states have prepared and planned for hurricanes in order to see the strengths and weaknesses of delawares plans
6877095 it has been a very good learning experience it is an environment not many engineers have experienced or ever will experience
6877096 the opportunity to meet different faculty and staff from multiple areas and disciplines has been worth the time and effort
6877097 the program has been tough but has shown great rewards in terms of experience and gained knowledge
6877098 the ud mascot team spent four days at the uca camp and during this time the team members learn everything needed to know about being a collegiate mascot performer
6877099 the camp ends with the mascot performers participating in a mascot follies for all camp students as well as parents and friends
6877100 mornings meant getting into costume and then we would be graded on our interaction with cheerleaders
6877101 we also would make signs and props for the mascot follies held at the end of the camp
6877102 not every performance routine was the same there were a lot of new mascot performers there and was refreshing to see the way they performed
6877103 it was a great experience im really proud of our team and the way we performed
6877104 the worst cover up in the history of the military
6877105 the most dangerous man to any government is the man who is able to think things out without regard to the prevailing superstitions and taboos almost inevitably he comes to the conclusion that the government he lives under is dishonest insane intolerable
6877106 no country and no people can be free and ignorant at the same time
6877107 the only safe vaccine is the one that is never used
6877108 i havent got a flu shot and i dont intend to
6877109 vaccinations only prove that you can inject someone with highly acidic toxic poisonous chemicals and that person hopefully surviving the debilitating side effects such as multiple sclerosis lesions on the brain paralysis breakdown of the red and white blood cells ulcerations of the liver lung kidney pancreas stomach and bowels seizures and death vaccinations provide zero immunity true immunity that leads to health and fitness can only be achieved by making healthy lifestyle and dietary choices
6877110 vaccinations not a virus is responsible for spanish flu 1918

6877112 national security study memorandium 2000 implications of worldwide population growth for u
6877113 aids researchers will keep their mouths shut because they are paid to do so
6877114 the origin of the aids virus is of no importance to science today any speculation on how it arose is of no importance
6877115 its distracting its nonproductive its confusing to the public and i think its grossly misleading in terms of getting to the solution of the problem its over its done with its very very very unlikely it happened that way and its another nonsense article its the worst kind of reporting as far as im concerned
6877116 the world is teetering on the edge of a flu pandemic that could kill a large fraction of the human population
6877117 an outbreak of avian influenza would kill between 5 million and 150 million people on each continent
6877118 let me be clear it is only a matter of time before we discover h5n1 in america the migration patterns of the wild fowl that carry the virus makes it appearance here almost inevitable
6877119 the current u s capacity for manufacturing egg based vaccines is not sufficient to supply our entire population hhs is supporting research into human kidney cell based vaccine manufacture of producing vaccine domestically
6877120 the fda can use its emergency use authorization authority to permit the use of unapproved products if theres a reasonable belief the products may be effective
6877121 we have approved your biologics license application bla for influenza virus vaccine h5n1 effective this date you are hereby authorized to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce influenza virus vaccine h5n1 under your existing department of health and human services u s license no 1725 however we acknowledge your statement provided in your submission of april 5 2007 that sanofi pasteur inc does not intend to license this product for commercial distribution since it was produced under contract to the u s department of health and human services as part of national pandemic preparedness initiatives influenza virus vaccine h5n1 is indicated for active immunization of persons 18 through 64 years of age at increased risk of exposure to the h5n1 influenza virus subtype contained in the vaccine
6877122 a randomized double blinded phase i ii study of the safety reactogenicity and immunogenicity of intramuscular inactivated influenza a h5n1 vaccine in healthy children aged 2 years through 9 years

6877127 our commands were created by our respective governments to respond to the defense and security challenges of the twenty first century and we both realize that these and other challenges are best met through cooperation between friends the plan facilitates the military to military support of civil authorities once government authorities have agreed on an appropriate response
6877128 i am thrilled to have karl working with me to help launch the new interdisciplinary research initiatives envisioned in the strategic plan
6877129 two of our most successful and internationally recognized programs on campus are the center for composite materials and the delaware biotechnology institute karl was instrumental in the rise to prominence of both serving first as executive director of ccm and then as associate director of dbi if there is anyone who understands the roadmap for such ventures especially the organization and infrastructure complements to cutting edge interdisciplinary science necessary for success it is karl
6877130 everybody comes here with the hope of a better life those of us with a better life have the responsibility of making their dreams come true the way other families did for ours
6877131 delaware needs to be the first state in the nation on how to deal with diversity our strength depends on our diversity we have the opportunity to be the strongest state and delaware is the template for the future of diversity
6877132 it is in the spirit of this commitment that we are honored to host the governor and other distinguished guests for the release of this important report
6877133 we need to do a lot more than we are doing today
6877134 we need to look at that report as a roadmap to what we need to do all over delaware
6877135 the challenges are great the barriers enormous and the hills are steep but hispanics are resilient
6877136 a big part of this symposium is to give students a chance to present their work and get used to having it critiqued
6877137 our students did tremendously well this year at the american society for biochemistry and molecular biology competition
6877138 ud students got six out of 16 honorable mentions and took first place in three out of the four categories in the poster competition
6877139 this symposium is the same format weve followed for several years and its working so we wont be doing much major tweaking
6877140 however for the first time this year the judges for the oral presentations are from local industries rather than the faculty members weve had in past years this is a nice community involvement and its also good because there is no question they are independent and objective panelists
6877141 lessons from wildlife new approaches to understanding environmental contaminants and health
6877142 eristostatin has been proven to stop the colonization of melanoma in the mouse model
6877143 my experiment is to figure out the mechanism involved in the prevention of lung cancer colonization by melanoma cells
6877144 my project was on identifying and characterizing a protein called hyal2 in mammalian reproduction
6877145 hyal2 is essential in allowing sperm to fertilize an egg by aiding other proteins to break down the eggs outer surface and while its been known about for a while whats not been shown is where its located in mouse or human sperm
6877146 because it could lead to discovering why some males are infertile and possibly aid in cancer research and in developing a male contraceptive
6877147 we looked at 120 newlywed couples videotaped at three points over three years while they talked about two conflict tasks one neutral task and one love task
6877148 then we went through and coded their facial expressions their voice tone and the content of their words to see what emotions were most intense we are hoping to replicate older research which has been negatively focused but were focusing more on positive responses
6877149 im really interested in couples and eventually would like to be a relationship psychologist
6877150 i think its really intriguing that theres a science behind determining whether marriages succeed or fail especially nowadays with the high rate of divorce
6877151 it was an emotional time for everyone to see friends and family waiting after two months on the road
6877152 because google has 70 percent share of the search market on the pc
6877153 signing an ad revenue deal early would give verizon an advantage over its competitors
6877154 i think this is a competitive response by verizon to the google iphone deal which has shown the right partnerships can push cell phone adaptation by the consumer
6877155 its good from a verizon standpoint because it enhances the subscriber experience
6877156 right now there are a lot of things you need to do to find what you want using a mobile phone from a google perspective they think mobile is the next big area of growth
6877157 when you look at deals like clearwire or even new 3g and 4g services its easy to see why theyd be interested in getting a foothold in the mobile data market
6877158 if at some point verizon decides not to deal with google anymore there is no reason for google to have access to data related to verizons customers
6877159 i think its a good idea for google to insist that verizon be open to android
6877160 they want to make the user experience better for the customer but they also know that having an install base on its operating system much like
6877161 advances for farm animals how and why we are winning
6877162 because time consumption is associated with emotional experiences thinking about donating time reminds people of the happiness achieved through
6877163 we argue that thinking about time activates goals of well being and beliefs involving in contrast thinking about money suppresses such emotional goals and instead activates goals of economic utility and beliefs about attainment of such goals
6877164 and that he will share details via the direct2dell blog as soon as any are made available to him
6877165 you see i thought that i had never struggled with school before so why would i struggle now i thought i would just need to work harder i didnt consider how severely my head injury had really impacted me
6877166 once semester i even forgot that i had signed up for a class and failed it so in 2003 i gave up on school
6877167 i also decided that if the drc was going to take me so seriously and not just like another case then i also would take my education and myself seriously
6877168 now i know how to study and who to go to for certain questions and problems with school because drc helped me find the resources
6877169 yes but what i really want to do is direct
6877170 thats totally cool but whats that mean to todays students and consumers
6877171 the college wanted an open and inviting place for our veterans to conduct their benefit business and receive expanded state sponsored services and a place for them to relax and enjoy campus life
6877172 we hope we have done a little to meet those goals with the new veterans center
6877173 the center makes me feel like my service was worth it and valued by others
6877174 i am very appreciative of all that has been given here to those of us who are veterans
6877175 it is nice to know this college cares about us to give us so much i have attended a few other schools and there is nothing like this there
6877176 it is important to always be looking for ways we can better serve the needs of the veterans attending slcc this new center will allow us to be a one stop support for our students using their gi educational benefits
6877177 we send a clear message to our students that they matter and we appreciate their service to our country
6877178 our customers choose verizon wireless and stay with us because we deliver on our commitment to provide the most reliable network
6877179 well continue investing in our network here in indiana as well as across the nation so that our customers can rely on their wireless phones everywhere they go

6877183 molding the team together where all the returnees transfers and freshmen become a unit
6877184 this team is very athletic and we have lots of depth in every position
6877185 all of the girls that are returning from last seasons squad have had a taste of what it takes to win these girls also saw playing time which can help to figure out our starters for this season
6877186 we have a good group of new athletes coming into the program which could complement the returning players if the players can mature and reach their full potential they have the ability to be as good as last years team
6877187 i look forward to a very competitive and successful volleyball season with our team returning to the national championship
6877188 having lindsay win this award shows the strength or the region nationally
6877189 this is a big award and it was such an honor to receive this award it just made me realize that all my hard work has paid off
6877190 having lindsay win this award is really big for our recruiting we believe that we are recruiting division one athletes and it shows that you can come to slcc and accomplish all these individual goals before moving onto a division one program
6877191 its better because you dont have to worry about nobody swerving over and drivers blowing the horn at you because you are in a bike lane
6877192 i think its safer because when a car gets behind you and another car coming down the other side they dont slow down
6877193 weve both had more than three years to put forth our very best tanker design
6877194 by coming out and saying we need another six months boeing seems to be openly admitting that their tanker does not measure up to what the air force needs
6877195 the very business model of independent investment banks is coming under fire
6877196 this is a reminder that the days of the standalone investment bank are numbered and that they must increasingly align themselves with universal banks to survive
6877197 this is not a toronto community this is a small community and its going to have an impact on the community itself
6877198 trying to replace a lot of jobs in this type of community its not likely to happen
6877199 i think theres ample room for nuance to sweeten the bid given its an all stock offering and theyve got cash on the balance sheet
6877200 i dont think it is imperative but it is something that could be incremental to their business model long term
6877201 advanced stages of negotiations on the terms of a strategic transaction
6877202 we concluded that the nuance offer did not reflect the true value of zi and that the potential transaction we announced yesterday would not only in itself add value to zi it would also position zi to potentially realize even greater value for shareholders
6877203 zis refusal to negotiate is perplexing and inappropriate given the compelling premium our proposal represents to zis market price and the liquidity opportunity it will create especially in light of the disappointing financial performance and cash outlook zi reported last week
6877204 the fact that we erased all of yesterdays gains so fast suggests that were still in a bear market theres just not much demand out there
6877205 the dollar got pounded yesterday and everybody rushed to buy commodities as a safe haven now the dollar is strengthening so everybodys dumping commodities again
6877206 obviously yesterdays rally was overcooked and were simply taking back some of that speculative risk premium we injected into the market
6877207 the fact that we erased all of yesterdays gains so fast suggests that were still in a bear market theres just not much demand out there
6877208 the dollar got pounded yesterday and everybody rushed to buy commodities as a safe haven now the dollar is strengthening so everybodys dumping commodities again

6877212 obviously yesterdays rally was overcooked and were simply taking back some of that speculative risk premium we injected into the market
6877213 we have nothing against the technology we just dont want that delivery system
6877214 they seem to think our community is their open job site
6877215 i wanted to give myself the time to heal so that when i go out there again i was really ready to give whoever i am with the respect and total attention she deserves
6877216 no matter how we won i know where the trophy is
6877217 we had a great points weekend winning in michigan and we will carry the momentum into bristol and focus on gaining as many points on the series leader clint bowyer
6877218 crew chief todd lohse has a good handle on the setup you need to run well at a short track like bristol and with the toyota horsepower underneath us i think we have a good shot at being there at the end again this weekend
6877219 para m se trata de una persona que tiene conocimiento de lo que est haciendo porque esto no es de un ni o es algo realmente impactante porque las patas le colgaban a este animalito lo cort entero el alambre le cercen todas las extremidades
6877220 yo nunca hab a visto algo as me impact con esto es impresionante la maldad que se hace con los animales encuentro que las personas que hacen eso no tienen coraz n o nunca se han arrepentido realmente a veces nos molestan tambi n es cierto pero llegar a hacer esto es algo realmente extremo
6877221 encontramos un acto criminal y que efectivamente es denunciable y que podr a ser sancionable judicialmente
6877222 hemos visto casos como ste que est n amarrados a un huachi hemos visto casos en que se les ha hecho cortes con cortaplumas hachas o disparos nosotros queremos recabar m s antecedentes para instaurar alg n tipo de acci n legal para quienes resulten responsables
6877223 creo que un gatito no merece ese tipo de trato y no me cabe ninguna duda que quien realiza este tipo de acto es gente inadaptada y entre hacer esto con un animal dom stico y hacerlo con otro ser humano no hay mucha distancia y eso es lo preocupante
6877224 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
6877225 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned
6877226 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
6877227 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all

6877297 breast cancer psychological distress and life events among young women
6877298 the results showed a clear link between outlook and risk of breast cancer with optimists 25 percent less likely to have developed the disease conversely women who suffered two or more traumatic events had a 62 percent greater risk
6877299 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
6877300 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role

6877320 i dont want a political label but obama bears traits that resemble the anti christ and im scared to death that un educated people will ignorantly vote him into office my mom likes him because his children are well dressed you see what bothers me most besides that he is a communist and a whitey hater although he is half white is that he is a liar he pretends to be a christian and he incriminates himself everytime he speaks about christianity to lie about being a believer in christ is very dangerous lightning could strike him at any minute but seriously he doesnt have a clue what the bible says and yet he pretends to be a church going christian to win votes that is sooooo evil

6877326 the growing number of lupus clinical trials and the rising level of interest among people with lupus about clinical research led us to the decision to create this new center
6877327 we have already seen an increase in demand for people with lupus to serve as study volunteers at the same time people with lupus have voiced frustration in finding trusted information to make informed decisions about joining a trial the ccte will help meet those needs
6877328 whether to participate in a clinical trial at a given time is a very personal decision
6877329 sometimes it makes sense to participate if current treatments aren t working if there are side effects of the treatments a person is taking or just because it s clear that without clinical trials there won t be progress in treating lupus but not everyone is a candidate for a clinical trial people need to talk to their doctor but also do their homework to learn as much as they can about what s involved before they volunteer for a clinical trial the lupus foundation of america s ccte provides a way for them to get that information from a source they trust

6877394 en lo que respecta al desarrollo de inversiones el ctricas la situaci n actual muestra un mercado altamente interesado en ampliar la oferta por las buenas perspectivas de la demanda pero con fuertes dudas de tipo econ mico y tecnol gico frente a la incertidumbre externa que enfrenta nuestro mercado de gas natural esta incertidumbre se manifiesta en la imposibilidad de predecir la evoluci n de los precios tanto libres como regulados para el largo plazo dado que se desconoce si la realidad del mercado del gas natural volver a ser lo que fue hasta hace un a o atr s por ello es necesario generar condiciones de estabilidad en las condiciones de mercado sobre las cuales se planifican las nuevas inversiones en el sector de modo de atenuar la incertidumbre importada desde el mercado de gas suministrador
6877395 la incertidumbre descrita no es equivalente al riesgo natural que enfrenta la inversi n en cualquier mercado operando en condiciones de competencia

6877397 esta necesidad se sustenta en la constataci n de que algunas caracter sticas de los proyectos y de parte importante de sus promotores impiden asumir los riesgos asociados a la comercializaci n final de la energ a de igual forma que los proyectos y emprendedores tradicionales debido a ello estos proyectos tienen menores posibilidades de suscribir contratos de largo plazo con clientes finales no sujetos a regulaci n de precios o empresas distribuidoras para la venta de su energ a y por consiguiente no pueden optar a modelos de negocios que les otorguen certidumbre de ingresos durante plazos prolongados condici n fundamental para desarrollar proyectos que se caracterizan por la recuperaci n del capital invertido en el largo plazo

6877406 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6877407 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6877414 with the advent of the 990cc machines this was initially greeted with many uncertainties related to the competitiveness of the machines but soon we saw an escalation of the dizzying performance which led to a reduction in engine capacity all in the name of safety of the riders as the power looked as if it was going to be difficult to manage since the switch you watch the stopwatch and now the times are equalling the 990cc machines but the intervention of important electronics has helped here security and safety is a factor to which the team riders dorna and irta have given more and more attention
6877415 certainly suspension and tyres hold a crucial role and must work in balance with each other and particularly in the light of the benefits that we have with todays tyres the set up of the bike has to be made very carefully it is no less important the role of an engine but with the advent of the four strokes the electronic management is the core in order to maximise the performance of the bike tyres and suspension
6877416 yes its true but you can reach a good final compromise in general we try to develop a balanced motorcycle whose base is exploitable on all circuits for sure it is better to have a bike which is adaptable than one which gives 100 but only under certain conditions a rider of talent is an element that integrates into this context and he may be able to cover any gaps in the bike and ride around problems
6877417 the preparation of the bike does not change too much as you might think with regard to the overall geometry of the bike
6877418 it was determined to check one of the cranks because of things that could be seen by looking in the cases thats my understanding
6877419 we only did one because the three bikes were teammates in retrospect we probably should have pulled the cranks of all of them but theres nothing we can do about that at this point because we only pulled the winner
6877420 i dont know for sure how that decision came to be i guess because it was the winning bike but absolutely thats the one thing we would like to change which would be to have pulled all three cranks because obviously it asks more questions right
6877421 i appreciate and understand why people might connect the dots on this one but there was no intent there was no opportunity taken advantage of
6877422 thats not how we do things thats not how we want to do things going forward the efforts that the team makes to succeed should be respected were putting on an entertainment we need to make sure the competitors trust us that its our goal to put on a good and safe and fair show i get it why people think that but theres no agenda on our part

6877454 we believe the development of owner to owner relationships with merchants is an important factor to an offices success
6877455 individual sales reps that have never run a business are not in the best position to understand the challenges a business owner faces our individual office owners will know what it takes to run a business so they will be able to advise based on experience not based on a standard sales model

6877683 our blokes are certainly capable of participating in a fast game hugh mcmeniman has the added benefit of being able to play in the middle row it is going to be dry hopefully it will be a fast game
6877684 matt doesnt have the background of game time that al has so we are looking to him to go hard and for as long as he can
6877685 he is obviously an experienced prop he was the incumbent prior to injury so we have no issue there in terms of what he brings hopefully the wheel will spin for a while
6877686 set pieces are critical in our last contest we performed well in the set piece but we are very conscious that that has no meaning on this saturdays game other than it was a learning experience what happened to us in auckland
6877687 both sides will be working hard to gain ascendancy i suspect it will be an even contest
6877688 there has been a lot said about the breakdowns in recent weeks and normally when that happens teams address those areas but it will be an important area if you look at what happened in perth we possibly did okay there in that instance
6877689 without a doubt south africa will be looking to address that area so that will mean that it would be tough the next time
6877690 i was definitely surprised to be selected at number three
6877691 i thought al has been scrummaging and playing exceptionally well come scrum time hes met the challenge of whoever hes faced
6877692 i think hes also done more than that in a lot of the games aerobically round the paddock hes been a fantastic athlete
6877693 so i was surprised at a run but robbie deans has asked me to get out there and be combative and scrum well so ive just got to get out there and perform
6877694 he is an excellent scrummager and an excellent player so well have to scrummage very well to combat that hes also super fast i know that much i hopefully wont have to match up to him on the wing
6877695 i didnt really have to say much we had a lot of experienced players like anton oliver carl hayman josh blackie craig newby all those kinds of players and i was just used to everyone doing their job
6877696 being a younger player i didnt really have to say too much but now ive come back into the harbour team and ive realised im one of the senior players and i have to start leading some of these younger players and trying to boss them around as well telling them what to do
6877697 i wasnt used to it but after the third game into it i am starting to take to it
6877698 i have to know what kind of effect a decision would have on the team and i have to execute it properly so there are not extra mistakes
6877699 i have been putting a lot of hard training in prior to the npc because i really wanted to have a good season this year
6877700 if sione lauaki and liam messam are playing and with aled demalmanche they are very strong ball runners they probably watched the bay of plenty game and the bay team really took it to our forward pack and theyll try to beat us up up front and use their backs
6877701 its really good to have someone with his experience back in the team hes a great defender and when he puts a couple of hits in he can rough the team up
6877702 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
6877703 bobby knight told me this there is nothing that a good defense cannot beat a better offense in other words a good offense wins
6877704 pena que n o tenha sido pelos melhores motivos nem com o conte do que eu desejaria
6877705 oi meu fui ver o filme y porreiro fixe posta qualquer coisa
6877706 se verdade que todos temos direito ao labor e ao produto da nossa subjectividade n o menos verdade que tal s pode acontecer a partir da defini o de um espa o de alguma objectividade processual a partir do qual possamos pensar partilhar e confrontar pensamentos

6877708 the best picture of 1981 tells the true story of british athletes preparing for and competing in the 1924 summer olympics in paris at 123 minutes the film clocks out as a sprawling epic and is recognized by critics as one of the best sports movies ever made this film was a given which is why i failed to include it in the original list
6877709 i love barack im telling you hes a wonderful guy
6877710 then just tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it
6877711 there were no positives in these data a collapse in investment a contraction in household demand and a fall in exports
6877712 the uk looks almost certain to head into recession in the coming quarters things will be considerably worse in 2009
6877713 for years gordon brown has boasted of consecutive quarters of economic growth now economic growth has ground to a halt and browns bubble has burst
6877714 we are now seeing the full extent of the self delusion which led ministers to believe that everything was well with the british economy
6877715 we are not sure at all how they did it but they have got some serious explaining to do i can only imagine what they must have thought when they saw it sink to the bottom of the sea
6877716 they had managed to get themselves onto rocks and were unhurt but their problems have only just begun somewhere out here is a rich sailor who forked out a fortune for a boat which never arrived
6877717 they told us it was imported from america so the owner has obviously been waiting a while for his new boat they were too close to the coast and hit sharp rocks and it never stood a chance the bottom was shattered completely
6877718 we tried to drag it to the beach but it sank they the delivery men did not hang around and they got the first bus to southampton and looked very worried they were gutted as you would be if you had just crashed someone elses powerboat worth more than most people will ever see

6877727 our canadian system strikes the perfect balance between two intrinsically canadian ideals namely freedom of speech and abhorrence for hate and intolerance
6877728 my game has just improved so much over the last couple of months with the big change in my ball striking
6877729 the only concern remains my putting as i again missed some opportunities unfortunately but its nice to be in the hunt again its nice also knowing that i am not playing to my full potential and i still have a chance to win
6877730 its a traditional old style course and even though were only playing it at a par 70 it is still very challenging
6877731 though im not about to get ahead of myself and it will be still a case of taking everything nice and slowly and one step at a time
6877732 its great for poker in asia that theres a major tournament like this here in macau

6877737 o pt conseguiu um grande aliado que foi o ex prefeito gilson menezes isso pode tornar a disputa mais f cil em rela o aos pleitos anteriores

6877762 this potent new immunomodulator which is in the same class as thalidomide and lenalidomide will hopefully be successful in treating patients who have relapsed or who dont respond to currently available treatment options we are excited to be testing pomalidomide in this context and are optimistic that it will meaningfully add to our therapeutic options for our patients
6877763 this new clinical trial brings the total number of studies that the mmrc has initiated to fourteen we are thrilled to advance this study in our mission to identify and prioritize the most promising treatments for patients with multiple myeloma

6877769 the growing number of lupus clinical trials and the rising level of interest among people with lupus about clinical research led us to the decision to create this new center
6877770 we have already seen an increase in demand for people with lupus to serve as study volunteers at the same time people with lupus have voiced frustration in finding trusted information to make informed decisions about joining a trial the ccte will help meet those needs
6877771 whether to participate in a clinical trial at a given time is a very personal decision
6877772 sometimes it makes sense to participate if current treatments arent working if there are side effects of the treatments a person is taking or just because its clear that without clinical trials there wont be progress in treating lupus but not everyone is a candidate for a clinical trial people need to talk to their doctor but also do their homework to learn as much as they can about whats involved before they volunteer for a clinical trial the lupus foundation of americas ccte provides a way for them to get that information from a source they trust

6877795 my gut instinct is that there will be a wide disparity about what rates are quoted on these sites and what they actually end up with and not necessarily due to the borrower
6877796 all the sites may not collect all the data thats necessary to give an actual price quote

6877825 a civilian project to monitor illegal aliens crossing the border
6877826 got 3 more at least three shot trying to cross u s mexico border our people are now actively shooting illegal aliens and we will continue to do so when planning this activity it was decided that the shootings would take place on the mexican side of the border since law enforcement in that nation is so ill equipped the chance of getting caught is zero
6877827 we will continue to shoot illegal aliens as they try to cross the border until the stench of blood and rotting corpses discourages further illegal attempts to enter this country
6877828 we have been pretty well demonized but since april of 2005 i dont believe anyone has been injured by anyone under the blanket name of minutemen

6877834 the border is a picket line and everyone who comes across and works off the books for less than minimum wage is a scab simple as that if you dont have a physical barrier you will have to have people out here on duty almost linking arms for 2 000 miles to keep people out
6877835 it wasnt only illegal aliens they were dong just like out of grapes of wrath
6877836 passing out little pamphlets about great jobs wonderful opportunities then they had the company store for ten dollar cigarettes and three buck beers the workers were in debt at the end of the week and hadnt paid their bills

6878284 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6878285 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6878286 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

6878289 the peace corps has been in touch with our state department and the liberia folks and it looks like were going to start moving some teams pretty quickly back into liberia
6878290 the government of liberia requests the re establishment of the peace corps program in liberia we understand that the peace corps has a program peace corps response which allows experienced volunteers to serve for short periods to perform high impact work such short term projects aimed at raising the capacities and capabilities of liberian teachers would have a profound impact upon civil society as a whole
6878291 were pleased to see so many positive developments in liberia as well as the countrys renewed focus on education the peace corps is proud to continue the agencys legacy of providing education volunteers to liberia and to be able to contribute to the countrys development efforts

6878303 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6878304 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6878305 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6878306 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6878307 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6878308 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6878309 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

6878315 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6878316 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6878317 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6878318 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6878319 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

6878322 the special court against terrorism in sudan is a caricature of justice
6878323 some of those sentenced yesterday met with their lawyers only during the first part of the trial while several of them claimed to have suffered torture when they were isolated and were forced to confess to crimes
6878324 the government of sudan has an obligation to investigate crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice but must do so according to international law and its own constitution with guarantees of a fair trial
6878325 we call on the sudanese authorities not to execute these men and to review their cases immediately in accordance with the laws of sudan

6878332 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6878333 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6878334 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6878335 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6878336 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6878337 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6878338 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6878339 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

6878345 its sad to see flair advertised for some low rent wrestling shows at this stage of his life
6878346 he should really be above that i dont know what his take will be in 12 months but unless its significantly above the half million dollars he was making from
6878347 im not saying flair shouldnt take advantage of his earning potential right now and i hope he makes millions in whatever he does but seeing him in these ads for every rinky dink out there just makes him look ancient instead of being relevant which he still can be
6878348 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6878349 fails to give assurances that current laws about abortion will not be stretched to cover birth control
6878350 this proposal ensures that doctors and other medical personnel will retain the constitutional right to listen to their own conscience when it comes to performing or participating in an abortion
6878351 these regulations will ensure that pro life medical personnel will not be forced to engage in the unconscionable killing of innocent human life
6878352 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6878353 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6878354 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience
6878355 by the definition in w 4 9001 a same sex ceremony can never be a marriage
6878356 im sure that we will press the parts of the spahr decision that supports my presiding at the wedding and calling brenda and nancys relationship a marriage we see a lot of positive things in the spahr decision
6878357 w 4 9001 is definitional in nature only and contains none of the language that the book of order instructs must be present to set forth a mandate or a prohibition
6878358 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6878359 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6878360 el funcionamiento de la corte primera de lo contencioso administrativo fue muy cuestionado

6878363 los jueces de la corte primera de lo contencioso administrativo fueron destituidos por razones estrictamente pol ticas a fin de dar paso a otros jueces cercanos al oficialismo y al ideario pol tico del actual gobierno

6878366 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6878367 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6878368 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6878369 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6878370 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6878371 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6878372 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6878373 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6878374 fear of switching is the foundation of customer loyalty for pcs
6878375 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6878376 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

6878396 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6878397 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6878398 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6878399 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6878400 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6878401 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6878402 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6878403 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6878404 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6878405 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6878406 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6878407 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6878408 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6878409 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6878410 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6878411 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6878412 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6878413 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6878414 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6878415 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6878416 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6878417 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6878418 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6878419 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

6878421 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6878422 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6878423 we hope you had as much fun playing our game as we had making it
6878424 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6878425 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6878426 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6878427 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6878428 my wife and i just got back from 3 weeks in thailand and found your backpacks to both of good design and good quality and would gladly recommend them to anyone regards bob

6878432 content is very useful and great to have a local product
6878433 the fda will soon be allowing the irradiation of spinach and iceberg lettuce in order to combat e coli
6878434 if any organization wishes to take credit for denying this choice i think they should also bear the burden for the deaths of people who did not have that choice i know thats a strong statement but i believe that very deeply
6878435 what you want to know is is michael colby a responsible guy very
6878436 i think michael colby is doing the public a hell of a service and i dont care if he goes what i think is a bit too far i think we owe him a big debt
6878437 when it comes to challenging controversial technologies theyre not going to go head to head with corporate america
6878438 they feel much more comfortable going after popcorn in movie theaters or chinese takeout
6878439 they hate us im not going to lunch with them im not having a conference call with them thats the difference
6878440 there have been major companies that have indicated an interest in using food irradiation and food amp water would respond with threats ads in the newspaper
6878441 its been effective food amp water has been the principal group that has stopped the use of food irradiation
6878442 we dont like the idea of having dirty food on which bacteria have been killed
6878443 we feel that food should be safe and clean it would be very tempting for the food industry to have very sloppy practices and then to cover that up with a blast of radiation at the end of the line
6878444 ive never seen michael colby show a risk assessment that this is really a significant risk
6878445 eating contaminated poultry is not a speculative risk it is a known risk there is a real problem
6878446 im a current opponent until the proponents agree to do the proper tests and so far they wont do them
6878447 i think the fda is off base on this and theyve never gone back to review it
6878448 the mere presence of a free radical has no significance
6878449 they are correct in that you cannot prove irradiated foods are safe
6878450 but in reality you cannot prove anything is safe you can only prove absence of harm
6878451 theres this mentality that believes the truth has to be in the middle and if youre taking some extreme position then you have to be wrong somehow
6878452 most of the luxuries and many of the so called comforts of life are not only not indispensable but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind
6878453 somehow weve got to block the lurch toward globalization it does not work for the food supply
6878454 urban centers like boston are going to have to figure out ways to support rural areas around them and develop a symbiotic relationship there are ways to do that cities used to consist of tight knit communities with small stores and small businesspeople there was a real sense of community and cohesion and a respect for things local thats been totally obliterated by wal mart home depot and the rise of industrialized food these are the things we have to challenge if were going to save ourselves

6878457 the complexion of the company has changed now tata tea ltd ttl is no longer a plantation company it is more of an fmcg company
6878458 now we have 42 brands in 45 countries we shall go for acquisition which will give us access to new technology and footprint in new countries
6878459 the opposition particularly the trinamool congress is trying to turn singur into another nandigram it is for you all to decide whether you are for development or the politics of destruction
6878460 of the 12 500 landowners whose lands have been acquired nearly 10 000 have collected their cheques under a democratic set up this shows what people really want when the atal bihari vajpayee led nda government embarked on building the durgapur expressway we did not oppose the acquisition of land we did not even raise a hue and cry when vajpayees photographs were put up along the highways
6878461 police were informed and we found the two dead at the bathroom door of the hotel room with froth in their mouth
6878462 it is a case of suicide as we have recovered two suicide notes which say that no one be held responsible for the consequences of their action
6878463 suppose the tatas say they need one acre to set up an office premises it will be okay if they return 399 acres
6878464 i havent seen the tv programme i shall react if i must only when i have read tomorrows newspapers
6878465 we dont want any untoward or violent incident to take place at singur it is my appeal that their agitation should be peaceful we want peace and no one should indulge in violence they trinamool congress leaders who met the chief minister on wednesday promised me that their agitation would be a peaceful one i hope they will keep their word
6878466 there wont be any problem if the agitation is done in a democratic manner
6878467 its very clear what the people want from the results of the panchayat elections
6878468 cps are much more efficient short term instruments in the capital markets rates have been increasing over the few months the rates for 90 day paper appear to have touched 11
6878469 we believe that even if some banks start to cut lending rates in the next six months the overall borrowing costs will remain high until last quarter of fiscal 2009
6878470 this is the minimum delay one should expect that too if the tatas decide to shift to one of their existing plants and if they shift to an all new location the delay can be substantial
6878471 if tata motors moves out we have no option but to follow them
6878472 we have to suffer a loss as things like land and building cannot be moved anywhere
6878473 we are not sure what will happen there we will only put up a plant at singur if the situation improves otherwise we will supply to the project through our other plants
6878474 if they move out we will be at a considerable loss a withdrawal by tatas would leave us with no option but to also move out
6878475 when negotiating for business with such a big company such kind of a clause is not possible the losses would entirely be borne by investing companies our agreement is not with the tatas but with the state industrial body wbidc
6878476 when barack obama was selecting his closest advisors he told each person he wanted zero drama meaning no backstabbing damaging media leaks or anything that would detract from the campaign
6878477 obama emphasized his grassroots approach by bringing organizers onto the stage as well
6878478 like a tough law professor obama will call on staffers who havent spoken up
6878479 national finance chairman penny pritzker said obama decided he wanted to run the campaign like a disciplined business
6878480 if hes happy you know it if he prefers to do something different you know it says valerie jarrett an obama campaign advisor
6878481 the idea for obama university a unique training program for first time fundraisers came not from campaign leadership but from three supporters
6878482 he wants to see disagreements aired in front of him

6878484 la informaci n se difunde en los estados financieros de dos formas dentro del cuerpo del balance y en las notas explicativas el sistema considera estas notas tan v lidas como el resto de los antecedentes uno de los cambios importantes son precisamente las notas de segmentos que ser n tan estrictas que nadie podr pretender no comprender lo que se est pidiendo si las empresas las redactan inadecuadamente podr an ser descalificadas para postular a cualquier proyecto captar accionistas solicitar cr ditos etc de esta forma una nota mal redactada no podr competir con empresas de otras partes del mundo que s cumplieron ahora esto ser leonino porque dichas notas indicar n a la competencia aspectos in ditos hasta ahora ocultos y reservados de las empresas como las reas de donde sale el dinero habr que definir el motivo de por qu se estructur de esa manera y no de otra lo cual implica informar sobre estrategia es algo que no es voluntario es una informaci n que te obliga que te encajona para dar a conocer las utilidades el producto de la venta los costos los gastos financieros con una transparencia impresionante
6878485 todo lo que hice en ese per odo no servir de nada a contar del 2009 ir directo al tarro de la basura porque el pa s tendr que asimilarse al sistema internacional
6878486 nos hemos organizado en varias comisiones y estamos orgullosos de decir que hemos avanzados mucho y que llevamos un 64 por ciento de la tarea terminada en estos momentos hay tres bloques de normas en difusi n hacia las empresas estas se despachan y las organizaciones las devuelven con indicaciones que si corresponden son consideradas en la redacci n final
6878487 con la implementaci n de las nuevas normas ifrs las empresas ver n afectados sus par metros de c lculo de remuneraci n variable producto de cambios en el registro y medici n de ciertos elementos de sus estados financieros y la presentaci n de los mismos
6878488 las empresas deber an comenzar a preocuparse del problema integral que tendr n con la adopci n de las niif ifrs que no es menor e implica no s lo la adopci n de las normas sino el reemplazo de sus sistemas y la capacitaci n del personal
6878489 la svs y otras entidades que deben pronunciarse sobre c mo se aplican estas modificaciones a n mantienen indefiniciones sobre puntos sustanciales por lo que nos parece que ser dif cil tener un diagn stico preciso sobre este tema
6878490 creemos que el uso frecuente del valor justo bajo ifrs puede crear volatilidades importantes como en los instrumentos derivados los cuales podr an afectar los dividendos de las compa as
6878491 no cuentan con muchos profesionales que realmente manejen o hayan llevado a cabo procesos de implementaci n de ifrs
6878492 americas heroes at work really focuses on the employment challenges of our returning veterans from the war on terror if they are living with a brain injury or living with a stress disorder
6878493 we know that a number of our servicemembers are coming back with some level of brain injury as a result of blast injuries or successive blast injuries or may be coming back with stress
6878494 we know its a significant enough issue that we want to pay some serious attention to it
6878495 employment plays absolutely a major role in the rehabilitation of our servicemembers regardless of the kind of injuries that they may have
6878496 northern ireland was beautiful and the people were very friendly
6878497 ill never forget the lovely girls with their rosy complexions
6878498 the day before the invasion of europe d day we rallied to hear gen eisenhowers encouraging speech i can still feel the anxiety and apprehension as we put on our chutes for our first jump into combat enemy fire was everywhere as we jumped right on top of german positions
6878499 we had double bunks with loose straw on bare boards
6878500 many of us were getting weak and sickly i became very ill and was sent to a medical ward with double pneumonia when i left the ward my eyes would go out of focus the condition lasted until i got back to the usa
6878501 it acts as a powerful reminder to me of the hardships i shared with other americans in that camp since that time i have never left the smallest morsel of food on my plate
6878502 dad has continued the adventure after his retirement his wanderlust has taken him and my mom to so many places

6878505 i don t think that most chicagoans are really aware that this law is as foolish as the anti foie gras law that was recently rescinded
6878506 residents need to be aware that we have specific rights including the right to have the dog we want of the breed we want and the right to keep it intact as long as we are responsible
6878507 i have always voluntarily altered my dogs and cats for a variety of reasons
6878508 in the good old days the choice of when to neuter my animals was always left up to my family and myself not the government
6878509 the reality is that it will have no effect on these problems instead it will create some serious public health concerns cause many animals to be denied necessary health care and will trample on the personal property rights of conscientious pet owners
6878510 if a dog becomes a danger then confiscate it and fine the owner
6878511 there are both positive and negative affects accrued from sterilization
6878512 it appears that benefits outweigh risks however there are many breed and individual dog variants suggesting that professional judgment is required to determine whether and when to neuter spay pets
6878513 i am working with several national dog organizations such as the international kennel club and i am supporting the illinios state veterinary medical association and the chicago veterinary medical association in opposing this proposed law
6878514 i am also working closely with several hobby breeders to rally the public to our cause the bottom line is that testicles don t bite people untrained dogs owned by idiots bite people educate the dog and the owner and dog bites don t happen
6878515 it was a very close knit friendship with one ideal to help the jews
6878516 he got really angry but i told him if youre angry we wont make a deal

6878536 barack obama is more similarly situated to bill clinton in 1992 than any other candidate in recent history
6878537 bill clinton was a new candidate on the national scene he was running in a
6878538 obama will correct his underperformance with hillary clintons primary votes and emerge with a muh more cohesive base
6878539 this convention gives obama a platform to unite his base
6878540 his holiness told kouchner that there is a certain form of brutal repression that continues parallel to the olympic games
6878541 we have the responsibility to take care of this planet
6878542 we must extend love to all creatures trees and beautiful things
6878543 the only guiding principle of sarkozys policy towards china appears to be not to displease beijing
6878544 but we were quickly disillusioned our envoys came up against a wall there was no opening
6878545 the pullback of russian troops and units passed without incident and was completed on time
6878546 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6878547 if needed we reserve the right to boost these forces
6878548 i do not believe that these actions can seriously contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in the region
6878549 seventy six people all civilians and most of them women and children were martyred during the operation by coalition forces in shindand district of herat province
6878550 19 women seven men and the rest children all under 15 years of age
6878551 the interior ministry while expressing its profound regret because of this incident which happened by accident has sent a delegation of 10 people to the area and more details will be announced once the investigation is completed
6878552 i definitely do not have any reports of a large amount of civilian casualties and we dont have any reports of civilian casualties at all
6878553 planes bombed the area and in the result 25 taliban were killed including two famous commanders
6878554 unfortunately five civilians were killed and one woman and a boy were wounded
6878555 we have asked the pentagon to allow a six month timetable for submittal of proposals in this competition
6878556 the reason were asking for that is since the issuance of the draft request for proposal rfp two weeks ago as weve engaged in our discussions with the pentagon and theyre asking for a different kind of airplane than they asked for in the first competition
6878557 if we dont get the sufficient time to prepare that proposal theres really little option for us other than to no bid in this competition
6878558 the proposal will have the specific timelines in it im not going to get into it now and whether or not a company desires to compete is entirely up to them
6878559 we have taken what the gao has told us what they have recommended for us to do which in the scheme of the overall proposal were relatively minor but important addressed all the concerns that the gao raised
6878560 it views any delay to the amended request for proposal for the tanker replacement program as harmful to the warfighter and that a delay will result in a direct escalation in cost to the government thereby harming american taxpayers
6878561 this is a new competition make no mistake about that the requirements have changed
6878562 steven has had two injuries he was 10 15 days without training and then it happened again
6878563 clearly in a couple of weeks he will be back to his best he has needed time to get fit after his injuries and it has been important to protect him
6878564 steven has great game intelligence and he can play anywhere gerrard played with intelligence and england drew that is all i would want to say about it
6878565 we know what is the best position for gerrard but he is capable of playing in other positions
6878566 we know where he can play really well and we know where he likes to play we will concentrate on using him to his strengths
6878567 we hope fernando can create his piece of club history and then maybe more in the future
6878568 we talked about the players that we have how to progress and we both know it is important for the club that we work together
6878569 we are working really hard we are moving in the right direction and hopefully we can do something positive in the next few days
6878570 the talks were positive we cannot discuss names but we are now both working to improve our squad
6878571 there was no friction but some personal problems now things are more clear and that is positive it was a private conversation
6878572 i have had no word about arsenal wanting gareth barry and that is all i want to say on the subject other than that we are working towards improving our squad
6878573 likewise there has been nothing more on xabi alonso at the beginning of the summer we were looking at ways of raising money but now we are happy with xabi he is a very good player
6878574 the offer we had was not good enough so why would we want to sell him
6878575 we have had an approach from stoke about sami but we want to keep him
6878576 when we talked about a new contract in the summer it was clear that sami wanted to stay at the club

6878578 breast cancer psychological distress and life events among young women
6878579 the results showed a clear link between outlook and risk of breast cancer with optimists 25 percent less likely to have developed the disease conversely women who suffered two or more traumatic events had a 62 percent greater risk
6878580 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
6878581 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6878582 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
6878583 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed
6878584 to some its a mountain of garbage but for others its a gold mine
6878585 i get excited every time i see a street cleaner
6878586 the charges relate to the repeated sexual assault of a former altar boy on the states south coast

6878588 i cannot recall if he was the parish priest or the assistant priest
6878589 i express deep sadness concerning allegations of abuse by a retired priest of the diocese
6878590 i thought about the idea of psychological tourism and taking people to sites that can really enhance the psychological concept that you are trying to impress at the time
6878591 the idea is to look at a smorgasbord of things that would be useful for you in a great learning environment and follow you for 12 months after that with periodic emails to see how you are going in terms of the goals you have set
6878592 i came back and my normal 30 minute walks in the morning started to become about not so much walking the dog or exercise but about quiet time in my head about walking meditation about breathing exercises
6878593 within an organisational context there is research to say that people who have high levels of wellbeing and happiness have higher supervisory ratings within their appraisal systems and they have greater levels of organisational citizenship and they receive higher incomes
6878594 first we want to have the local community embrace it then the national community and then the international community
6878595 we think this can be a way of further defining the features of the illawarra employment creation is important to us because we want to be part of a great and healthy community
6878596 i just had the flu and my mum being a mother was very worried and mindful of what was going on
6878597 i had a heat rash and she thought that was meningococcal so she took me in on saturday night
6878598 the next day i got up too quickly and then i fainted so that was it it wasnt anything serious it was just a matter of drinking fluids
6878599 they had me on a saline drip for most of the morning which i didnt like very much because i dont like needles and it wasnt exactly the way i wanted to spend my sunday
6878600 i only have eight photos in my portfolio when most models have a full book so its really difficult to get the industry interested when you have really got nothing to show them
6878601 it was a relief to discover what was wrong and to know she would make a full recovery
6878602 to their credit the medical team at wollongong hospital did everything they possibly could but tick paralysis is very difficult to diagnose because its so uncommon in people
6878603 parents should know that this could happen to their child
6878604 if their child is listless and experiences any weakness in their limbs they need to know that it could be a tick
6878605 lies and defamatory statements have been spoken about our family who were clean living community minded people who were more interested in helping others
6878606 kathryn and gregs reputations were questioned and the offender blackened their names yet again this week

6878699 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6878700 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6878701 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6878702 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6878703 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6878704 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6878705 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6878706 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6878707 the file pregexp cl is a machine translation of pregexp scm that runs in common lisp
6878708 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6878709 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6878710 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6878711 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6878712 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6878713 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6878714 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6878715 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6878716 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6878717 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6878718 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6878719 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6878720 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6878721 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6878722 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6878723 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6878724 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6878725 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6878726 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6878727 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6878728 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6878729 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6878730 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6878731 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6878732 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6878733 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6878734 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6878735 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

6878756 weve had complaints from store owners and people shopping in the stores on mercer street
6878757 trying to find somebody willing to do it act as a cooperating individual is the hard part
6878758 once we get somebody we monitor the conversation we make sure theyre not going to get hurt
6878759 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6878760 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6878761 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

6878764 today so far is a bittersweet day bitter because my son and so many other kids have or had evil cancer sweet because he is doing awesome
6878765 this first year has been challenging but hes done so great we are so very thankful for that
6878766 if you could see the lives that it touches if you could ride with me for one day and see what i see youd understand
6878767 if it was your loved one that needed blood youd be the first one in line to give
6878768 it took 130 people willing to donate to save that boys life
6878769 this morning there was just a little over 100 units between the two
6878770 its one of the very few human to human gifts out there not everyone can give a lot of money to charity or do things to change someone elses life but most people can give blood and save a life
6878771 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6878772 ostranenie magazine strives to be a venue for all creative and critical work the magazine published semesterly attempts to reflect the topography of creative culture and the work being made right now our goal is to publish work in an arena that supercedes genre as editors our only agenda is to promote abstract culture we do this by providing a physical document of work to share with each other lay as a foundation and synthesize different creative and critical niches so that creative and critical endeavor can evolve
6878773 to be a part of the editorial staff and help put the magazine together send an email about your interest to samizdatpress gmail com we are looking for people interested in the tradition of samizdat self and independent publishing diversification and degentrification of the literary magazine and being a facilitator of the artistic intellectual and critical dialogue it wouldnt hurt if you were also versed in photoshop indesign or were generally computer literate although really it is the drive to act that we want we can teach you the skills
6878774 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6878775 this is a planning took where all things are going
6878776 you pose an elevated risk of live abuse against children which is plainly evidenced by material seized from your home
6878777 that material shows the depths and extent of your perverted sexual thinking
6878778 from the ashes a fire shall be woken a light from the shadows shall spring
6878779 there were big broken blocks of cement with high weeds growing in between there was glass and other things and it got to the point where it was a dangerous place people were complaining when they would come to the office
6878780 that was around the time when the main street program was going on in bluefield
6878781 we thought that we would do something similar to draw attention and raise money to build a park
6878782 several of us here in town got together and started working on it
6878783 we started with an old trailer for a stage and we provided music every wednesday
6878784 compton construction came in and did 100 000 worth of work in removing the concrete all for free
6878785 the princeton sanitary board donated top soil and many other area companies chipped in as well finally it got to the point that we could plant grass
6878786 dick was one of the leaders in making princeton town square
6878787 in addition to taking over the construction projects he also supervised the grounds and the seating for many years
6878788 there were pictures in the paper of us digging water out of holes and trying to put posts in we had a good time working together on it it just took us a while
6878789 our work just mushroomed and now its one of the prettiest places in town
6878790 we would set up the folding chairs and the tents each week
6878791 it became something i really looked forward to it was a nice break from the routine it was kind of funny sometimes us out there in our shirts and ties burning up in the sun
6878792 i spent a lot of time contacting the local daycares to come and we would have the princeton high school sports teams come watch at least once a summer it became a real community project
6878793 we have some absolutely amazing talent in and around princeton and its a pleasure to be able to spotlight that
6878794 plus sharing a lunch on the town square lawn once a week gives everyone a chance to reconnect and relax a little its a really wonderful atmosphere to have music pumping on mercer street the sun shining and neighbors all around its a piece of what being a community is all about
6878795 i particularly enjoy playing for the people of the neighborhood i think that it pumps positive energy into the downtown which is always needed
6878796 we use this property to give everyone somewhere to come and relax at noon each wednesday
6878797 it brings people in that normally wouldnt be in this part of town id like to see more people come out for it
6878798 the event provides a sense of community for the city
6878799 it provides a venue for local and homegrown talent to perform and it offers free entertainment for our citizens some of whom might not have the means to attend paid events it just really has a lot of positive aspects for our community
6878800 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6878801 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6878802 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6878803 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6878804 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6878805 we are issuing this alert primarily for those who may obtain red hat binary packages via channels other than those of official red hat subscribers
6878806 one of the compromised fedora servers was a system used for signing fedora packages however based on our efforts we have high confidence that the intruder was not able to capture the passphrase used to secure the fedora package signing key

6878816 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6878817 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6878818 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6878819 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6878820 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6878821 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6878822 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6878823 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6878824 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

6878873 watched streaming video of an olympic event on their computer or cell phone during the first five days of the beijing games
6878874 nbc did however have a very odd deal with local cable distributors that either cut certain viewers out
6878875 or at least made them be dishonest in order to watch coverage when first logging into the video area viewers must provide a zip code and local nbc cable affiliate certain local cable operators did not make deals with nbc for online coverage if you picked the wrong provider you got an apology and no video
6878876 i will say i dont believe the live flash video experience would have been as quite as good as the vc 1 streams were seeing in the silverlight player
6878877 however thats only because nbc would have no doubt implemented on2s vp6 as the live codec not h 264 because the live encoders and fms 3 0 infrastructure to support the newer higher quality codec just isnt built out enough to guarantee its as reliable in the lead up to the games silverlight had the benefit of just building on top of an existing and fairly extensive wms infrastructure
6878878 n the marketing lead up to the olympics there seemed to be this message that nbc and its partners were bringing the olympics to the world

6878914 it is my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6878915 i saw that announcement we will continue to monitor the situation but we are not seeing that they are in compliance right now
6878916 there has been some movement of forces but whether or not that is an indication of a withdrawal or just a repositioning of forces is a bit difficult to determine at this point but those movements remain minor

6878922 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite u s presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement in addition to a timetable we should only train iraqi security forces if iraqs leaders reconcile their differences and we must insist that iraq invests its 79 billion surplus on rebuilding its own country its time to succeed in iraq and to honor the sacrifice of our servicemen and women by leaving iraq to a sovereign iraqi government

6878933 in the future i can tell maybe my athletes if i become a coach or maybe my children that i ran against the fastest man that ever lived and thats a pretty cool thing to say because hes a spectacle
6878934 hes probably the greatest athlete in the world he makes breaking world records look like its like tiger woods driving the ball 500 yards basically
6878935 its hard to pay attention to him hes so fast when he goes by you you think youd be able to track a guy thats nine feet tall
6878936 it would have been a lot better if wed actually got on the podium
6878937 yes this is the first time in 12 years but i would like to have a really good finish with that situation
6878938 were the best relay team since 1996 that canadas had and i dont necessarily think we showed that out there and its disappointing
6878939 its a lack of trust in our speed and its just being safe its like saying i could dive off the 10 metre but ill stick to the five just to be safe
6878940 we were too conservative its the olympic final we went out there with an air of caution we shouldnt have we should have went out there for broke we should have gone out there to break 38 seconds and instead we had the steps too short and we got ate up
6878941 when i came here who would have thought tabia charles would have made it to the finals
6878942 im very happy im sure i surprised a lot of people this just wasnt the day for me to pop up something tremendous but thats ok those things happen
6878943 i think that once i got broken in the race once you fall off and youre in land then you get more time to think and feel all the pain and nothing was there after that
6878944 i came here for experience and i learned a lot so its good on that side just how to compete with these guys and hold my energy during the times when youre down and you need to get back up
6878945 we dont have an expenditure problem we have a revenue problem
6878946 i cant be overdrawn i still have checks in the check book
6878947 our growth has helped us mask it all of these years this is about an erosion of financial support in the state of minnesota

6878949 if he wants to run for a third term i think its a great idea
6878950 mayor bloomberg if he wants to run for a third term i think its a great idea there was a time he wanted to run for president and that wouldnt have been a bad idea either because i cant think of another geographical location that has responded to the economic situation which people could feel coming two or three years ago better than new york city
6878951 wed love to have him around thats his decision to make by the way im running for a third term
6878952 there are multiple measures that come into play for the u s news and world report ratings the top tier designation is made possible based on what we provide our students small classes a low student faculty ratio and our graduation and retention rates
6878953 we provide an outstanding academic experience that is accessible and affordable our cost guarantee has served as a model for other universities in the united states
6878954 westerns commitment to academic excellence and educational opportunity two of its core values are our key focus
6878955 recognition from the u s news and world report the princeton review the pell institute and the center for student opportunity demonstrates that we are doing an exceptional job in providing academic excellence and educational opportunity
6878956 its a huge part of my life its tough to think beyond that but at some point im going to have to
6878957 i have some stuff going through my head but its going to stay there
6878958 its been an intense and hard couple of years and i think i need some time before i take the next step
6878959 its hard because i dont know whats going to come in my life when im going to start a family and all those things
6878960 obviously my husband and i are starting to think about the future and everything
6878961 probably since they were children theyve been known as the elite athlete and thats who they are at family barbecues
6878962 the goal will be to understand for themselves who they are now and celebrate the elite athlete part of their identity but also adding to it or shifting a little bit and more importantly communicating that to other people because networking accounts for probably 80 per cent of jobs people get
6878963 your coach tells you what to do when to wake up what you should be eating
6878964 its not easy but its easy in that you dont have to think for yourself very much and then youre out on your own you dont know how to apply your skills at all
6878965 i dove in a pool where i saw people go to the olympics and then become lifeguards and i thought that is not going to be me
6878966 i can tell you ive struggled with that transition quite a bit in the last couple of years
6878967 swimming has been such a huge part of my life i was pretty good at that i guess theres always the fear am i ever going to be that good at anything else again
6878968 i stayed in the sport longer than a lot of people so now at 35 to still be struggling and trying to figure out what you want to be when you grow up you feel like a bit of a flake
6878969 it makes it easy to learn some of the circus acrobatics because of your background in sports
6878970 most employers are going to look at these athletes and be fascinated with their careers and their whole interview might be about what was it like to be at the olympics so the person might not be given a chance to demonstrate theyre fit for that occupation
6878971 the key for the athlete is to use that employers language whatever field theyre going into
6878972 we believe these athletes come with a set of skills that nobody else has in terms of hard work and commitment
6878973 at the same time theyve had years having someone tell them what to eat when to get up and what their training schedule is some of their skills are very transferable and with others they need help
6878974 i dont know why i dont get more calls i should
6878975 everyone acknowledges retirement is really hard and nobody sort of does anything about it
6878976 we have nothing against the technology we just dont want that delivery system
6878977 they seem to think our community is their open job site
6878978 it is their contention they are not required to do so its our contention that they are
6878979 if we were going to have our landscape dotted with refrigerator size boxes we should have some control over them
6878980 we asked them to move certain locations and they voluntarily did

6878987 because google has 70 percent share of the search market on the pc
6878988 signing an ad revenue deal early would give verizon an advantage over its competitors
6878989 i think this is a competitive response by verizon to the google iphone deal which has shown the right partnerships can push cell phone adaptation by the consumer
6878990 its good from a verizon standpoint because it enhances the subscriber experience
6878991 right now there are a lot of things you need to do to find what you want using a mobile phone from a google perspective they think mobile is the next big area of growth
6878992 when you look at deals like clearwire or even new 3g and 4g services its easy to see why theyd be interested in getting a foothold in the mobile data market
6878993 if at some point verizon decides not to deal with google anymore there is no reason for google to have access to data related to verizons customers
6878994 i think its a good idea for google to insist that verizon be open to android
6878995 they want to make the user experience better for the customer but they also know that having an install base on its operating system much like

6878999 there is no longer any reason for employers to rely on resumes and yet the vast majority still do resumes are unstructured difficult to search amp compare expensive to handle and frustrating to store and retrieve the better approach to recruiting is to require all applicants external and internal to submit their applications using e profiles
6879000 how much money did i pay through job postings and other marketing means to attract candidates only to fail to get their applications
6879001 so how do i capture the resume in a fast and useful way
6879002 allow applicants to upload their standard resume and have it parsed into the appropriate fields of the profile inexpensive technology is available to do this
6879003 todays powerful searching and ranking technology can improve screening efficiency and accuracy tremendously for the greatest gains though structured data is required

6879021 many donors invested in the taylor fund because of their desire to sustain and strengthen taylors commitment to christ centered education

6879023 all of us at taylor university sincerely appreciate our partners who helped make this happen
6879024 this achievement became a reality thanks to their generosity and gods provision
6879025 even if a student paid every penny of tuition and got no financial aid or scholarship they would only pay around 80 of the actual cost of a taylor education that extra margin is covered in part by donations of friends parents and alumni to the taylor fund

6879054 in short crusade has grown into an evangelical powerhouse the point of first contact for many college students who moved away from the churches that reared them crusade was overdue for the new critical scholarly evaluation written by john g turner assistant professor of history at the university of south alabama his book bill bright and campus crusade for christ the renewal of evangelicalism in postwar america has already rankled some of the late brights family and colleagues indeed turner admits in the introduction that some crusade insiders who reviewed the manuscript in some cases vehemently disagreed with his conclusions but turners book succeeds precisely because he recorded the first hand observations of so many crusade insiders

6879058 remember the big mac museum that place was so weird
6879059 its a sweep in the sense of arresting people but it is also restoring trust and relationships that have been broken
6879060 for me this is a huge opportunity to potentially bridge the gap between being a professional player and having a proper job as a coach
6879061 the last few years i have found myself much more interested in coaching and during training i would analyse the coaching style and think a lot about what makes a good coach so i guess in that sense i have been interested in the coaching side of things
6879062 the biggest fear i had about the shift in my role was whether or not the players would listen to me but so far they seem to be keen to listen so that is great
6879063 coaching was never a life time ambition for me but certainly at the end of this season i will be looking more into which direction i go on
6879064 he understands the ambition of the club he understands where we want to take the club
6879065 we want to be a young vibrant team with energy and technical ability he comes into the category of the kind of young player we are trying to attract
6879066 the thing i like about him is his flexibility to play exceptionally well in a number of positions
6879067 that will help the team as the premier league is a long hard season and there will be injuries unfortunately
6879068 because of the suspicions weve got the action was taken to make sure nothing developed until the information we have is proven or disproven weve got no conclusive proof
6879069 any allegations with charges that lead us to investigate are taken very seriously
6879070 we will leave no stone unturned in determining whats taken place and well be very transparent

6879073 between july 14 and august 15 the price of comex silver declined from a peak high of 19 55 basis september to a low of 12 22 for a decline of 38 percent

6879075 as was the case with silver this is the largest short position ever by u s banks in the data listed on the cftcs internet site this was put on as one massive position just before the market collapsed in price

6879079 while the u s economy is still in turmoil its image in media coverage over the last months has been improving
6879080 because of this obamas lead on economic issues isnt the advantage it could have been in june or july
6879081 mccain has an edge on all the other major issues that we track
6879082 these include taxation foreign policy iraq and general leadership this also correlates with mccains positive movement in the polls which is generating positive media coverage for him as well
6879083 the democratic convention will put the focus strongly on obama and should benefit him in the media and the polls the question will be whether obama can take the momentum afterwards or if it will just be a temporary bump in his favor

6879091 go on give me one more condom because my girlfriends mum is still pretty cute and when she sees me she always makes eyes and since she invited me for dinner i think she is expecting me to make a move

6879109 weve heard how the value of the dollar affects gas prices and indeed the price of everything i was pleased that my request for a hearing on such was granted by the financial services committee and we were able to hear some very informative testimony certainly domestic policies regarding off shore oil drilling bans ethanol mandates refining capacity and cafe standards are interventionist and harmful enough in the energy market
6879110 but how does foreign policy affect gas prices one important factor is that oil on the world market has been priced in dollars exclusively since 1973 only two leaders have gone against this arrangement saddam hussein in 2000 and more recently mahmoud ahmadinejad with the recently opened iranian oil bourse which trades in non dollar currencies but since oil is otherwise exclusively traded in dollars this means that oil producers have vast amounts of assets held in dollars especially since the war on terror and the patriot act many oil producing nations and banks are concerned the us government may freeze assets based on flimsy pretexts this fear contributes to dollar weakness and therefore also high oil prices
6879111 for me this is a huge opportunity to potentially bridge the gap between being a professional player and having a proper job as a coach
6879112 the last few years i have found myself much more interested in coaching and during training i would analyse the coaching style and think a lot about what makes a good coach so i guess in that sense i have been interested in the coaching side of things
6879113 the biggest fear i had about the shift in my role was whether or not the players would listen to me but so far they seem to be keen to listen so that is great
6879114 coaching was never a life time ambition for me but certainly at the end of this season i will be looking more into which direction i go on
6879115 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6879116 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment

6879148 the big 3 detroit based automakers are seeking about 25 billion in federal loans as they struggle to ride out a steep downturn in u s auto sales the wall street journal reported on friday
6879149 lobbyists for the u s automakers general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler llc briefed white house officials as well as u s rep john dingell and other michigan democrats on a possible bailout and plan to unveil the proposal after labor day according to the report
6879150 the plan is for the government to lend some 25 billion to the automakers in the first year at an interest rate of 4 5 percent or about one third what the companies are currently paying to borrow the report said
6879151 under the proposal the government would have the option of deferring any payment at all for up to five years the article said
6879152 briefly these programs are intended to mitigate what have been at times very severe strains in short term funding markets and by providing an additional source of financing to allow banks and other financial institutions to deleverage in a more orderly manner we have recently extended our special programs for primary dealers beyond the end of the year based on our assessment that financial conditions remain unusual and exigent we will continue to review all of our liquidity facilities to determine if they are having their intended effects or require modification

6879155 err yes its shri here surgical sho i was wandering if you could help us we have a woman who needs some i v fluids but ive tried to site a cannula into her but i cant i was wandering if you were free to come and do this venflon for us one of your colleagues kindly came and did it for us earlier today
6879156 an anaesthetist came and put a venflon into her earlier
6879157 well thats not very responsible of you is it why didnt you secure the line properly and make sure it doesnt come out
6879158 well we tried earlier but none of us can do it
6879159 well i dont think its appropriate for you to call me to put in venflons in your patients
6879160 what one of my colleagues did as a favour is neither here nor there
6879161 look this is what you should do if you cant put a venflon in you need to call your registrar to come and do it if he cant do it then he needs to call the consultant to do it if the consultant doesnt want to do it then he needs to either get your reg to put in a central line or discuss with the icu consultant about putting in a central line on the cepod list if the icu consultant agrees to that then well come and put in a central line
6879162 then i suggest you either put a venflon in yourself or get one of your surgical colleagues to put one in you guys are doctors too arent you
6879163 im not coming to do it end of story either you sort it out yourselves or you go through the icu consultant putting in your venflons is not what im on call for goodbye

6879206 the supreme court has long held that government officials are allowed to open legislative gatherings with a prayer but that such prayers must in no way indicate a preference for one religion over others
6879207 individuals are free to express their own religious preferences but religious equality cannot exist when the government is allowed to use its considerable power to promote one particular faith

6879217 monday marks the beginning of the democratic national convention in denver a combination of factors makes this particular convention historic on many levels democrats have just completed an incredibly compelling primary cycle that has both energized and divided the democratic party because of the unique nature of the democratic primary we believe obama will receive a significant bump from his convention
6879218 this cycle mirrors bill clintons democratic convention in 1992 a historic 16 point bump
6879219 obamas stadium address on thursday the 45th anniversary of rev
6879220 we believe obama will see a significant bump and believe it is reasonable to expect nearly a 15 point bounce out of a convention in this political environment
6879221 obviously we are elated to continue accepting psychological patients we will continue to give them the quality care we always have
6879222 as a result of your satisfactory implementation of the corrective action plan
6879223 throughout this process the administration of fwbmc has demonstrated a positive commitment to doing what is necessary to ensure the provision of quality baker act services
6879224 there were some small deficiencies cited and there were some left uncorrected from the last time we were in the facility but none are at the jeopardy level
6879225 were willing to be accountable for what happens while the patients are under our care but its next to impossible to impact the care patients receive once they leave the hospital
6879226 our patients have other pre existing conditions that are a contributing factor they dont just die of pneumonia
6879227 were disappointed in the report that it really does not distinguish care provided in the hospital and care patients receive once they are discharged
6879228 we believe this is an isolated incident involving a very small number of stores over a specific period of time
6879229 cost plus is working with its bank and with the payment card companies to ensure that affected customers are identified in a timely manner
6879230 in the meantime we strongly recommend that customers who used payment cards for purchases at the identified stores during the specific period of time carefully review their account statements for any fraudulent activity
6879231 that i am able to add a coach with the experience and credentials of jeff ruland to my staff is exciting

6879235 more travelers concerned about the economy gasoline prices and rising airfares are opting to travel by train bus motorcycle and cruise ship to their holiday weekend destinations
6879236 this trend points to a desire on the part of the american public to seek alternatives to flying and driving to enjoy the traditional end of summer vacation
6879237 this is unfortunately a run of the mill child pornography case
6879238 were basically flying them three and four times our scheduled utilization rates
6879239 were the ones getting called on continuously to provide service to the country
6879240 were constantly on call constantly contributing to the fight across all the airframes
6879241 aircraft are aging theyre not dying theyre just aging and they need to be massaged along the way
6879242 vietnam vintage aircraft are still racing around like sports cars
6879243 we are averaging about 12 hours for every one hour flying in a brand new airplane it would be about four to eight
6879244 on one hand yeah its still a capable aircraft that is able to do a good service to the united states on the other hand due to its age and due to the increasing difficulty of procuring spare parts
6879245 its going to get to the point where it could become unserviceable in the future without a large amount of money and resources dedicated to it
6879246 there have been a few accidents nothing that can be directly pinned on age or the health of the fleet but can be more attributed to the hazardous nature of the environment that it operates in
6879247 i wouldnt fly them if i didnt have complete faith in the maintainers ability to make that aircraft mission ready to fly
6879248 and the ones that are down range its the same way
6879249 they wouldnt be sent into combat if it was considered an obsolete or incapable airframe
6879250 theres no other aircraft like it in the world we call the aircraft a tilt rotor because we can tilt the engines
6879251 the new aircraft the cv 22 brings a lot more to the fight
6879252 its not a helicopter its not an airplane it is something that melds the best aspects of both
6879253 the c 130 is one of the few aircraft that has as long a history as the pave low does
6879254 unlike the pave lows new are still being built to this day they may be shaped like the c 130 of many years ago but they have the guts of a new aircraft
6879255 the air force special operations command is growing rapidly investigating newer smaller lighter gunships to relieve the burden of our two current gunship squadrons
6879256 its all under way it takes some time and thats what this year and the next five years are about its about bridging the gap until we get those new airplanes online operationally capable and ready to go to war and share some of that burden
6879257 but there will have to be lots of consumer education before they will accept it
6879258 maybe the science community has not spoken enough about this
6879259 but they will be doing it more and more now
6879260 i hope we will see a reduction in the number of food borne illnesses
6879261 it gives the industry another tool to increase food safety
6879262 there is no reason to suspect a toxicological hazard due to consumption of an irradiated food
6879263 with all the scares that there have been involving spinach this is a good step forward
6879264 why arent they looking at the source of what causes these problems
6879265 the growers and shippers of spinach and iceberg lettuce will conduct assessments to see how effectively this can be accomplished with produce and what investment will be needed
6879266 i think there is a long way to go before irradiation is implemented
6879267 in a way its like erasing your mistakes and saying something is safe that is not produced in a safe manner
6879268 the treatment of food with ionizing radiation can produce a variety of beneficial effects
6879269 however it should be clear that irradiation is not a remedy for unsatisfactory production practices
6879270 it is unlikely that irradiation will have significant nutritional impact on a balanced diet of raw canned and ready to eat fruits and vegetables
6879271 we dont have much concern about the safety of irradiated foods
6879272 as much fun as this is id much rather be behind the camera
6879273 everything i learned about documentary film i learned in the wrigley building
6879274 end of life issues are prominent in the population here
6879275 that might have precluded the kind of care that normal heart failure patients might undergo
6879276 ok this stuff cant just go away so isnt it still on your hands
6879277 war on bacteria is wrongheaded by christopher wanjek for live science pity the poor bacterium the rodney dangerfield of the unicellular world it eats our trash makes soil fertile turns the food we swallow into useful vitamins and yet it gets no respect most people when you get right down to it are just plain bacteria bigots they want to run all 2 000 plus species of bacteria out of town just because of a few ornery germs that can harm us and now it seems our pursuit of a bacteria free world is making us sick got antibacterial soap it could be doing you more harm than good a study published this month in chest trust me its a medical journal finds that antibiotic exposure during infancy is associated with asthma this follows a string of studies from the past few years such as those from the immune tolerance network revealing that early exposure to harmful bacteria builds a healthy immune system kids exposed to endotoxin releasing bacteria for example are less likely to be allergic to dogs and cats these docs have a sense of humor too they call this the pigpen effect after the peanuts character with his protective cloud of dirt its a dirty little secret the antibacterial soap people dont want you to know about the rising incidence of asthma and allergies in the developed cleaner world doctors say could be tied to the relatively sterile environments our children live in compared to a generation ago children not exposed to harmful bacteria or conversely given antibiotics to kill bacteria do not receive the germ workout required to make antibodies more specifically they do not develop t helper cells which fight foreign cellular invaders and minimize allergies unfortunately the american consumer is at war with all bacteria according to the soap and detergent association too bad its acronym couldnt spell sud more than three quarters of liquid soap and more than a quarter of bar soaps on supermarket shelves contain triclosan an antibiotic that kills most bacteria both good and bad ridding ourselves of bacteria is a hopeless endeavor bacteria outnumber human cells in your body 10 to 1 this is a good thing the entire digestive tract is lined with bacteria from top to uh bottom these bacteria work with the bodys own chemicals in breaking down food converting it to useful vitamins and minerals and making sure the intestinal walls can absorb the nutrients for the bloodstream to circulate without these bacteria we could not digest food babies born relatively bacteria free are extremely limited in what they can eat human skin contains many species of harmless bacteria their presence prevents harmful bacteria what we commonly call germs from gaining a foothold on your skin numerous studies show that antibacterial soap is no more effective than ordinary soap in cleaning your hands either kind lifts off germ laden dirt but antibacterial soap kills helpful bacteria on the skin freeing up valuable real estate so that harmful bacteria can move in later the marketing of antibacterial products during flu and cold season is a scam because colds and flu are caused by viruses not bacteria most bacterial infections in the united states are food borne salmonella listeria and e coli we cannot wash food in triclosan apparently we tolerate feces in our food supply yet reach for an antibacterial wipe to clean some jelly off the counter its enough to make you sick
6879278 it may be prudent to avoid the use of antimicrobial agents in consumer products
6879279 de belasting betaler zal mogen betalen voor bellens maar we hebben nog tot 28 augustus als ik het goed heb dus duimen maar dat het niet zo word belgaocm is en blijft een staats monopolist als de regering moet beslissen of de ceo aan mag blijven of dient ontslagen te worden
6879280 this one she just got out and it was just really unfortunate we just have our fingers crossed that its still alive and hopefully found somewhere warm and some food source we dont know what itll find at this time of year
6879281 its not like trying to find a horse or trying to find a sheep or something like that theyre up trees or inside bushes theyre just so mobile
6879282 more information has come to light that did point to discrepancies
6879283 we have asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further with the national chinese federation if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into as to why there is a discrepancy
6879284 these documents existed on a state wide website and now they dont exist and this change has taken place recently
6879285 much of the coverage regarding kexins age has only mentioned allegations of fraud and the ioc has ignored the matter completely i believe that these primary documents issued by the chinese state rise to a level of evidence higher than allegation how official are these documents pretty dang official they were issued by the general administration of sport of china
6879286 i want to know what happened whos responsible who will be held accountable and what the human services secretary will do about it
6879287 if people cooked the books manipulated the methodology or told the contractor to ignore the rules those individuals need to take the heat
6879288 weve been trying to get at these fraudulent claims for a long time
6879289 while we agree with the inspector general that the medical equipment error rate we reported should have been higher allegations of manipulation of this error rate are preposterous
6879290 in addition the 3 billion figure for improper medical equipment payments is an unsupported extrapolation at this time because the report only cited percentages
6879291 everyone is royally upset at the way that medicare is trying to scam congress by telling us theyre fighting fraud when theyre telling their auditors to ignore government policies on audits to make themselves look better
6879292 we have far exceeded our expectations having reduced the error rate beyond the 2006 goal of 5 1 percent
6879293 the police were on airboats the catfish are crossing the roads

6879308 the council could act on its own accord within the next six to eight months or call a special election to determine whether to change term limits this could prompt a possible backlash campaign to reverse the wishes of the council or the voters who supported it in a low turnout election it is then conceivable that current office holders could run for re election to a third term at the same time voters are deciding whether to keep to the two term limit rule consequently certain office holders are technically re elected but cant serve because voters approved keeping the two term limit in place this could possibly result in a number of vacancies in the citys elected offices on january 1 2010 however the effective dates of the proposals could potentially help to mitigate a situation in which candidates ran under different assumptions regarding the number of terms they could serve

6879310 bush daddy has kept pestering me about the issue of living dismemberment probably thinking that this is what it means when psalm 53 5 says that god will scatter the bones of those camping against you bush daddy says this means that the limbs of the designated target will be duct taped and cut off each time the person revives another limb will be cut off and or shortened until he or she succumbs

6879376 barack obama is more similarly situated to bill clinton in 1992 than any other candidate in recent history
6879377 bill clinton was a new candidate on the national scene he was running in a change oriented election cycle and the economy was voters top issue a dynamic he was able to capitalize on
6879378 obama will correct his underperformance with hillary clintons primary votes and emerge with a much more cohesive base
6879379 this convention gives obama a platform to unite his base
6879380 this coverage will be impenetrable and will undoubtedly impact the polls
6879381 we are looking at all options and hope to meet with the company in the very near future to discuss our thoughts
6879382 with them continuing to buy after the word was out youve got to think theyre expecting more to come

6879385 it was pride prides not good to a certain extent but these are the olympic games and ive trained long and hard for this im happy to be here today happy to be with my family
6879386 i think i would have made a statement with the judges here by refusing to fight again but in hindsight i believe the people back home deserved a bronze medal if anything not winning anything would have been worse
6879387 theres bad calls all the time and this is one of the times it happened to me
6879388 this has been going on for 20 or 30 years and every time it happens were told to be quiet and it will get better
6879389 it gets better every four years for about 10 seconds and then it happens again and when it happens to you youre told to shut up and not say anything because of what might happen to the sport
6879390 if this is truly what taekwondo is about maybe taekwondo shouldnt be an olympic sport maybe they should fix it and then let it come back
6879391 there is a concern that we will not survive as an olympic sport and that we must present a pristine environment of terrific scoring
6879392 we were manhandled we were threatened we participated in good faith we would expect the organization to provide us a level playing field and we dont think we were given a level playing field
6879393 they have the right to protest but in a peaceful manner
6879394 most of our energy and time was devoted to ensure fair judging especially in the olympic games
6879395 so far we think it is the fairest judges and refereeing our judges are doing their best
6879396 it showed human error whether it was intentional or not ill never know
6879397 but what i do know is that i showed the world that its about competition its about the human spirit and going out there and being the best you can be that is why i went out there and fought
6879398 the only thing that we can figure is that three of the referees sneezed at the same time or that they pushed their buttons to register a point on instinct
6879399 theyre nearsighted and shallow in seeing things as gold silver and bronze and instead of the hard work the dedication the sacrifice the miracle of what just transpired
6879400 sometimes we miss the little miracles and those of the big miracles of life
6879401 we now have reason to believe that the logic error in the gems code can cause this event when no such antivirus program is installed on the server
6879402 it is the dedication of board officials such as those at the butler county board of elections who went above and beyond the call of duty that gives me confidence that preparation with our local partners will lead to a successful november election
6879403 now that what appears to be the root cause for this voting tabulation error has been identified we will prepare ohios counties using the premier voting system software with instructions for following strict protocols needed to identify and correct this error if it occurs
6879404 we will continue to monitor the situation and provide boards of elections with the instruction and support they need to ensure an orderly and efficient election and an accurate count of ohioans votes
6879405 this is a significant issue and they have to work to address it

6879481 despite the global downturn flattening the growth of personal debt and uk gdp over the past few quarters debt levels continue to grow at a faster rate than the income the uk generates although there is no cause for panic as personal debt is well covered by the uk housing stock the figures clearly illustrate the continuing problem of growing personal debt levels in the uk if the property market and economy continue to weaken the current levels of personal debt will become unsustainable and there will be a marked increase in personal insolvencies

6879539 thats why its important that kevin rudd doesnt sit around for too long on the recommendations contained in the bracks report
6879540 we know that the industry is facing these acute challenges and i cant say with any certainty that there wont be further announcements in regard to job losses

6879559 i am pleased to report another quarter during which we have grown revenues improved margins and strengthened our balance sheet the important steps we have taken over the past year to improve operational efficiency and develop market leading products are beginning to show genuine improvements to our bottom line and this gives me confidence that we are better positioned than ever for future growth
6879560 although we managed to improve margins during the first half of the year we still face a number of potential challenges in the second half in particular wafer costs and wafer quality
6879561 despite these challenges i am confident that our improving supply pipeline declining wafer costs and higher conversion efficiencies will strengthen our gross margin from the end of this year and into 2009
6879562 we are now in a far more stable financial position and are better placed to secure long term supply agreements to expand production and to fund r amp d enhancement in a cost effective manner our contract with rec will help us to reduce overall wafer costs from 2009 we remain cautious about the overall market outlook for wafer prices in the second half of this year however the expected increase in high efficiency cell production will enable us to at least partially offset any increase in wafer cost

6879631 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6879632 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6879633 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6879634 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6879635 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6879636 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6879637 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6879638 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6879639 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6879640 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6879641 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6879642 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6879643 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6879644 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6879645 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6879646 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6879647 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6879648 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6879649 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6879650 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6879651 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6879652 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6879653 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6879654 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6879655 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6879656 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6879657 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6879658 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6879659 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people

6879675 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6879676 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen

6879683 charlie brown really opposes offshore drilling and cant muster the courage to tell the voters of the fourth district his true position

6879685 brown is raising money from the very people who are blocking this nations ability to become energy independent

6879695 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6879696 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6879697 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6879698 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6879699 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6879700 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6879701 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6879702 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6879703 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6879704 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6879705 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6879706 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6879707 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6879708 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6879709 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday

6879719 people got used to hearing something cool on a commercial and being like what band is this
6879720 if theyre out there really doing it if theyre playing at the echo then theyre not just being informed by how do i make this for a commercial theyre informed by their whole experience therefore you deliver something authentic
6879721 ive compared every other guy that ive met to you and they dont measure up
6879722 its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
6879723 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
6879724 to be very careful and sensitive these days the russians are selling many arms to iran and syria and there is no need to offer them an excuse to sell even more advanced weapons
6879725 both war and peace are in the hands of israeli jews
6879726 gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him
6879727 we have turned down many requests involving arms sales to georgia and the ones that have been approved have been duly scrutinized
6879728 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6879729 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6879730 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6879731 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6879732 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6879733 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6879734 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6879735 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6879736 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6879737 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6879738 theres no question in my mind that this president and this administration would never have invaded iraq especially on the flimsy evidence that was presented to the congress if indeed we had a draft and members of congress and the administration thought that their kids from their communities would be placed in harms way

6879742 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6879743 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6879744 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6879745 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6879746 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6879747 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6879748 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6879749 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6879750 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6879751 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6879752 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6879753 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6879754 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6879755 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6879756 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6879757 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6879758 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6879759 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6879760 what may be most impressive about the experiment is the ease with which the students accomplished it although the genetic testing technique is at the forefront of research the fact that anyone can take advantage of it by sending samples off to a laboratory meant the kind of investigative tools once restricted to ph d s and crime labs can move into the hands of curious diners and amateur scientists everywhere
6879761 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6879762 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6879763 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6879764 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6879765 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6879766 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6879767 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6879768 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6879769 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6879770 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6879771 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6879772 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6879773 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6879774 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6879775 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6879776 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6879777 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6879778 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6879779 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6879780 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6879781 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6879782 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6879783 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6879784 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6879785 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6879786 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6879787 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6879788 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6879789 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6879790 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6879791 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6879792 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6879793 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6879794 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6879795 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6879796 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6879797 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6879798 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6879799 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6879800 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6879801 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6879802 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6879803 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6879804 dolphin free tuna what if i want to eat my dolphin tuna free what makes dolphins have more of a right to live than tuna
6879805 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6879806 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6879807 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6879808 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6879809 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6879810 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6879811 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6879812 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6879813 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6879814 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6879815 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6879816 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6879817 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6879818 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6879819 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6879820 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6879821 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6879822 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6879823 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6879824 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6879825 the best hosting service ive ever worked with bar none
6879826 the display of flags and the placing or storing of any items within a hallway exit access exit or stairwell of the house office buildings
6879827 the best hosting service ive ever worked with bar none
6879828 movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead
6879829 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6879830 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6879831 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6879832 well send you six of our best selling cigars of the month for free all you have to pay is the s h
6879833 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6879834 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6879835 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6879836 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6879837 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6879838 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6879839 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6879840 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6879841 les nouvelles sur lehman sont rassurantes en ce quelles laissent penser quil y a encore de la valeur dans certains tablissements financiers
6879842 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6879843 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6879844 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6879845 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6879846 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6879847 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6879848 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6879849 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6879850 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6879851 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6879852 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6879853 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6879854 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6879855 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6879856 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6879857 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6879858 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6879859 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6879860 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6879861 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6879862 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
6879863 even cartoon characters had to behave betty boop stopped being a flapper and started wearing a longer skirt

6879874 we do not recognize a country called israel and so we cannot recognize a nation called israel
6879875 though the resolution was supposedly aimed only at secular zionism the slander is an attack on the entire jewish people
6879876 we agudath israel adherents would feel precisely the same responsibility to come to the defense of our brethren while we may have our own quarrel with secular zionism when jews are libeled their affiliation does not matter our love for our brothers and sisters draws us to their side
6879877 the u n resolution is aimed at all jews for it assails the historical jewish right to eretz yisrael the torah bestowed that right and any attack on it is an attack on judaism and the jewish people

6879902 the resignation of secretary rumsfeld is welcome and could represent a significant shift in direction by this administration i hope it opens the door to fresh ideas on iraq

6879904 this summer while running routes mike tweaked his knee and partially tore his left acl
6879905 his two options were to have the knee fixed immediately or to brace it and try to play he understrood that eventually the knee would have to be fixed and he was hoping to do it at the conclusion of the 2008 season
6879906 mike had continued to practice but felt his progress had deteriorated thursday afternoon mike came to me and decided that having the surgery done now prior to the start of school would be best the surgery was successful and mike will spend the 2008 season rehabbing to be ready for the 2009 season
6879907 almost every democratic polling memo that comes across my desk argues that voters want change or are dissatisfied with the direction of the country and they are right but only so far the problem for democrats is that in most cases that wont be enough by itself to get voters to fire gop incumbents thats particularly true if republicans pound away at their challengers making them the issue in their races and decreasing their appeal as vehicles for change of course not all republican incumbents are doing that yet and thats a mistake that some republicans could well come to regret
6879908 you know education if you make the most of it you study hard you do your homework and you make an effort to be smart you can do well and if you dont you get stuck in iraq
6879909 the time has come to look at this patchwork of election laws across the country and set national standards
6879910 it has created a really unstable voting system across america
6879911 a good deal overall in simplifying the mobile search market
6879912 as phones open up users will be able to use whichever search engine they desire not the ones deemed official by the carriers
6879913 not a war to be won but a situation to be solved
6879914 this basically freezes the status quo going forward and is buying the governor and the various stake holders some time to address the issue
6879915 a huge increase in medical practice rates would be harmful to doctors hospitals and to the millions of new yorkers who depend on them for health care
6879916 new yorks medical malpractice insurance rates are among the highest rates in the nation
6879917 this legislation allows us to continue and indeed broaden our discussions towards enhancing patient safety while stabilizing the medical malpractice insurance market
6879918 i ran out of my car and saw a car crushed on the side wall with the engine still running and smoke coming out of the engine i looked in and saw people were in there
6879919 i decided all along that if i came across the scene of a car accident i would always stop
6879920 my legs were a little shaky but i took a deep breath and settled down and just kind of went back to the more medical aspect of assessing patients and figuring out what to do from there
6879921 i was dumbfounded by how calm he was and how settled he was and how he just had a lets do this in a very organized way it calmed me
6879922 i felt that i was doing what i needed to do and just do what you gotta do

6879933 charles osgood the cbs radio correspondent offered a mea culpa in his daily broadcast tuesday
6879934 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
6879935 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
6879936 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
6879937 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
6879938 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws
6879939 for candidates of either party to become the nominee when there is any question of the ability to serve if elected
