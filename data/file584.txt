5840029 we need academic freedom and an ability to talk about these things without fearing legal consequences
5840030 the marketplace of ideas does not work when we have gag orders imposed on our scientists
5840031 now that the court proceedings are behind us i renew my invitation to the students to sit down with us and discuss their findings
5840032 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5840033 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5840034 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country

5840058 many had expressed concerns that hps results were going to start to be affected by the economy but hp had solid numbers
5840059 the only other company that has a similar ability to stand out is ibm but thats a very different story a story of transitioning to a more service oriented approach
5840060 desperate group of people trying to make something out of nothing
5840061 this new sec resource powered by interactive data will give investors far faster more accurate and more meaningful information about the companies and mutual funds they own

5840063 dynamic system they can use to get the information they need rather than having to wade through an avalanche of paper forms legalese and doublespeak
5840064 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
5840065 i think new west is unique in that we are a small city right in the middle of the lower mainland so often a lot of the individuals that we may be dealing with can come from other communities in a day and age when police are expected to do more with less its an innovative way to deal with individuals that are prehaps causing a drain on these budgets and police resources
5840066 if we win the grey cup ill probably have 1 000 1 000
5840067 thats what matters to me winning every game if we win every game and i get that then so be it if we win grey cup and i dont get it then again so be it
5840068 the fact is he can protect he can make good plays with his legs and then he can come out of the backfield and make some awesome plays with his hands
5840069 hes an all around back that takes our offence to another level
5840070 hes a terrific player and a big part of what we do
5840071 theres a trust factor between avon and the guys blocking for him
5840072 they work very hard together theyre a co ordinated group in terms of their sense for each other
5840073 but i want it the football any way i can get it
5840074 its tough its really tough because we have so many different routes that he runs and they dont know what hes going to do

5840076 the bye comes at a great time because we need the rest
5840077 if youre not banged as a football player then youre not working hard and i feel we are working hard and need the rest right now
5840078 there is no ps3 version of left 4 dead currently in production
5840079 who would you get thats better its almost like recasting homer simpson or something
5840080 i mean with chucky theres an aspect of him that feels like hes an animated character so his voice is such an immense part of it as well as what he looks like
5840081 if you could recast it you would want the actor to sound kind of like it but it would feel weird to just be completely different i think
5840082 its a reboot of the chucky origin story i guess we can describe it that way
5840083 i think what we are mainly responding to david and i is the will of the fans which is really telling us that they want to see a scary chucky movie again they want to go back to the straightforward horror rather than the horror comedy
5840084 i mean part of that is business in the sense that that is a trend that is sort of galloping over hollywood right now but i feel like thats a trend we can use to our advantage because it really does dovetail nicely with our main mission which is to make it really scary its been four years since the last one so it just seems like the timing is really good now for us to just recreate it in a way
5840085 i think don has really created some really clever twists and expectations that a fan of the first childs play film you will be surprised and shocked by but it will follow i think very closely a lot of the first film against twists and turns that don has put into it that an audience thinks it is going to go one way and we will go another even though the story is pretty similar
5840086 college student experience of mental health service use and psychiatric medication
5840087 university mental health providers have observed increased numbers of students visiting college mental health centers

5840089 im just so grateful that i have been given an amazing talent and im just so happy that im able to come and perform i dont know where i am right now you never think its a reality its something you dream about as i came across the line i thought oh my gosh im just so proud of myself
5840090 today i warmed up for an hour and a half i had to keep stopping and sitting down to sort my head out i felt tired i hadnt slept for the last two nights the pressure was getting to me i thought if i dont win what will happen as it gets closer and closer you get more scared and realise it is a lot harder than you think it is
5840091 my coach always says that you train for three days and three days only you dont train for grand prix races you dont train for the trials you train for these three days if youre at your best for those three days thats what its about
5840092 i had a bad start but i just ran my own race i could just see the russian chasing sanya down so i kept running after her if youre going to beat me then you have to fight very hard
5840093 lloyd always said that the race would be won in the last 50m it doesnt so much matter what you do before you need to keep your cool and keep your composure for the last 50m and stay relaxed
5840094 thats when people start dying and everyone knows that i dont die in the last 50m thats how i run and it obviously works
5840095 despite the long and demanding effort it was actually fun
5840096 our clients were incensed by the level of illegal downloading in the first 14 days since topware interactive released dream pinball 3d it sold 800 legitimate copies but was illegally downloaded 12 000 times hopefully people will think twice if they risk being taken to court

5840105 disappointment that our bishops conference recently could not agree a collegial response to the governments legislation on same sex adoption
5840106 attempting to arrive at a consensus among bishops with sometimes divergent views episcopal conference statements and documents have a tendency to be often flat and safe at a time when we need passionate and courageous public statements that dare to speak the full truth in love
5840107 i must admit that during my 15 years as a bishop i have increasingly come to share certain concerns about the relationship between individual bishops and the national conference
5840108 reluctance among the rest of the bishops to speak out on these issues
5840109 results often in the loss of the scandal and the folly of the gospel so that we are no longer the salt and leaven so urgently needed
5840110 confident courageous and prophetic bishops are vital for the well being of the church during this time of increasingly aggressive secularism
5840111 the passion to serve the lord is noticeably absent in many cases there seems to be at times a tiredness and reticence to preach the gospel
5840112 doctrinal and moral teaching in their collaboration with secular agencies
5840113 im thinking in particular of agencies with a responsibility for education or economic development the staff of these agencies are often in a position to witness to the truth of the churchs teaching on say the theology of the body with its positive refutation of pre marital sex safe sex or artificial birth control in their dealings with government departments and committees
5840114 there must be no back peddling on these issues just because certain truths are unwelcome in the corridors of power
5840115 we have talked too much and done too little we have witnessed over the past forty years a growing crisis in the catholic understanding or self identity of the church have we forgotten what it is to be catholic
5840116 the maturity of the pope john paul ii generation will lead i hope to a resurgence of orthodox committed adults in the church gradually renewing vocations to the priesthood religious life and marriage
5840117 what hes saying is what weve all been saying for years but now its a bishop saying it we can use it and quote it and build on it so yes its a very good thing
5840118 women 40 to 44 years old will end their childbearing years with an average of 1 9 children each a number below replacement level fertility
5840119 it means that 25 years from now therell be many elderly people who are childless and who may not have anybody to care for them
5840120 who are often the first to experience the consequences of this eclipse of love and hope
5840121 often instead of feeling loved and cherished they appear to be merely tolerated
5840122 necesitan estar preparados para lidiar con familias que est n aguardando un milagro

5840125 the park doesnt have a history of this kind of violent crimes said ray brown acting park superintendent
5840126 ive been here 17 years nearly and i dont recall a crime of this nature
5840127 i probably will keep my eyes open a little more than normal
5840128 theres been enough misery on this ground to not have that
5840129 its an opportunity for them to show that they know how to do it
5840130 in this regard a bad choice hurts much more than a good choice helps
5840131 i think a week from tomorrow we will all know
5840132 we feel these moves benefit all the industry including the tracks and the teams and most importantly our fans
5840133 fans have been clamoring for a sprint cup series race under the lights at atlanta motor speedway
5840134 its thrilling to bring labor day racing back to the south this will be a great opportunity for atlanta motor speedway to celebrate our 50th year of racing
5840135 nascars selection of iowa speedway as a site for a nationwide race next year in only our third full year of competitive racing is an honor and a privilege
5840136 were very excited about the nascar craftsman truck series coming to chicagoland speedway
5840137 its a great strong addition to our schedule that already includes sprint cup nationwide and the irl
5840138 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5840139 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that
5840140 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5840141 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5840142 was unable to provide assurances that shed be able to protect the child in the future
5840143 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5840144 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5840145 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5840146 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work

5840150 hes just moved into the billy graham role the d l moody or our generation
5840151 he rick warren asked the questions that the evangelical community wanted to hear
5840152 most of us who follow the campaigns knew what the answers would be we didnt know what the questions would be
5840153 the idea that guys didnt have the time to prepare nothing honest ideas on crucial issues of life as far as the christian community
5840154 didnt get to be clever and had to be honest
5840155 debates mar the issues of truth debates expose good debaters but not the issues

5840157 the objectives were to provide product trial among a key physician group to accelerate uptake of vioxx as the second entrant in a highly competitive new class
5840158 i dont think people would be willing to risk side effects if they knew that the aim of a clinical trial was to boost profits for a pharmaceutical company
5840159 i would think that at some level this is standard practice

5840167 you guys have better things to do im not the guy
5840168 we will hopefully be announcing our new singer soon i cant give you a name or hints yet but we have not been so happy in a long time he is a sick ass singer as well as a person we are going into audiohammer studios in sanford florida in september to record some new shit and as soon as we have it so will you
5840169 our new stuff is more brutal still fun to listen to like the first album but more of a children of bodom meets pantera s vulgar display of power wierd mix i know but we want to incorporate every band members personality into the music so were trying to find a singer that will bring his own thing and make us a band that kids want to watch live not boring like the other 98 of bands that are touring currently
5840170 november we cross the big pond and tour the uk well also be releasing a split titled
5840171 december and onward we lose our drummer yep after almost 7 years
5840172 bigger and better its just amazing im so proud of our scripts and we are all working really hard
5840173 you know i thought it was going to be that way but as soon as i went back it was like we had never left
5840174 lets just say i would need a pretty good plastic surgeon in real life but since im a terminator things heal up pretty good
5840175 we watched inspectors test only one front hoof instead of both when they got a backlog what good does it do to test one hoof
5840176 it is unreasonable to expect that another expert witness could step in at this juncture
5840177 nothing about us needing to explain to someone why where to and for how long the black sea fleet ships are leaving their walls
5840178 without a doubt there wont be any mine fences or military collisions one shouldnt even talk about that

5840185 where it was hard for them to do 25 jumping jacks in the beginning now they are knocking out a few sets of them and some other calisthenics and they are looking forward to it
5840186 they tell us that they are up at two and three in the morning eating pizza its unfortunate but kids will be kids
5840187 i dont like eating breakfast but then they told me that that will help you maintain your weight and lose weight by eating breakfast so ive been working hard to do that
5840188 it feels better i feel more energetic i dont feel as hungry as i used to around 12 oclock so it really does help
5840189 is this program going to solve the problem i dont think any one program is going to solve the problem
5840190 i think we need coordinated efforts between programs for children environmental change policy change outreach to parents and all of those things together will hopefully reverse the trend
5840191 we just hope that as these protesters get arrested as we think some of them will that their rights are fully protected and make sure that the city is staffed with as many well trained attorneys as possible so we can make sure everyones constitutional rights are safe
5840192 a lot of people arent happy with the direction the country is going and this is a chance to be there when people are trying to make a change
5840193 and when you look over history and think this could be one of those moments and to be there to help people however you can help them so they can do that
5840194 this is what a lot of people have gone to law school for and were talking about some of the most fundamental rights the freedom of speech is what the country was founded on and this is a chance to be part of that
5840195 in the last 30 years this work was done by just a few lawyers and we had bigger than an average crowd
5840196 and these are people from all walks of representation so something is inspiring people to get involved and i hope its social change
5840197 to improve understanding of the size and distribution of geothermal energy resources and to update geothermal mapping of north america
5840198 its not tv its hbo shows like entourage and curb your enthusiasm light up the year with new seasons and it
5840199 its the most exciting thing on the horizon its the thing that when i wake up in the morning it makes me say god it would be cool if that happened
5840200 this is my grand ambition will it happen i dont know it was fun sitting and telling the hbo guys and watching them shake their head and having writers on board and producers that are in to it its been a fun thing
5840201 i just pitched it to hbo two weeks ago in l a it went
5840202 was unable to provide assurances that shed be able to protect the child in the future

5840205 we detected a missile launch from iran on august 16 and our reports indicated it was unsuccessful
5840206 it certainly didnt get very far off the ground and it definitely did not meet the overall objectives that the iranians reported the test achieved

5840228 hoppla nach 8 jahren nun doch auseinandergelebt zu verschiedene interessen
5840229 h ja klar naja kopf hoch nach regen kommt wieder sonnenschein
5840230 ja gut hier fahr doch weg hast du denn keinen urlaub mehr
5840231 haben sich nach der rtlii sache nicht mehr bei mir gemeldet

5840233 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great
5840234 i so wish i had listened to my mom and grandma when i was 18 and would complain about some little tiny bump or feeling bloated
5840235 i used to scoff and say no i feel fat today now the jokes on me
5840236 i want to tell all young girls to walk around in bikinis all summer because there will be that one day in your twenties when youll eat a hamburger and actually see the hamburger on the side of your leg

5840238 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5840239 heartfelt thanks for the sacrifice that they are making and the commitment that the french are making to help secure afghanistan
5840240 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves
5840241 its great news for the free speech rights for these students
5840242 although its extremely unfortunate that the students were not allowed to give their talk at defcon
5840243 it was definitely unfair to use that statute to silence the students
5840244 we certainly hope the next time that people are allowed to present their important research instead of being silenced by bogus lawsuits
5840245 were glad the court actually saw things as they should be
5840246 all the material we were going to talk about has been made public and more
5840247 despite whats happened and the animosity the mbta has brought toward us
5840248 i cant really comment on the actual means that we used
5840249 its probably not a good idea to comment on that we certainly did not get free fare we had to spend several hundred dollars on buying tickets to look at the data structure far more than we ever would have used
5840250 last year no one gave enough credit as a rider to casey except maybe nicky plus hes used to having a stronger teammate
5840251 in the beginning at honda he was with valentino rossi and then with dani pedrosa and he has a lot of things that make us think he would be the best teammate for casey
5840252 and we dont have to worry about his consistency and i think he is a good complimentary teammate for casey on the other hand you can always have a young rider and if hes a rookie he has no pressure to do anything
5840253 we hope to confirm everything for ducatis 2009 plans by the end of this month if not then at indianapolis
5840254 committed to resolving the issues raised in connection with the investigation
5840255 it took a long time for the surge in commodity prices to seep into the general economy so dont expect one month of commodity price declines to suddenly turn off the inflation pump
5840256 a firmer dollar retreating commodity prices and continued economic weakness should damp inflation by the fall
5840257 reflect the recent significant fall in oil prices which everyone would like to see continue

5840259 re volt is going to be our high impact earth shattering fps for the iphone this game is definitely geared towards the more experienced player thats not to say beginners wont love this game too the beauty of the iphone is the simplistic and just plain fun controls that make a game like re volt a real form of entertainment for a broader audience because it is an fps i think it will initially strike a chord with the hard core gamers but i think word will spread and its popularity will be wide spread
5840260 social networking sites such as facebook are a fast growing phenomenon mr hulls said in a statement
5840261 social network users need to realise that the information and photos they put into cyberspace in some cases can be seen by others and can leave a digital tattoo that can be difficult to erase
5840262 the latest research from the us suggests 44 per cent of employers are now using sites like myspace and facebook to research job candidates

5840271 you will definitely see a lot of jamaicans at the game but hopefully there are way canadians
5840272 that is a good group of fans behind the south end net probably one of the best groups in the league
5840273 when i have come here with houston and at the all star game they have phenomenal and it is good to see that the fans are supporting soccer here in toronto
5840274 i am not trying to think about if we dont qualify but rather when we do
5840275 putting my general managers hat back on considering where the network is right now it is actually the right call

5840280 thats one time so i think they are being suitably cautious given the macro pressures
5840281 theres broadly two choices either make them a part of the federal financial safety net or distinctly private for my money id prefer to see them credibly and demonstrably privatized
5840282 despite what u s treasury secretary hank paulson said these giant mortgage guarantee agencies are not going to exist in their present form in a few years
5840283 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5840284 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves

5840292 every device we make is a microprocessor controlled device capable as serving as a node on a network
5840293 our devices generate information about how they are used and many of our new devices can be remotely activated by a local user or a user over a network to truly take advantage of these capabilities the software infrastructure becomes the glue that ties the hardware together think of the ipod itunes ecosystem that apple has developed

5840300 part of mccains long running rebellion against the stupidity of modern partisanship in a thousand ways he has tried to preserve some sense of self respect in a sea of pandering pomposity
5840301 mccain and his advisors have been compelled to adjust to the hostile environment around them now they are running a much more conventional race the kind mccain himself used to ridicule
5840302 mccains campaign has become more conventional his political prospects have soared
5840303 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5840304 the slapdash release of morrissey live at the hollywood bowl is done by warner without any consultation to me whatsoever and is in breach of their terms as laid out by themselves in an agreement made for the film between warner and my ex manager
5840305 arent there some crimes that are so horrific that there is nothing the defendant can do to mitigate it
5840306 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5840307 obtain an assault weapon legally preferably ak 47 or variations
5840308 regular purchases of weapons and ammunition from flea markets and gun shows
5840309 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5840310 i would definitely say that she to her credit is somebody who doesnt leak and i think that there is probably a good shared mindset with the obama team on that front
5840311 im almost sure she is still in the running and i think it is to the credit of the chicago team because their mores arent guided by beltway chatter
5840312 her strength is mostly symbolic as a blue governor in a red state
5840313 a lot of it is her personal relationship with obama and i think if obama was ahead by ten points right now he might choose kathleen but in a two point race i dont see how you give up a major political card like a more dynamic pick to play
5840314 a lot of it is pretty sophisticated good reporters look at this and say i know she has been named but honestly what does she bring to the ticket
5840315 and once they look they dont find that much politically in terms of her helping obama she doesnt have the foreign policy or military expertise and she doesnt come from a key state
5840316 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5840317 we lit up your world like the fourth of july
5840318 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
5840319 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
5840320 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
5840321 even though the black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in the general election is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian
5840322 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5840323 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5840324 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5840325 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5840326 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5840327 so far its going good we have power and everything its just been windy and rainy
5840328 i think were going to all enjoy a nice summer day
5840329 right now they dont know if its a coincidence or not
5840330 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5840331 big cats and dinosaurs if you see any of those give us a call
5840332 once he perpetrated a fraud that goes into his credibility and integrity
5840333 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5840334 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5840335 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5840336 the lack of any reaction to putins attack for five days was followed by that stupid remark about the stock market
5840337 so this is the president do we have a president in russia at all it seems that we do not
5840338 television shapes public opinion on the tv screen putin looks more resolute than medvedev he uses strong words and has an image as a tough politician the masses like it
5840339 people are wary of draining their battery and not being able to make calls battery life isnt helped by having gps and wi fi turned on nor by having a large bright screen for navigation or web browsing
5840340 but there is clear demand for those features and applications and advances in battery technology would enable quite substantial changes in usage patterns with all the service revenue benefits that would bring
5840341 i think its donalds job to lose at that position right now and i say that in all honesty
5840342 people used to genuinely fear that they would lose their jobs if they were outed and many did
5840343 if you were found out it was absolutely the end
5840344 they had thrown a rock through my office window and it landed under my desk
5840345 there was glass all over my desk and on the floor
5840346 its getting really close to the first day of school and this threw a kink in things to say the least
5840347 quite a bit of vandalism we were able to get evidence and were sending it to the crime lab
5840348 as the school district gets pinched theyre looking at the food service to bring in revenue
5840349 yeah ive had a couple dreams like that where i messed up in my dream and heard his voice tell me i messed up
5840350 then i woke up and realized it was just a dream if you mess up hes going to let you know you messed up
5840351 i wanted to gain a little weight just to see what it would feel like to play at a heavier weight
5840352 ive always been 225 i just wanted to gain a little bit and keep my speed at the same time and see how that goes its fine right now i feel comfortable at 230 still running
5840353 im not as concerned about what the defense didnt do im worried what they did do and what they did do was do nothing
5840354 i thought there was some more leadership out there and there would be some people out there going crazy on defense it didnt materialize

5840367 hes set some high standards for himself and you like to see that
5840368 i need to be a complete tight end the game has evolved and tight ends do a lot more things now
5840369 he runs great routes and has good speed and good hands
5840370 we have a better handle right now at every spot on offense other than running back and thats pretty important
5840371 were still trying to see what are these guys best runs is it the counter play is it the sweep is it the zone play so were still trying to get that identified and that will take a little bit of time
5840372 you watch him run and can tell hes got power and speed hes one of those guys who always seems to fall forward you saw that last year with all the touchdowns he had
5840373 we saw him score a bunch of touchdowns with great runs
5840374 hes one of those guys whos in front of you one minute and then he slashes in another direction and hes by you you see defenders miss him a lot
5840375 chris hes a big powerful back but hes dropped his weight hes getting his speed back and hes much quicker
5840376 hes really been there for us throughout practice hell ask us questions to see if were paying attention hes really one of the guys everybody on the team looks up to
5840377 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words

5840412 the single most valuable thing that comes out of the combat casualty care meeting held each year is that it brings together u s and international expertise
5840413 an example is addressing the plan for improved training and how the army in particular is going to ensure competence in the future
5840414 as the exceptional training goes away its vitally important to sustain their professional abilities

5840450 the electromagnetic pulse generated by a high altitude nuclear explosion is one of a small number of threats that can hold our society at risk of catastrophic consequences
5840451 the separation of these infrastructures into different domains tends to obscure the real interdependencies that sustain the effectiveness and daily operation of each one
5840452 the increasingly pervasive use of electronics of all forms represents the greatest source of vulnerability to attack by emp electronics are used to control communicate compute store manage and implement nearly every aspect of u s civilian systems
5840453 should significant parts of the electric power infrastructure be lost for any substantial period of time the commission believes that the consequences are likely to be catastrophic and many people may ultimately die for lack of the basic elements necessary to sustain life in dense urban and suburban communities
5840454 our vulnerability is increasing daily as our use of and dependence on electronics continues to grow in both our civil and military sectors
5840455 what is significant about an emp attack is that one or a few high altitude nuclear detonations can produce emp effects that can potentially disrupt or damage electronic systems over much of the united states virtually simultaneously at a time determined by an adversary
5840456 iran the worlds leading sponsor of international terrorism has practiced launching a mobile ballistic missile from a vessel in the caspian sea
5840457 iranian military writings explicitly discuss an emp attack that would gravely harm the united states while the commission does not know the intention of iran in conducting these activities we are disturbed by the capability that emerges when we connect the dots
5840458 we need to cut through the red tape every service member should get electronic copies of medical and service records upon discharge
5840459 they became teachers and doctors cops and firefighters who were the foundation of our communities they became the innovators and small business owners who helped drive the american economy

5840474 ive started dating sharon stone and shes pretty good for 50
5840475 sharon called him and he showed the caller id to everyone
5840476 shes really into him and even asked him to come with her to mexico
5840477 i dont want to be his purse and i dont want to be his nurse
5840478 somebodys got to walk the line in the country theyve got to walk it unapologetically and im sure johnny cash would have been a john mccain supporter if he was still around
5840479 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so this is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation
5840480 as delaware sen joe biden left his home a few minutes ago golf clubs in tow he was asked where he was going to be on saturday biden replied here and pointed down to his driveway as he pulled out of
5840481 all democratic conventions since 1976 have just been television shows scripted fake and boring the american political equivalent of olympic opening ceremonies without the panache and so when the editors of tnr asked for 500 words on
5840482 the count at this point stood at six balls and no strike outs
5840483 i watched the man set the bird down pinning it gently under one knee and pulling its neck out across a narrow gutter for a moment the bird struggled beating its wings hard against the ground a few feathers dancing up pentagon comments on 10 french troops killed in afghanistan attack
5840484 former vice president al gore has accepted a speaking role on the final night of the democratic convention appearing on the same stage that barack obama will officially receive the democratic partys presidential nomination
5840485 mccain started out with the same sort of kibitzing campaign style that he used to woo the press back in 2000 it didnt work this time there were too many cameras around and too many 25 year old reporters and producers
5840486 paul mawhinney owns the largest collection of vinyl lps and 45s in the world because of the digital music frenzy and the dwindling interest in physical music formats paul was forced to close his record shop now facing diabetes and rising health costs hes put up his entire collection for sale if youve got 3 million and a place for 2 5 million records keep an eye on this one
5840487 marriage has certainly not come cheap for phil he has now made two of the biggest divorce payments in showbiz history
5840488 at least no one can accuse him of leaving his ex wives short when you compare what hes paid out relative to his own fortune the figures are enormous
5840489 you dont know who the baal megale amukot is and to what extent his ruling is respected here all gates of heaven are open before him hes like the son of the owner of heaven and all rejoice to do his will and what he decrees is immovable
5840490 it was not senseless fear we had while we were alive repenting in heaven is not a possibility
5840491 ashrecha vetov lach you have merited in the world to come
5840492 panu derech yashru mesilla ki tzaddik ba make way for the tzaddik
5840493 ashrei lo ve ashrei chelko fortunate he is and fortunate is his portion
5840494 wicked sinner of israel with such brazenness you rebelled against the commandments of the king of kings hakadosh baruch hu you were given a pure and clean soul and you were warned to guard it and retain in it holiness and purity in the end you defiled it with sins of worldly desires woe to you
5840495 has there ever been a wicked man like me to come here
5840496 who brought this wicked soul here all the fires of gehenom will not suffice for him
5840497 what sort of words are these of the baal megale amukot that he should decide to excuse this soul from all punishment he does not have so much authority as to give us instructions to accept the teshuva of this sinner that caused others to sin who fed non kosher food to a complete city of jews for decades just for the lust of money
5840498 why do you still scorn this soul is all the suffering endured during his lifetime not enough with such strength he revealed his sins in public and accepted shame and punishment he threw away all his money and all the honor he collected during his lifetime he gave up all earthly pleasures and endured three years of exile and excommunication and indescribable earthly tortures he accepted it all with love and humility if you were clothed with human bodies you wouldnt be able to endure such pains you would be broken immediately and would cease to do teshuva now you want to throw him into the fires of gehenom the holy rav baal megale amukot has stated that he has endured all the pain and tears and has emerged pure and clean without any traces of dirt now you want to call him wicked
5840499 let us all see what a catastrophe this soul caused with all his sins
5840500 he caused us to die by plague because of his sins
5840501 i died in my youth because this wicked man fed thousands with non kosher meat
5840502 we were children in yeshiva and had no taste of sin we could have been great torah sages but because of this wicked man we died young
5840503 we were young women we gave birth to children in holiness and purity we hoped to raise them to torah marriage and good deeds yet we died when we gave birth or shortly after and our children were left orphans without the love and care of a mother we have no rest in the grave the cries of our babies mouth torture us we constantly hover over them and when we see the harsh treatment they receive from nurses we burn inside for us there is no need for gehenom we have longed for the day when this wicked soul would come here and we will vengefully witness how he will languish in gehenom and now you say to let him free no way
5840504 its true that the defendant did all these terrible sins more abundant than the hair on his head but no one can deny that he was left an orphan at a tender age and was brought up under terrible conditions by a gross and brazen uncle he worked him like a slave and taught him no wisdom nor any religion or any fear of heaven he therefore fell prey to lust in worldly desires and was engrossed in sin without even realizing his evil deeds
5840505 also no one can deny that as soon as he realized the gravity of his deeds he immediately admitted them and regretted them and immediately did teshuva
5840506 and all this is because he realized the gravity of his sin and undertook to repent fully according to the instructions of the bet din of krakow here is the scroll from the baal megale amukot who testifies that he fully repented during his final days on earth
5840507 behold the judgment is explicit in the gemara since he already willingly accepted his punishment he is totally free of any taint of sins
5840508 just as he has been found in the lower court so will he be found in the higher court
5840509 all the souls and reincarnations that were waiting for their tikkun will now be perfected and are welcomed to enter gan eden
5840510 zakai hu baal tzaddik gamur hu he is innocent he is a complete tzaddik
5840511 continue as before with all your hardships and dont think for a moment to slacken it is better to withstand the most extreme torture in this world than to endure one moment of pain in gehenom the life of man eventually comes to an end but the life in the next world lasts for eternity
5840512 go to the baal megale amukot and tell him all i have told you even though he knows all this better than i tell him and ask him to tell this story throughout the world and they should print this story for the masses so that all should know the following
5840513 the preseason coaches poll is based on potential not performance
5840514 we have to work hard and see if the results on the court will match up to the goals of the team
5840515 we are still dealing with high fuel prices and the auto transport industry in general continues to face a challenging period but the recent drop in fuel costs should show up relatively quickly in the cost of transportation
5840516 another point of note is that the total volume of vehicles being transported via centraldispatch has increased pre owned vehicles are in greater demand in the slow economy so it makes sense that more vehicles are being transported
5840517 everyone has been picked for their particular skill its like when you get a great pop group when it gels it works
5840518 obviously we need the raw talent we are in the business of thoroughbreds so give us a donkey and we wont go anywhere
5840519 it goes against the grain of traditional thinking but were just here as expert advisers we do not dictate

5840535 we are concerned about drinking on campus were concerned about the binge drinking that occurs across the nation not just on this campus but across all campuses
5840536 weve continued to create this problem of binge drinking behind the scenes pushing it off campus into our local communities
5840537 the debate and the discussion is the major point of the amethyst initiative president sullivan has for a long time advocated opening up this discussion
5840538 i think the legal system has to be prepared to administer stiff penalties for people who do supply minors with alcohol
5840539 i think the question is will lowering the drinking age result in fewer deaths injuries and crimes committed and im not entirely sure thats the case
5840540 she was told they wouldnt broadcast anything that she was not happy with but jade said lets just deal with this head on there are going to be lots of questions and so on
5840541 the conversation she had with her doctor was entirely private and not recorded

5840584 lehman continues to have significant exposure to mortgages and asset backed securities
5840585 we believe management wants to leave its mortgage troubles behind and restore confidence
5840586 we dont think the ratings agencies would welcome this divestiture
5840587 there is virtually no chance that lehman can avoid huge losses on those 65 billion in mortgage and real estate securities i do not care what the alleged quality is compared to merrill
5840588 the hedges that lehman had put in place to cushion potential losses from mortgage investments went wrong adding to the red ink rather than minimizing it
5840589 the worst is yet to come in the u s

5840609 whilst im not 100 per cent happy that we have a review its far better to have the review than to all of a sudden be caught with your pants down and then be in real trouble

5840635 antonio ledezma es el candidato de la unidad as lo dicen las encuestas y se percibe en las calles por eso es que pedimos respeto al acuerdo unitario y dejar los inventos o formulas m gicas de ultima hora que no est n contempladas en el documento que suscribimos el 23 de enero a un poco m s de dos meses para la realizaci n de las elecciones regionales lo que debemos es estar en las calles present ndole a la gente nuestras propuestas de transformaci n de la ciudad
5840636 no puede ser un espacio para complacer caprichos pol ticos o antojitos mexicanos de algunos dirigentes las reglas est n claras solo hay que acatarlas y cumplirlas o nos unimos o nos hundimos arrastrando con nosotros las esperanzas de un pueblo que le exige al liderazgo que de una vez por todas se ponga pantalones largos para abordar de manera efectiva los grandes desaf os que tenemos por delante
5840637 con mucho respeto que no patee la mesa de la unidad y permita que desde ya los vecinos de caracas puedan so ar con una ciudad mucho mas humana que ac como ha referido en m ltiples ocasiones leopoldo l pez el nico plan b que existe es el de respetar el plan a que lo representa la unidad que como manifest stanly gonz lez las reglas estaban claras y quienes pretendan ahora exigir otro tipo de mecanismo para la selecci n de candidatos tan solo puede ser calificado como un rompe grupo
5840638 golpe de estado a la constituci n y la democracia
5840639 aventaja ampliamente al resto de los candidatos tal como lo reflejan todas las encuestas
5840640 creemos y estamos comprometidos con la unidad as lo hemos demostrado permanentemente creemos en la unidad con los ciudadanos y sus ideas para as promover los verdaderos cambios y la transformaci n que tanto requiere el pa s por eso haremos lo humanamente posible para preservar la integridad del esp ritu y la esencia del acuerdo del 23 de enero

5840706 joe has been so productive somebody like joe and a team with a need should be a perfect fit
5840707 it was just mentally wearing him down more than physically

5840712 there are reports suggesting he bashar along with four associates including a doctor stayed at a mosque in dura village located 8 km from fatehpur sikri
5840713 now that we have seen his picture we can say it with confidence it was bashar who stayed in the mosque along with his accomplices giving provocative speeches

5840734 there are vulnerabilities all around the australian coastline she said
5840735 it is an issue of significant magnitude and it does need proper assessment and all governments working together to minimise the risks and ensure there is as little damage as possible
5840736 this really is very early work and many more factors need to be taken into account before we have concrete projections she said
5840737 it is going to be a negative story leading to damage of assets and loss of value
5840738 the evidence over the past 12 to 18 months suggests that we have underestimated how fast this aspect of the earths system can change he said
5840739 most complex and difficult challenge we have faced as a species
5840740 in the 21st century a sea level rise of at least 0 5 metres is a certainty a rise of 1 to 1 5 metres is more likely while a rise of up to four metres this century is possible he said
5840741 the pressing reality of climate change is upon us and all the evidence points to coastlines being the most vulnerable she said adding that there would be considerable damage to coastal settlements in particular aboriginal communities
5840742 im not saying that anyone would be forced to do anything because im a federalist and believe in the rights of states but at the same time theres already been discussion amongst the states and i believe that more discussion amongst the governors is probably something that everybody wants us to do
5840743 just last year the seven states entered into a new implementing agreement and that agreement is working as intended it would be sheer folly to re open the compact at a time like this when all of the states are working cooperatively on this issue
5840744 no systematic differences between cultivation systems representing organic and conventional production methods were found across the five crops so the study does not support the belief that organically grown foodstuffs generally contain more major and trace elements than conventionally grown foodstuffs
5840745 overall organic farming is better for tackling climate change than industrial agricultural methods as well as lower average energy use organic farming also avoids the very large nitrous oxide emissions from fertilizer manufacture
5840746 additionally organic farming builds up soil carbon removing it from the atmosphere organic farming also supports more local food marketing reducing food miles
5840747 local farmers are involved in cultivating oregano parsley thyme peppermint rosemary rose geranium artimisia stevia lemon grass and several other herbal and medicinal plants
5840748 our approach is two pronged firstly we are trying to build awareness about organic farming which is in its infancy in india and secondly we are trying to build awareness within the culinary industry in india
5840749 the response has been very positive they are overwhelmed that we are going so close to nature and that their food is fresh from the farmland to the table
5840750 the sole multilateral environmental agreement on land and soil degradation
5840751 a platform to address the important issue of climate change and soil
5840752 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5840753 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that
5840754 he slept on his arm the other night and he came in and felt some tingling in his fingertips
5840755 as far as pain goes its not that much pain at all with it its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered until now

5840778 lo hemos dicho con toda claridad que de cualquier parte del mundo quien solicite un asilo a nicaragua sabe que lo tiene porque es una necesidad humanitaria agreg el canciller

5840794 and were seeing tremendous interest in getting canadian crude into the philadelphia market
5840795 we looked at whether canada could reduce exports for the sake of conservation or environmental policy or even for household heating we cannot
5840796 and figuring out how we can make this work for all people
5840797 the canadians might look for other options if we became difficult customers
5840798 if it turns out that these technologies dont advance and the only way to produce these resources would be at a significant penalty to climate change then we dont believe that those resources are going to be part of the long term future
5840799 there is a huge infrastructure investment being made in a fuel that in our view is taking us in the wrong direction its making it more difficult for us to fully address the global warming issue

5840901 se durmi sobre su brazo la otra noche y cuando entr sinti cierto hormigueo en las yemas de los dedos creo que esto no le ayud a colocar sus lanzamientos
5840902 la tarea es coordinarnos en una misma l nea y la misi n es que el equipo califique de nueva cuenta
5840903 volver a casa en esta nueva etapa y en una nueva faceta implica retos y por eso estoy muy contento es para mi un sue o cumplido que de ser jugador del club ahora sea parte de la directiva
5840904 siempre ha tenido la posibilidad de ganar es uno de los m s importante del pa s y est a la altura de cualquera
5840905 what were calling for at this point is not legislation not a change of law but a discussion on the merits of how we handle the culture of alcohol in our society
5840906 we enforce we suspend but we do very little in terms of being able to educate them and setting models for them
5840907 i think its great for things to get done somebodys got to take a stand
5840908 i have a very good friend who was born and raised in italy and said when he was very young his grandmother set him down with a glass of wine at dinner they didnt go out and act irresponsible because it was no big deal but weve made it a big deal in our country i think 19 would be a very appropriate age
5840909 there are a lot of very drastic things that have changed with him his personality and his social skills with other children
5840910 he has whats called trace memory decay where he loses about 30 of his information that he gets so you can teach him a new skill and if its not repetitively reinforced with him hell lose that information
5840911 there is no question that the student is eligible for services and the school wants to provide services this is a case where the parents and school district disagree about what is appropriate
5840912 this suggests that arsenic would play a role in the development of diabetes
5840913 but there clearly needs to be additional research conducted because our study has certain limitations we are conducting those studies now but thats going to take a few years
5840914 this is a good base for future research but its a small sample size and doesnt look at dose response
5840915 in terms of magnitude people in taiwan and bangladesh are exposed to at least 10 times higher levels compared to people in the u s
5840916 we were interested in investigating if arsenic exposure at low and moderate levels could be related to diabetes
5840917 when we adjusted for diabetes risk factors and for markers of seafood intake we found this moderate to strong relationship between arsenic and the prevalence of diabetes
5840918 there are still many americans with arsenic in drinking water at levels above safety standards
5840919 this reinforces how important it is that all drinking water is below this standard the good news is that we can actually do something to eliminate arsenic from water
5840920 we estimate that more than 16 000 residents travel along kessler each day so these drainage problems are a great inconvenience to commuters and they really affect the traffic flow

5840923 im proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for 1 billion reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia
5840924 there have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage and no reports of incidents for any other ipod nano model
5840925 la verdad me pregunto qu pasa veo la repetici n los comentarios primero digo que no me conocen y a partir de su desconocimiento hablan opinan y ver cualquier jugada en futbol en c mara lenta no tiene ning n punto de comparaci n con la realidad y mil sima de segundo en que se desarrolla cada movimiento de futbol
5840926 lo primero que se les ocurri decir es que si a horacio cervantes le dieron tres fechas a esta jugada tiene que ser m nimo tres o cuatro eso me da para pensar que tiene otro fondo no s lo la jugada que no miden s lo la intenci n miden todo el espect culo estamos acostumbrados a recibir golpes del mismo lugar
5840927 esto es un negocio son dos televisoras importantes que siempre est n disput ndose cosas extrafutbol sticas en medio estuvo la expulsi n de cervantes no s quien present el video o c mo se lleg a la determinaci n de que le dieran tres fechas
5840928 hay cosas que me tiene podrido y van a seguir sucediendo no s lo conmigo con otros jugadores y hay que acostumbrarse esta disputa como jugador por momentos me tiene cansado pero es parte de lo que vivimos
5840929 en el futbol mexicano suceden cosas que no pasan en otro futbol me tengo que adaptar jugu en dos pa ses aparte de ac y nunca vi que la rivalidad entre dos televisoras hagan hablar bien o mal de un equipo o se ensa en con un jugador
5840930 en algunas ocasiones he dicho que los naturalizados le quitan el derecho a un mexicano de estar ah en la selecci n pero hay que trabajar y demostrar en la cancha que podemos estar ah
5840931 m xico debe ganar porque tiene buenos jugadores que est n muy bien preparados para hacer un buen trabajo creo que van a salir con el resultado
5840932 es un equipo que siempre sale por la victoria pero nosotros vamos a hacer nuestro partido y tratar de mantener el cero y meter las que tengamos
5840933 y desde el principio salir con todo para no tener problemas debemos evitar que el rival tenga la pelota y nos haga da o hay que tratar de neutralizarlo
5840934 a muchos amigos pero ahora me toca estar de este lado y vamos a ponerle intensidad y entrega al encuentro para tratar de ganarlo
5840935 fueron v ctimas de la violencia que lamentablemente esta viviendo chihuahua el estado norte o al que pertenece ciudad ju rez y el pa s completo
5840936 reprobamos y lamentamos profundamente que el deporte como muchos otros mbitos sea privado de talentosos mexicanos y m s aun de amigos profundamente queridos y estimados por nuestra comunidad
5840937 vas a dejar que eso te pase a ti llega fuerte con la mano en la pared
5840938 todo lo que falta en brasil es m s competiciones en los torneos en estados unidos miro hacia el lado y est phelps as te acostumbras a competir con los mejores en brasil tenemos buenas competencias pero es diferente del nivel del exterior en mi caso cualquier cent sima vale mucho
5840939 el oro lleg pero quiero bajar mi tiempo cada vez m s lo m s dif cil no es ganarle a los otros y s a uno mismo el nadador conoce su l mite y la nataci n es una lucha diaria cada vez m s van a aparecer dificultades por lo que es preciso creer siempre

5840941 i know everybodys scared right now but its just so over the top
5840942 mortgage debt is viewed as much riskier now than it was a couple of years ago during the housing boom
5840943 probably about a year ago that would have been fine
5840944 the tightening of the guidelines by fannie mae and freddie mac as a result of the mortgage collapse have had a rippling effect with all lenders and all loan types
5840945 its very difficult to imagine a scenario in which the federal government doesnt step in
5840946 visually refined from the outset shop like anna seems to be place that many in its target audience will likely latch onto that is if its initial promotional push proves effective of course it has all the makings of a niche venue that could carry and grow to a popular standing among competitors the amount of material isnt voluminous at present mind you its more kindling than flame really but if security conscious web users parents and children alike want for a site that enables a rich interactive experience through a variety of features shop like anna is one player that truly seems to manage an appreciably qualitative balance

5840974 raising the drinking age has a direct effect on reducing alcohol related traffic accidents among youths affected by the laws on average across the states
5840975 raising the drinking age also results in a decline in alcohol consumption and in driving after drinking for the age group affected by the law

5840984 no estamos promoviendo una pol mica porque ser a lo menos recomendable en este momento pero tampoco una confrontaci n sino un llamado a la sensatez a la prudencia y si se quiere a la jurisprudencia para que este asunto se resuelva con base en razones y con base a derecho
5840985 que nos quedemos ah por que hay causas por las que no se claudica y los ciudadanos tiene que luchar por el respeto a la vida
5840986 vulnerar este derecho o lo que es lo mismo crear excepciones para su vigencia universal y plena nos coloca a todos en un escenario de riesgos del que nos lamentaremos si no tomamos las medidas necesarias en el presente
5840987 cumpl con el capricho de grabar un disco ranchero que era lo que quer a hacer desde el principio
5840988 canto ranchero desde que tengo siete a os primero como solista y luego con mi padre

5840995 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
5840996 as i understand it it was a complex attack involving multiple weapons systems small arms mortars rockets and it lasted for several hours
5840997 im not ready to declare any sort of new insurgent strategy
5840998 the attacks do symbolize the importance of the u s coalition mission in afghanistan
5840999 i think its a reflection of the fact that this is an enemy that needs to be taken on
5841000 this is a difficult time right now for the families and friends of those who died or were injured and we offer them our sincere condolences and sympathies
5841001 the lives of these soldiers are irreplaceable but this loss does not deter isaf from supporting the people of afghanistan in their fight against the enemies of peace and stability
5841002 this is another example of the enemies of afghanistans complete disregard for the people of afghanistan and the rule of law
5841003 its a celebration expo style of women in business for themselves
5841004 there are over 50 vendors signed up and they are all women in business for themselves
5841005 lets face it its going to happen fake blogs are coming in fact theyre already going on now i may not like it but whether or not i like it isnt important its happening and its going to continue to happen the problem is that we havent developed the cues to recognize flogs
5841006 he is 12 years old and a wonderful cat but i would like to travel now so you should find him a nice home

5841024 eight for eight and in the 112 year history of the modern olympic games more than 100 000 athletes have competed in summer and winter games only one has won eight gold medals in a single olympics that is the kind of feat that just may never be surpassed and certainly one of the greatest feats of sports history
5841025 i remember him sitting in the clubhouse next to my locker after the 1978 playoff game vs the yankees crying like a baby
5841026 he was a fierce competitor he wasnt the most talented hall of famer but nobody outworked him
5841027 we recognize our goal to maintain and enhance the highest aviation safety record in the world and we look forward to working with congress as the results of our ongoing reviews are concluded
5841028 first legislative step in reversing the complacency over safety regulation that has set in at the highest levels of the federal aviation administration
5841029 what we were trying to do is eliminate some of the relationships that build up and make certain there was some oversight over those relationships
5841030 we dont want to lose the best of the best
5841031 this legislation is not a silver bullet that will produce a comprehensive solution to problems that have been developing for years
5841032 we will certainly work with the inspector general as they go through their audits
5841033 weve got the most experienced and well trained workforce in the industry and we not only maintain our aircraft but we maintain other airlines aircraft as well
5841034 this is a great mystery and i never expected this accident to be this difficult to solve given the state of art tools on the plane and the fact that the aircraft was largely intact
5841035 this has potentially broad implications that go beyond this one airplane depending on what they find
5841036 we suggest people avoid speculation and wait for the formal publication of findings at the conclusion of the inquiry
5841037 we used to have this season from october to april where we had a chance for a storm
5841038 when you pull the storm track north it takes the storms with it
5841039 during the period its raining less it also tends to be warmer than it used to be
5841040 were starting to see the impacts of climate change in the late winter and early spring particularly in the southwest its a season specific kind of drought
5841041 were used to thinking about climate change as happening sometime in the future to someone else but this is right here and affects us now the future is here
5841042 its very rare that you get this distribution by chance
5841043 were definitely seeing continual shifts the great unwashed those people who have never sent a text message is getting smaller all the time
5841044 hopefully it will help the people who run charter schools to take a step back and determine if they have these elements in their schools and if not try to bring them into their schools
5841045 if it helps people rededicate themselves to why they got into the charter business in the first place hopefully to make a difference for the students education then this report will do it
5841046 we are happy to receive recognition but happier to hear one of our children was the number 1 student in norths north high schools international baccalaureate program and is getting into cornell
5841047 were working on how we can take what we learned and implement it for every single kid in every single charter school
5841048 charter schools in arizona can be a critical part of that revival
5841049 es una experiencia importante en mi carrera he estado en brasil en turqu a y en italia pero el f tbol espa ol es el m s importante y creo que el celta va a cambiar mi vida
5841050 en absoluto el celta es un equipo de tradici n conocido internacionalmente lo importante es estar en un equipo como el celta de vigo
5841051 yo no quer a ir al reggina desde que mi agente comenz las conversaciones con el celta para mi era muy importante venir
5841052 hice la pretemporada con el reginna trabajamos 30 d as y particip en cinco partidos amistosos
5841053 destaca en el aspecto ofensivo ya que se caracteriza por dar muchas asistencias de gol
5841054 para haber jugado de lateral en italia hay que saber defender
5841055 en teor a est n los mejores jugadores de m xico en el tricolor y en el papel son los m s capaces es el primer partido de eriksson con el equipo y la gente va a poner todo de su parte no se va a guardar nada porque nunca se deber a guardar nada
5841056 no se deber a guardar nada porque hay veces que as sucede pero en este partido van a jugar todos al 100 por ciento y llegar con la ilusi n de ganarse un puesto ante un rival que siempre se le ha complicado pero la idea es ganar s o s
5841057 si se juega bien excelente pero si no se juega bien y se gana tiene que ser la primicia porque siempre con un resultado favorable se tiene m s cordialidad para trabajar con el grupo
5841058 creo que la gente de europa trabaja bien puede utilizar un 4 4 2 con los que auxilian al t cnico nacional no creo que eso sea un factor que haya sido hecho al vapor
5841059 hay que estar con los amigos en las buenas y las malas aqu estar cuando despierte
5841060 s son presas de la desesperaci n todo por el af n de querer mostrarse por ah me parece que tenemos que estar tranquilos queremos que sean protagonistas los jugadores quieren demostrar y nosotros tambi n pero me parece que hay que darle tiempo a esto y estoy seguro que el equipo va a responder bien
5841061 mala intenci n de parte de l al contrario creo que la gente de pachuca estuvo muy bien porque no fue un golpe para lastimarlo lo hemos charlado con l
5841062 estamos hablando con los jugadores que errores de ese tipo mo podemos cometer m s porque se va hacer cuesta arriba en lo que viene y no solo en lo que estas jugando sino tambi n en lo que viene tenemos un plantel numeroso que juega bien pero en estos cinco partidos no he podido armar el equipo que quiero
5841063 hemos mejorado desde mi punto de vista en el aspecto t ctico el conocer a los jugadores el c mo est n el c mo han trabajado
5841064 un inicio como el que tuvimos al final del partido que sea desde el inicio estuvieron bien t cticamente no dejaron jugar al pachuca no nos crearon situaciones pr cticamente me gustar a que tuviera ese protagonismo y es lo que vamos a hacer
5841065 i think we took for granted how innovative the game was
5841066 but what were also seeing is for the people who dont like it generally just dont get it and its because weve created something so innovative and different
5841067 its ironic it just shows that human nature of if you dont understand something you immediately attack it its pretty interesting in that regard
5841068 ellos tienen que justificar de lo contrario tendr n que devolver la plata
5841069 conjuntamente con las 30 transitorias fueron votados debatidos y no como sostienen personas sin informaci n existen videos audios actas que respaldan las resoluciones
5841070 los que est n se alando ahora que el r gimen de transici n es absurdo dir an que estamos instaurando una dictadura eso es irrazonable
5841071 es una de las personas que m s valoro y respeto en este pa s por ese cari o le he hecho llegar una carta cordial porque somos amigos creo que le confundieron y tiene alg n grado de desinformaci n supone que la constituci n podr a estar modificando la bandera el himno o el escudo la asamblea no le dedic ni un segundo a estos temas creamos en la constituci n un cap tulo sobre la libertad y aqu jam s se va a confiscar a nadie la lengua
5841072 no s si a n en mi ecuador esta es la bandera y este el escudo como ahora andamos con nueva asamblea constituyente cambiando todo
5841073 no s si estar regresando y a n tengo democracia no estoy criticando ni a uno ni a otro simplemente es incertidumbre sin saber lo que est pasando
5841074 prefiero que me recuerden como aquel muchacho que vende peri dicos en la calle y que a dios gracias lleg a ser el mejor del mundo
5841075 we got it to work but it was too late in the development cycle
5841076 despite an expected decrease in game segment sales as a result of a decline in sales for the playstation 2 business
5841077 due to hardware cost reductions and an enhanced line up of software titles in the ps3 business
5841078 well for one thing its not carved and for another it came out of jesus own mouth not some human idea so it cant be a graven image
5841079 i just walked right on past him to the bedroom and got my gun
5841080 i said what are you doing in my house he just kept saying he didnt do it
5841081 la afiliaci n es permanente s lo que el d a de hoy arranca porque el presidente de la rep blica felipe calder n hinojosa dio el banderazo tambi n y quiere que en todos los estados se inicie para que tenga un buen impacto a nivel nacional
5841082 they were doing what each one of the characters was doing in a way or another
5841083 they got caught with their pants down from a small storm and they could not recover
5841084 another group of people commented about how it was crazy that they were cheering that the plane was going to arrive four hours late
5841085 a plan to profitability by the end of the month
5841086 eclipse will not be releasing any further information or conducting interviews surrounding this media alert at this time
5841087 and planned purchases of components from aec and other suppliers for the remainder of 2008 and the first half of 2009 purchases of aec components are thereafter expected to return to and then exceed previous levels
5841088 you know watson did it sergio has not been able to do it
5841089 i would say the message is we were disappointed with our performance at e3 there were titles like wario which we think will be really fun titles that we should have showcased
5841090 the computer and video game industry will be well protected with kens guidance
5841091 la objeci n de conciencia es un derecho fundamental dentro de una filosof a de la no violencia y la cultura de paz el tema del servicio militar preocupa porque las pr cticas autoritarias y de violencia se van trasladando a todos los mbitos de la sociedad
5841092 el derecho a la objeci n de conciencia que no podr menoscabar otros derechos ni causar da o a las personas o a la naturaleza
5841093 toda persona tiene derecho a negarse a usar la violencia y a participar en el servicio militar
5841094 los militares y cualquier persona tienen la facultad de oponerse a realizar una orden que vaya en contra de los derechos de las personas
5841095 este art culo llama a la coherencia llama a defender la vida los principios que eso conlleva una lucha de 12 a os en 1997 era fatal hablar de objeci n de conciencia ahora hay una sensibilidad para no ver a esta como una propuesta de cobard a ni de odio a la patria sino al contrario como una propuesta de entrega al pa s para desterrar la violencia
5841096 es absolutamente positiva la inclusi n de la objeci n de conciencia porque el servicio militar era una privaci n de derechos fundamentales adem s que promov a el uso de la violencia en nombre de la patria cuando esto solo ha servido para hacer defender a las clases con dinero
5841097 el derecho a la objeci n de conciencia que no podr menoscabar otros derechos ni causar da o a las personas o a la naturaleza toda persona tiene derecho a negarse a usar la violencia y a participar en el servicio militar el servicio c vico militar es voluntario este se realizar en el marco del respeto a la diversidad y a los derechos y estar acompa ado de una capacitaci n en diversos campos que coadyuven al desarrollo quienes participen en este servicio no ser n destinados a reas de alto riesgo militar
5841098 with pole dancing classes springing up in gyms and health clubs across europe and the usa the number of women seeking the body sculpting and fat burning effects of this aerobic form of exercise has never been greater

5841104 hey i lost some shit out in the jungle would you go get it for me
5841105 he was so deadly in fact that his enemies would go blind through over exposure to pure awesomeness
5841106 they have done everything they can think of to nickel and dime us this summer
5841107 caps do not necessarily translate into significant reductions in delays or an increase in airline on time performance
5841108 over the next 18 months the prospects look very dismal
5841109 the u s industry is facing its biggest challenge since the inception of commercial air travel
5841110 in advance of the premature national transportation safety boards recommendation
5841111 all fleet operators using the eclipse 500 already have complied with the inspection requirement and their aircraft are in the air operating normally
5841112 we are cooperating fully with the faa investigation and have communicated everything we know and have learned about this situation to our eclipse 500 customers and operators
5841113 it was quick and simple for us to put the additional pages into the aircraft flight manuals and do the simple test of the throttles
5841114 this is the inevitable consequence of the high fuel costs
5841115 when you put an airplane on the ground you stop consuming fuel so theres an immediate benefit
5841116 any changes purchase underwriting criteria still clearly came far too late to prevent gse fannie from taking a direct credit hit now that the alt a mortgage class is the latest area of mortgages to go through a meltdown and many borrowers are defaulting at a seemingly parabolic rate each month and each quarter
5841117 the strategy isnt all that surprising as nearly anyone in the mortgage business these days is looking for a reason to push the bad loans and the losses associated with them off of their books and onto someone elses and in the case of alt a theres likely to be more than a just a fair amount of income misrepresentation among other sorts of fraud
5841118 little fences are only for keeping good people out of trouble
5841119 were upgrading airline drinking water standards to first class status with better testing treatment and maintenance
5841120 we were well within testing ranges of any municipal drinking water supply system
5841121 i dont think carriers can be relied upon to do self audits especially in this economic climate
5841122 battlestar galactica marathon or maybe thats just me even the dali lama is said to have a passion for expensive watches
5841123 thats where i get my news except of course for the mercury news ive only got maybe 30 minutes a night to watch tv and ill take anything on comedy central i love the political satire i also really like south park especially kenny
5841124 how did you know my one problem with junk food is cheez its
5841125 my mother loved them and i have to stay away from them im not tempted by chocolates or anything sweet but i have to watch out for those cheez its
5841126 my guilty pleasure is ebay the most comprehensive museum ever imagined
5841127 i try to find at least one item there for each show just check out the 1960s rolodex file in our production of doubt center stage on sister aloysiuss desk i love the idea that the perfect detail is actually available somewhere and i can search the entire country to find it
5841128 on the weekend i like to let my hair down what little i have left of it
5841129 and just be a regular guy blend in with the crowd im a relaxed rider where you put your leather jacket on and sit back its definitely freedom you feel like its just you and the elements its refreshing
5841130 thats a secret pleasure for me i dont even know exactly why i like it so much except that is has dench and she could gargle and id love it
5841131 my foodie friends would not be pleased but whenever i need a little lift maybe every three months or so i eat an entire tub of frozen cool whip its soothing its cold and i love it
5841132 if i can hit the gym between 12 and 1 my guilty pleasure is to reward myself for sweating by watching the e news and then the daily ten on the e channel at least i can honestly say ive never watched it just sitting down
5841133 ill eat anything kraft macaroni amp cheese im old school i like the kind with the powder i also like liverwurst or fried bologna sandwiches because my dad used to make them hes german but honestly i am surrounded by the other stuff at work so when i get home i like to keep it simple
5841134 no not the unwanted messages you get in your e mail the spam luncheon meat that comes in the rectangular blue can i grew up eating it spam and eggs spam and rice spam musubi with sushi rice wrapped in seaweed i prefer not to create anything too complicated like the spam sandwiches suggested on its container id rather have pure unadulterated spam next time youre feeling a bit under the weather try this spam with macaroni peas and chicken broth yum
5841135 i love horror films not just because i crave the goose bump factor of a good evisceration but also because horror is one of the most metaphorically rich genres of the post modern age
5841136 horror is an allegory for existence teeth takes a bite out of sexism in society the last winter fast forwards to the rising tide of global warming even the granddaddy of modern monster movies jaws indicts the pettiness of business interests determined to keep the beaches open no matter whats in the water horror intimately reflects who we are what we want and what scares the capri pants off us from hamlet to hostel horror is as fundamental to human existence as comedy and tragedy its like beckett only with disemboweling whats not to love
5841137 to add stronger more prominent warnings in the product label
5841138 despite the success of our partnership we understand thatpriorities change and wish chevron the best in implementing itsnew marketing initiatives
5841139 were working hard to make sure that the is are dottedand the ts are crossed this time
5841140 global warming deniers forced to cancel meeting due to tropical storm fay
5841141 for the rights to control publicity related to a dead bigfoot
5841142 his top contenders are said to include minnesota gov tim pawlenty and former massachusetts gov mitt romney less traditional choices mentioned include former pennsylvania gov tom ridge an abortion rights supporter and connecticut sen joe lieberman the democratic vice presidential prick in 2000 who now is an independent
5841143 most of my ceos dont have time to scratch their ass never mind build and execute a blogosphere strategy or pitch secure and manage a segment on the today show
5841144 race is not real it is just a social and cultural construct and has no biological validity
5841145 you wont get anything that remotely tracks conventional race categories
5841146 race as a way of organizing what we know about that variation is incredibly simplified there is no organizing principle by which you could put 5 billion people into so few categories in a way that would tell you anything important about humankinds diversity
5841147 it is unlikely that a doctor would guess that optimal drug dosages might differ for drs watson and venter
5841148 race ethnicity should be considered only a makeshift solution for personalized genomics because it is too approximate
5841149 si el presidente les autoriza a usar su imagen a pais es su problema
5841150 no hace falta gastar cinco millones de d lares en ese trabajo
5841151 si no hay resultados claros si hay empate t cnico igual se lo dir pero explicando las razones
5841152 previo al exit poll realizaremos el seguimiento de la tendencia con la que se llega al plebiscito
5841153 no creo necesario hacer un conteo r pido si hay encuestadoras autorizadas para los exit polls
5841154 al hacer el exit poll se le pide al encuestado que sufrague como lo hizo en la junta receptora del voto
5841155 si se publican en la prensa yo no puedo hacer nada porque no est n bajo mi autoridad
5841156 pues la exhibici n tiene un efecto de empeorar la seguridad al crear un clima de intolerancia y de inseguridad frente a las formas extremas de violencia
5841157 no ser el primer pa s en el mundo en el que las escenas de violencia que puedan afectar a la dignidad de la persona sean reguladas
5841158 la cr nica roja es en s misma una degradaci n del ser humano porque la muerte y el dolor son personales y si se comercializan creo que estamos atentando contra el pudor
5841159 pero obviamente seguiremos cumpliendo con el trabajo de cubrir los hechos cotidianos
5841160 ser a un acto claro de coartar la libertad de informaci n y expresi n
5841161 ya hab a una censura popular por mostrar fotograf as crueles no solo los adultos ven esos diarios sino los ni os esto sirve para que los medios sean m s prudentes
5841162 con esta medida se quiere poner fin a una especie de inequidad en la que solo los pobres sal an exhibidos y no los ricos o pelucones
5841163 i knew it i knew it i knew i was getting this i knew it
5841164 there is no airline right now that has a long term viable business plan
5841165 airlines are going to add as many fees as humanly possible
5841166 they dont need the market to approve fees like they do with fare increases this is an easier way to get revenue and they can be extremely lucrative
5841167 it was obviously a very difficult and challenging quarter for us and the industry
5841168 they have just barely managed to work their way back to some semblance of profitability and this will probably turn the cycle back around in the other direction
5841169 based on where we sit today we are nowhere near recovering from this extraordinary increase in fuel price
5841170 you know frankly you can imagine that if we have a fee we are evaluating raising it

5841407 truth is that social media is the responsibility of the champions that demonstrate how it will benefit the company and the brand
5841408 the ou initiative is the only major u s initiative of its kind devoted to the problem of biodeterioration and biocorrosion
5841409 first we have to understand how mother nature cleans up these spills and we can do this by studying the way microorganisms interact with hydrocarbons
5841410 we want to better understand how organisms eat through these pipelines several fundamental mechanisms cause this problem but it is spotty and doesnt occur all of a sudden rather biocorrosion occurs over a long period of time and we are using a series of new molecular and chemical tools to find out why and how this happens
5841411 we think cells grow in communities that adhere to the inner surface of pipelines and form three dimensional biofilms that can sometimes cause pitting once we understand what these microorganisms are doing we can interrupt their processes or diagnose them more effectively the science is rudimentary at this stage the modern tools of molecular microbiology have not been applied yet but a national science foundation grant support from the does joint genome institute and the cooperation of the energy industry allowed us to study pipeline biocorrosion on the north slope
5841412 for many years no one ever thought anaerobes could grow by metabolizing hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen but that is simply wrong the organisms are actually quite good at it the underlying mechanisms will be even more important as we introduce newer biofuels to augment our fossil fuel supply we are putting new fuel combinations into the existing pipelines that service the entire country the new biofuels can be less stable so there is a different problem to deal with the chemistry of biofuels may not allow us to store them as long and more research is needed to determine the stability compatability and composition of such fuel mixtures
5841413 because two thirds of u s oil is still in place we can use these organisms to convert residual hydrocarbons into natural gas and create a new source of domestic energy the concept of anaerobic metabolism is an innovative process and the ou initiative is the only one of its kind in the united states at the present time we are also experimenting with shales and other unconventional reservoirs
5841414 biotechnology can influence recovery and address some of todays problems if we can understand how microorganisms degrade hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen ou is one of the top universities in the world to study anaerobic microbiology with 14 experts performing research in some aspect of this field it is rare for universities to have even a single individual with this specialization ou is an exciting place to be if you are an environmental microbiologist this initiative has unified this group of experts and led to the groundbreaking research we have just begun to understand
5841415 we know that bacterial cells communicate much like those that cause disease if we know the language they use we can send signals and interrupt their communications so they will change their behavior the best way to treat the biocorrosion problem has not yet been determined active ongoing monitoring of pipelines tells us there is an ongoing process but we need to get to the problem before it gets to the critical stage some and perhaps most microorganisms are not routinely monitored so we have to understand the role they play in this process information we can use to more effectively diagnose and treat the consequences
5841416 are laudable and the circumstances motivating its enactment deplorable only the federal government has the authority to enact such a law
5841417 the courts decision vindicates the position of ata and the airlines that airline services are regulated by the federal government and that a patchwork of laws by states and localities would be impractical and harmful to consumer interests
5841418 this clear and decisive ruling sends a strong message to other states that are considering similar legislation
5841419 it reaches the point of claustrophobia i would probably hit the emergency door and get arrested
5841420 it was just icing on the cake for a terrible year
5841421 i added up all the time i was delayed last year and it was probably a week of my life i am annoyed there is no other way to describe it it just makes your blood boil
5841422 i am leaving with the satisfaction that whatever i could do for this country i did it with integrity
5841423 i am a human too i may have made mistakes but i believe that the people will forgive me
5841424 it should have happened much earlier the dictatorship should have been done away with some time ago
5841425 if hes man enough and as he has said he has done nothing wrong he should stand trial
5841426 pave the way for true democracy to flourish in pakistan
5841427 theres going to be enormous pressure on the civilian government from the american administration to get their acts together to show that they can confront militancy in pakistan
5841428 it will be a test of the coalition which i think will fall apart
5841429 they have to address the immediate issues like inflation and the long term structural problems of pakistani polity they cant use musharraf as an excuse any more
5841430 it is a change about the democratic spirit and transition and the establishment of constitutionality
5841431 it is now really a test of their ability and a test of their capacity to deliver
5841432 politics are inherently competitive but the ruling coalition partners are likely to stay together for a while
5841433 he was indias best bet in pakistan we will miss musharraf
5841434 if he had not fired his judges and gotten bogged down in domestic dramas i believe we would have been able to make a significant breakthrough in a peace deal in kashmir today
5841435 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan
5841436 still musharraf was a one man go to guy in pakistan now who do we speak to these are very uncertain times
5841437 so keep fightin for freedom and justice beloveds but dont you forget to have fun doin it lord let your laughter ring forth be outrageous ridicule the fraidy cats rejoice in all the oddities that freedom can produce and when you get through kickin ass and celebratin the sheer joy of a good fight be sure to tell those who come after how much fun it was
5841438 i am leaving with the satisfaction that whatever i could do for this country i did it with integrity
5841439 i am a human too i may have made mistakes but i believe that the people will forgive me
5841440 it should have happened much earlier the dictatorship should have been done away with some time ago
5841441 if hes man enough and as he has said he has done nothing wrong he should stand trial

5841451 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan

5841454 im pretty much a fan that if youve been trained if you are registered then you ought to be able to carry a weapon
5841455 it is prudent to minimize arsenic exposure while its effect on metabolic diseases continues to be researched
5841456 we knew all a along there were more people it wouldnt surprise me if more people came forward next week
5841457 our top priority is to assist our customers particularly those who already have begun their travel with us in securing alternative flight accommodations
5841458 i sincerely apologize to our shareholders employees customers and suppliers
5841459 our efforts to raise additional capital have been unsuccessful i deeply regret any inconvenience caused
5841460 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5841461 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5841462 coupling the two you have slow growth with higher inflation
5841463 its great that you recognize that bob but more importantly are preparing to do something about it
5841464 to live your life in your physical action close the situation
5841465 well its just an using open houses and i am tired of having to deal with it
5841466 so bob what is the greatest issue that you face with your payroll today
5841467 esta acci n y la doble posibilidad de uso para su programa de misiles bal sticos son inconsistentes con sus obligaciones ante el consejo de seguridad de la onu
5841468 exagera deliberadamente sus xitos espaciales y a reos para disuadir a israel y a estados unidos de atacar sus sitios nucleares
5841469 est claro que ir n posee desde hace a os misiles bal sticos shahab 3 cuyo alcance llega a israel pero la amenaza de ir n proviene de su programa nuclear y no de sus sat lites o de sus misiles bal sticos
5841470 seguimos monitoreando la situaci n y es probablemente algo pronto pero hoy no hemos visto ning n movimiento significativo ruso para abandonar georgia
5841471 los rusos dijeron que su retiro comenzar a al mediod a de hoy lunes continuaremos vigilando estrechamente las acciones rusas en georgia para confirmar su retiro
5841472 tenemos numerosas informaciones provenientes del terreno me resulta dif cil decir desde aqu d nde est el retiro de las tropas pero en cualquier caso los rusos se comprometieron a retirarse
5841473 seamos claros si se instalaron misiles despu s del 6 de agosto
5841474 vemos consolidar sus posiciones en abjazia y en osetia del sur
5841475 lamentablemente tenemos informes de ambas partes hay acusaciones de ambos lados
5841476 est claro que sobre el terreno el conflicto es espantoso
5841477 violaciones de la convenci n internacional sobre eliminaci n de todas las formas de discriminaci n racial
5841478 unas 20 personas sal an del sal n de baile del poblado y fueron rafagueadas por hombres armados que viajaban en al menos tres camionetas y que portaban armas de grueso calibre
5841479 its a unique opportunity to create a significant amount of value
5841480 we would also benefit from reducing service to some underperforming markets and discontinuing some unprofitable
5841481 fares will go up a little bit because there will be less overall competition
5841482 dont want to shoulder the burden of higher ticket prices because competition goes away
5841483 the only thing standing between joe biden and the presidency is his mouth that though is no small matter it is a himalayan barrier a sahara of a handicap a summers day in death valley a winters night at the pole either one an endless list of metaphors intended to show you both the immensity of the problem and to illustrate it with the op ed version of excess this alas is joe biden
5841484 i can understand peoples frustration by all means but we really do have the citizens at heart really want to make a difference and do it right for them
5841485 continuous improvement is the key to our future in the revenue and cost front
5841486 we have to make sure the progress that we have made thus far does not diminish our appetite and enthusiasm for driving the company to a sensible net margin
5841487 you can get confused in this business that after years and years of losses you make a little bit of money and that is enough to replenish your assets its not
5841488 in any other normal industry comparison we would have a long way to go
5841489 when you have a bitter and angry workforce that translates into a rough and tumble summer travel season
5841490 this may be an issue on which we may have a hard time finding common ground
5841491 a number of issues including those left open in the plan of reorganization will be the focus of continuing discussions between the committee and delta over the coming weeks
5841492 at the same time the committee will continue to consider potential alternatives in order to maximize the ultimate recoveries for the unsecured creditors in the delta bankruptcy
5841493 we are not going to let this transaction fail on antitrust issues
5841494 the fact of the matter is the proposal is a very labor friendly proposal
5841495 every employee will be at least as well off as they are today
5841496 id much prefer for this to be where the management team finally comes to grips with this now we understand
5841497 ive passed the threshold of believing thats going to happen anytime soon
5841498 to make it all more seamless and more like the mainline jet experience
5841499 you had to be a midget to see out the windows of the 50 seater it was so low
5841500 but if its not somebodys not going to not take northwest
5841501 as other carriers like northwest and delta and united roll out regional equipment that offers two class configurations that will turn out to be a competitive advantage for them
5841502 what people really care about is nonstop service and these aircraft are the right size to introduce them into many markets that wouldnt have it otherwise
5841503 and if apfa can put you on the bottom they do
5841504 i suspect thats one of the first orders of business coming out of bankruptcy
5841505 i think its appropriate because this is clearly a new delta but in and of themselves these things tend to be a very long term project
5841506 it is believed that the victims and suspects were patrons at the n city sports lounge
5841507 the game in question is the fortunes tower card game and all you need to do is bet the lowest amount before you deal cards 15 chips and then immediately hit the left bumper after you select
5841508 the second coming of christ will require more than softcore porn mini bar gin and viagra
5841509 but the man who comes back through the door in the wall will never be quite the same as the man who went out
5841510 there are many paths to enlightenment be sure to take the one with a heart
5841511 that i think directly answers a lot of the most nagging questions people have about organized religion spirituality and also why atheism is a healthy thing that doesnt disclude you from a genuine spiritual life
5841512 what is required is a new human order of true men and women who will live reality and never turn away
5841513 this is an important part of our efforts to achieve operational reliability
5841514 a step in the right direction toward addressing important issues affecting our pilot group
5841515 it also serves as an excellent example of the success our airline can achieve when management and employees work together
5841516 well take all the necessary actions to protect our company and contingency plans are in place
5841517 at best the strike will delay northwests ability to come out of bankruptcy and at worst it could force them into liquidation
5841518 people have been calling trying to rebook their northwest flights because of the strike
5841519 northwest has had enough labor issues in the past that they have trained people as flight attendants over the last few years
5841520 northwest has imposed terms that include drastic pay and benefit reductions drastic changes to work rules and increased work time flight attendants dont have any say in this
5841521 our first priority remains to reach an agreement with our workforce
5841522 its a huge balancing act trying to keep the public well informed and yet be respectful to the families and investigating agencies
5841523 its a heavy heavy burden and from all appearances don shouldered it very well
5841524 beyond just the money they are trying to control these people so that they will have a greater feeling for comair
5841525 my criticism has to go to the president because he is running the show
5841526 demonstrate momentum on our core agenda of continuous improvement controlling our costs optimizing our revenue and improving our customer experience
5841527 i used to be on a track team in school and thats probably why i can think to myself now yeah i can do this which is totally crazy
5841528 when i look back on my life and what im able to do its partly because of that early training
5841529 it taught me discipline how to be committed about striving to win stamina all that good stuff
5841530 its been so amazing and ive loved most of it but i think there is going to come a time where i need to live my life for myself and not in front of viewers
5841531 its not something i am going to be able to do forever obviously
5841532 on the battlefield of energy we can win for our nation a new confidence and we can seize control again of our common destiny
5841533 i am tonight setting a clear goal for the energy policy of the united states beginning this moment this nation will never use more foreign oil than we did in 1977 never
5841534 a law of acceleration definite and constant as any law of mechanics cannot be supposed to relax its energy to suit the convenience of man
5841535 you know we can do it we have the natural resources we have more oil in our shale alone than several saudi arabias we have more coal than any nation on earth we have the worlds highest level of technology we have the most skilled work force with innovative genius and i firmly believe that we have the national will to win this war

5841559 if this causes so much of an uproar in the community with so much devastation with crime and violence and we can pay so much attention to a basketball hoop and not pay so much attention to our children and our community if this is causing so many problems then perhaps our priorities are not where theyre supposed to be
5841560 basketball being played all hours of the night kids unsupervised throwing stones at cars littering urinating
5841561 if he wants to continue this program take it up to his house and his neighborhood and let him see how his neighbors feel about it when they turn his neighborhood into a circus and his neighbors cant sleep
5841562 the solution is simple a couple of blocks south of here theres a park with a basketball court he can feed the children over there they can play basketball to a reasonable hour problem solved
5841563 initially it wont represent a lot of volume but tazo is a good brand and will be a good addition to the portfolio
5841564 using the bankruptcy process the right way delta people have transformed their companys business model
5841565 our focus now is on the work still before us to emerge from chapter 11 this spring as a strong healthy and vibrant global competitor
5841566 our proposal would have provided substantially more value to deltas unsecured creditors than the delta standalone plan
5841567 the airline industry keeps growing and the dominant players are essentially weak
5841568 the samurai leader winning business battles with the wisdom honor and courage of the samurai code
5841569 what if you are given 100 million and a blank piece of paper what would you do differently thats what we are doing
5841570 i dont think it necessarily draws any direct link but it clearly will raise that thought
5841571 when the new board of directors was composed the unsecured creditors gained a much larger voice as the new shareholders of the company and part of the implicit understanding perhaps for their support in defeating the takeover bid by us airways was the future board would be open to the possibility of mergers if that appeared to be an attractive opportunity
5841572 there is no plans or intentions or previously agreed to plans to merge them
5841573 it tells me they are not being honest about delays they keep saying it was an isolated event and they had this stellar track record
5841574 id like to see that paid down as quickly as possible but if the market thinks the deal is good enough and the financiers think its good enough theyll give them the chance to do it
5841575 there have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage and no reports of incidents for any other ipod nano model
5841576 last summer i really had to take a break and see what i should do see if it was time for me to stop
5841577 we are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
5841578 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5841579 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualise and make comparisons
5841580 using the 3 d representations we are comparing the brain structures of autistic children to those of non autistic children no one has ever done that
5841581 now those people could be working side by side how do you meld happy employees with unhappy ones
5841582 us airways tends to be a more volatile stock they go up more in an up market down faster in a down market and todays a down market because of oil
5841583 if youre elbow to elbow and tied up with all those other riders going over 40 foot jumps that can be a problem the goal is to get out fast and get away from that pack
5841584 hes not the prettiest rider out there but a definite contender for the gold
5841585 she doesnt care about a couple of little potholes in the track there is no woman who will catch her unless shanaze has a catastrophic mistake
5841586 i think the bmx racers are way more serious and the jumps dont really lend themselves to style its truly about negotiating that course the fastest i think the races are going to be about 35 seconds long so theyre really just fast sprints
5841587 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words

5841592 das gesetz wirkt daher abschreckend das ist keine gute idee wenn man wie deutschland massiv auf ausl ndische investitionen angewiesen ist
5841593 es ist richtig den einstieg von staatsfonds aus bestimmten l ndern zu pr fen wenn sie ein strategisches interesse an deutschen unternehmen haben
5841594 a conversa que tivemos com o ministro direito e o presidente do tribunal foi visando exclusivamente a ordem e a tranq ilidade no processo eleitoral
5841595 its been a common misconception that the capture and handling of animals has short term effects on animals but is unlikely to have any long term effects
5841596 wed be damned sore if we were subjected to those kinds of procedures and if we had these levels of enzymes
5841597 were all mammals were all built of the same materials we function in the same way its a no brainer
5841598 theres a good chance that what youre doing may actually affect your results
5841599 on the other end of the spectrum i think theres going to be some hostility too
5841600 for some people its going to be perceived that this paper is a direct affront to their way of life and its not going to be received well i know from discussions over the past three to five years some people just dont want to hear it
5841601 in the review process there were some individuals that just didnt want it published
5841602 i thank you all for your support of our family it has been hard to deal with but life must go on
5841603 if you would like to make a donation to help our family we have set up a paypal account to do so contact for more details
5841604 i was doing it out of the kindness of my heart but i was also being deceived and i felt really stupid
5841605 we never figured on a rising sea level when building the height of the dikes
5841606 there will be a time that the tide will be so high it will overtop the dikes and nova scotia will become an island for a couple of hours
5841607 it would completely flood the only rail link to nova scotia and the main highway to nova scotia
5841608 wed have some really serious communications problems plus land loss and a tremendous loss of property
5841609 the railway is on top of the dike and it will be a major effort to lift that dike to a higher level because youd first have to build another rail line
5841610 its not something that has to be done immediately but a planned strengthening and raising of those dikes over the next 20 years is what were looking at
5841611 on a little section of dike it wouldnt take us very long to spend half a million dollars in rocks and construction and if you think of 280 kilometres of dikes that adds up fairly quickly
5841612 if tides rise quicker than our current projections indicate we may have to do it again in 30 or 40 years
5841613 the employment footprint of the industry is going to be radically different
5841614 its one of the big social issues facing atlantic canada forestry was an employer with high wages and sustained work in many of our rural communities with the loss of that base theres nothing coming to replace it
5841615 unless we successfully deal with this in a 10 15 or 20 year horizon in atlantic canada we could price ourselves out of the market compared to other jurisidictions with access to more competitive energy costs
5841616 if our costs of production are too high we will lose the firms we have it has to be addressed
5841617 as they come on line there will be the emergence of a new wave of forestry thats not only related to the commodities the two by fours and the studs but also focusing on new technologies and innovative stuff like biofuels
5841618 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5841619 big cats and dinosaurs if you see any of those give us a call
5841620 we are developing a centrally located community which will allow the ultimate builder to offer homes at prices not seen since 2001
5841621 the property is ideally located between and is easily accessible to the all the major attractions and theme parks schools healthcare shopping and public transportation the property is close to major highways yet private quiet and relatively secluded from congestion and sprawl
5841622 face it whether the press wants to admit it or not the real estate bottom has been reached and it is time to plan and build new communities the market is ready for quality affordable homes and our development site will be ideal as the market begins its long awaited rebound we have finally reached a regional six month supply of available housing which is down 1 2 from last years numbers so it is time to build and sell
5841623 urinary arsenic reflects exposures from all routes air water and food which makes it difficult to track the actual source of arsenic exposure let alone use the results from this study to establish drinking water standards
5841624 we want to capitalize on the attention to this issue and get students talking about this because it directly impacts their lives
5841625 didnt feel it appropriate to sign on to that at this point
5841626 theres still a lot of work to be done in terms of understanding the complexity of the issues
5841627 i think it will be crazy the first 10 years but once students grow up with it it will settle
5841628 the reason i think that americans do it is for rebellion and were not allowed to do this so im going to do it
5841629 binge drinking isnt fully about not being able to do it the people who do it normally have other issues like rebelling against their parents or emotional issues
5841630 it could have gotten out into traffic it could have hit someone
5841631 and you hear all the time about people jumping into cars with the keys in them and driving off
5841632 getting out of that truck was a bad idea on a lot of levels
5841633 i am looking forward to getting back playing in the spl
5841634 ive always enjoyed my spells in scotland and have usually done not too bad
5841635 the teams ive played with have always tried to play good football and motherwell are no different the spl is a great league with every week being a real test
5841636 europe is also massive for us if we win one tie well be in the group stages and could play against some massive clubs so i am really looking forward to that
5841637 motherwell to a certain extent were the surprise team last year and to finish third was a hell of an achievement
5841638 i want to come here score goals and help us get there again
5841639 we have shelters standing by to open when they are needed
5841640 we are staying on alert watching every move of this storm
5841641 chris prestaties bij deze olympische spelen zijn uitzonderlijk en hij verdient alle waardering
5841642 met wat geluk kan hij in 2014 zijn zegereeks voortzetten in een stadion dat zijn naam draagt
5841643 i think pocket change as a business will benefit dramatically from having these types of resources at hand
5841644 even some of the bigger ad networks are looking at buying anchors in their specific categories
5841645 a leading source of radical homosexual propaganda anti christian bigotry and radical transgender advocacy
5841646 i have been mocked over and over again by ungodly and unprincipled anti christian lesbians
5841647 six years in sodom from the journal of james hartline
5841648 we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5841649 we all want to conserve but we all know that conservation will not be sufficient to put us on the road to
5841650 the nation is sending 700 billion dollars every year overseas to countries that do not like us very much when i am president that is going to stop
5841651 but it is pretty clear from the policies hes advocating that hes literally over the barrel when it comes to the oil industry basically bought lock stock and barrel by the oil industry
5841652 we have to drill here and we have to drill now

5841655 glenn is at a good age and is years away from his peak
5841656 what we have got to do is prepare him for his peak get him ready to play at this level and to do well in the champions league
5841657 it would be great if we had 20million to spend but if i did glenn wouldnt be sitting here itd be rio ferdinand
5841658 but we have a certain amount of money and this gives us our chance to develop our own players and thats exciting and is good for us
5841659 speaking to him he does want to get better so it looks good for us
5841660 we have to try and get the best of what we can of raw materials and make them better
5841661 glenn likes to defend hes got good stature and good pace
5841662 we got close to him in the tournament in portugal and we realised hes vocal as well he likes to be part of the defensive unit theres plenty there to work with
5841663 ive come here and i want to play so its up to me now to do well and give the manager a problem
5841664 i spoke to a few people and they all had great stories about celtic so i only expect the best
5841665 i spoke to jan vennegoor of hesselink and also to pierre van hooijdonk and he told me a few stories about celtic i only heard great stories so i cant wait to get started
5841666 my main area is centre half and that is my best position
5841667 its a big step forward for me celtic play for medals they play in the champions league and i only see this as a big step forward in my career
5841668 what were trying to do is develop as a group here to be ready to play at any time
5841669 well have a group of centre halves a group of full backs and i do not have a set team in my mind
5841670 i have a se way of playing in my mind and whoevers face fits the bill for that week or month or year will play theres no doubt about that
5841671 we have a group that are around the same age and will be learning at the same time
5841672 in the beginning there was only rangers but in the end celtic were the club i wanted to play for and lets focus on them now
5841673 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5841674 big cats and dinosaurs if you see any of those give us a call
5841675 once he perpetrated a fraud that goes into his credibility and integrity
5841676 if you cant get rid of the skeleton in your closet youd best teach it to dance
5841677 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5841678 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5841679 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5841680 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5841681 con este baile s lo pretend a pas rmelo bien y colgar un v deo con el que cualquiera pudiera re rse y pasar un buen rato no hay ning n mensaje profundo en todo esto no pretendo nada con ello
5841682 el punto central es interconexi n lo que hemos estado viendo es que se est n dando contratos de interconexi n pero todav a vemos muchas quejas de muchos operadores tampoco tiene porqu ser gratis
5841683 la impresi n que yo tengo es que telmex ha estado interconectando lo que tenemos que checar es si esas interconexiones se est n dando en condiciones competitivas si son interconexiones que est n permitiendo jugar a los otros operadores en condiciones parejas eso hoy no lo hemos evaluado y tenemos que analizarlo con la autoridad correspondiente no esta terminado el ejercicio
5841684 si la sct dice tomo las tres condiciones de la comisi n agrego otras tres esta bien pero lo que nosotros queremos es que tomen las tres condiciones de la cofeco
5841685 we lit up your world like the fourth of july
5841686 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
5841687 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
5841688 protestamos por el hecho que se le d asilo a una persona que es terrorista
5841689 es un derecho y una obligaci n humanitaria conceder asilo a alguien que lo solicita cualquiera sea la causa
5841690 lo hemos dicho con toda claridad que de cualquier parte del mundo quien solicite un asilo a nicaragua sabe que lo tiene porque es una necesidad humanitaria
5841691 no conocemos espec ficamente c mo as la se ora lleg a presentarse y hacer la gesti n del pedido de asilo en raz n de que no hemos recibido la notificaci n de la embajada nicarag ense
5841692 tan pronto tengamos conocimiento oficial ciertamente daremos los pasos correspondientes ya que hay ciertas pr cticas que se deben cumplir y ning n pa s est exento de cumplirlas cuando se trata de un misi n diplom tica en el ecuador
5841693 el derecho de asilo en el mundo no es para terroristas
5841694 la mayor parte del da o se limit a una fuerte lluvia
5841695 calles inundadas postes de electricidad derribados y rboles ca dos ese tipo de cosas
5841696 restituir la seguridad de la poblaci n que se perdi ante los altos ndices de secuestros y asesinatos que han hecho historia en m xico
5841697 los comerciantes mayoristas hemos sido un sector especialmente golpeado por el secuestro y otros delitos graves en los ltimos a os aproximadamente 200 comerciantes o sus familiares han sido v ctimas de secuestro y varios de ellos fueron asesinados
5841698 nunca te justifiques os amigos n o precisam e os inimigos n o acreditam
5841699 if you have said something three times and nothing has changed you are talking to yourself
5841700 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5841701 targeting u s and other nato forces and afghan forces have become larger and bolder and they include direct almost conventional style attacks
5841702 in late 2006 and into 2007 there was a much greater reluctance among the taliban and other groups to carry out these conventional style attacks
5841703 they clearly believe they are winning now and its caused them to be a bit more audacious
5841704 heartfelt thanks for the sacrifice that they are making and the commitment that the french are making to help secure afghanistan
5841705 its important to remember that we are all engaged in a serious effort to bring about a stable afghanistan
5841706 france will continue to assume its responsibilities in favor of a democratic and peaceful afghanistan and in the fight against terrorism
5841707 i wanted them to have a better opportunity than me

5841721 en la otan tratan de convertir a los agresores en v ctimas de blanquear al r gimen georgiano
5841722 rusia no ocupa ning n pa s y no tiene intenciones de ocupar nada
5841723 la retirada se har a medida que las fuerzas georgianas regresen efectivamente a sus bases permanentes y que se refuercen las posiciones de las fuerzas de mantenimiento de la paz pienso que llevar tres o cuatro d as
5841724 if he picks ridge the convention blows up you will have a base completely demoralized and it will be viewed that he is ceding the future of the gop to a liberal republican it would be a disaster
5841725 en puebla en tal lado est aconteciendo un hecho muy lamentable
5841726 yo no le creo a madrazo t le crees a madrazo
5841727 this girl eats fried cheesecake whenever she wants this girl doesnt
5841728 but i gotta tell ya thats the girl who lives in my heart
5841729 en nuestro estadio ellos van a estar un poquito m s atr s y esperando esa contra que a ellos les gusta pero esperamos que en el bernab u y con nuestra gente nos metamos en plena temporada
5841730 estamos en pretemporada y faltan muchas cosas pero en el partido de ida le hemos dado al equipo contrario lo que ellos quer an porque sus principales virtudes son el robo del bal n y la contra y nosotros hemos perdido muchas pelotas en zona peligrosa y ellos tienen gente de calidad
5841731 las cosas hay que valorarlas fr amente y no valorarlo s lo por un partido porque el madrid siempre que pierde un partido se dicen muchas cosas pero hay que tomarse estas situaciones con tranquilidad porque si ganamos la supercopa en casa van a decir que no necesitamos fichajes
5841732 supongo que el entrenador y el apartado t cnico del club han analizado esta situaci n hace mucho tiempo por lo que va a ser la temporada y lo que nos va a exigir
5841733 son diez a os aqu pero lo que tengo claro es que esta temporada quiero que sea diferente a la anterior no por minutos jugados sino por mis sensaciones no estuve contento con mi a o pasado no me qued bien despu s de la lesi n y no estuve a la altura de lo que he dado siempre
5841734 este a o he afrontado de otra manera esta pretemporada y lo nico que quiero es que el mister sepa que me tiene de verdad para afronta una temporada dura y que estoy al cien por cien por y para el equipo
5841735 seguir jugando mientras siga disfrutando del f tbol y cuando vea que soy prescindible en ese momento igual har otra cosa el real madrid te exige mucho
5841736 seria un error centrarnos s lo en la d cima al final lo que te juegas cada domingo es la liga la champions es muy bonita pero la puedes ganar o no y es muy complicado y depende m s de c mo est s en marzo sin embargo la liga es al d a y si te centras en europa puede ser que te quedes sin nada
5841737 no lo veo tan mal y creo que se va a quedar con nosotros ya hab a dicho que tiene mucho m s para darle al madrid y es uno de los jugadores que marca la diferencia
5841738 yo lo he vivido y siempre es mucho m s exigente tener que estar al m ximo nivel y al cien por cien en tu equipo y tu selecci n y m s cuando se trata de espa a u holanda
5841739 si no vas convocado sabes que cada mes tienes una semana m s tranquila como esta y un par de d as de descanso con una edad como la de ruud y con todo lo que ha jugado creo que es un alivio y a nivel de equipo nos vendr muy bien
5841740 lo veo muy bien aqu tiene muchos holandeses y eso facilita su adaptaci n todo son gente muy buena y fiable para un vestuario rafael se ha adaptado r pido y estamos muy contentos con l
5841741 estoy contento por l porque yo he tenido la suerte de estar con pep en la selecci n fue un pedazo de jugador de los que m s clase han tenido en la selecci n y por c mo ve el f tbol creo que es el entrenador perfecto para el barcelona
5841742 tambi n es importante rese ar todo lo que l ha significado para el barcelonismo hacerte una idea de un equipo por la pretemporada no es una visi n real para ejemplo nosotros que el a o pasado hicimos una mala pretemporada y despu s estuvimos muy bien en la liga
5841743 vicente es un hombre al que tenemos mucho cari o le deseo todo lo mejor no creo que cambie mucho porque lo que se ha hecho est muy bien y aunque cada entrenador tiene sus gustos l ha dicho que cuando uno gana no puede cambiar s lo continuar
5841744 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
5841745 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
5841746 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5841747 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5841748 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5841749 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5841750 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5841751 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5841752 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5841753 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
5841754 i just reviewed this dog of a manuscript for the journal of
5841755 flame amp citron ole christian madsen i love this danish director thats all i know
5841756 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
5841757 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
5841758 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
5841759 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
5841760 the presumptive democratic presidential nominee will announce his running mate
5841761 serene self confidence even arrogance would likely add a necessary dash of bareknuckle candor to obamas high road bid
5841762 by selecting the pro choice ridge as his running mate mccain would a appeal to moderate swing voters b extend an olive branch to pro choice former clintonistas dissatisfied with obama c reinforce his perceived edge over the democratic nominee in the experience and foreign policy departments and d have a shot at competing in pennsylvania
5841763 while we continue to believe bobs stores has great potential and an excellent organization our decision to sell the business reflects our vision to grow tjx people as a global off price company
5841764 we believe that focusing on the significant opportunities to expand the domestic and international presence of our core off price concepts is the right strategy for us at this time
5841765 pay any price bear any burden in the defense of liberty
5841766 it will never contribute more than a fraction of our needs
5841767 generates about 240 billion in annual revenues and employs a quarter million germans germanys wind industry created 8 000 jobs in 2007 alone and one recent study suggested that the renewable sector could provide more work than the auto industry currently the nations biggest employer by 2020
5841768 has a habit of straying off message and making impolitic comments
5841769 pretty deep knowledge of pretty much every big foreign policy question
5841770 obama has shown himself more not less in need of an attack dog able to engage mccain on national security
5841771 e vents in georgia and pakistan have made the prospect that obama will choose
5841772 if obama wanted to make a truly big statement before the convention he might want to risk alienating democrats by picking a republican running mate
5841773 than by choosing a member of the other to be his running mate
5841774 fill the bill of the excitement of the newcomer on the national stage
5841775 p ick a running mate who is a conservative white guy or a general or a republican
5841776 obama is likely to choose someone relatively safe and avoid taking a chance with a game changing selection
5841777 someone who would fill perceived holes in his r sum
5841778 who would reinforce his promise of change or one who might help him win a contested state
5841779 bidens son is a lawyer who would be nowhere near the front lines
5841780 for mccains son it was either the army or jail thats why mccain rarely mentions he son in iraq
5841781 a lot of companies are unaware of where their catalogue paper comes from
5841782 we want to work with them and pressure them to do the right thing by adopting sustainable policies
5841783 at first they werent responsive but then they saw how it would benefit them
5841784 consumer opinion has a lot of power to influence companies
5841785 we continue to work within the supply chain to promote certification of forests and fibre and we are engaged with our suppliers to continuously improve on our prudent use of natural resources
5841786 sears has yet to make any policy changes so well continue to lobby them
5841787 well no but you have to ask yourself what it means
5841788 president elect mccain will be making a very big mistake by appointing joe leiberman as his vp
5841789 you ever notice how anyone who stands between them and power is an evil idiot bent on the destruction of the world funny how that works
5841790 actually the far right often accuses chavez not only of wanting to take over south america but often insinuate that hes working with iran to install nukes the far right often accuses syria of attacking us interests granted considering israel is our 51st state thats not unexpected as for mugabe the far right has been rather silent i guess its more important to pretend that were all georgians than to take an actual stand on mugabes horrific abuses
5841791 tell me what it is this isnt about t boone pickens it isnt about democrats and republicans this ones about america
5841792 participants also reported problems navigating within the web site and locating information
5841793 suffice is to say that more research is probably needed to assess the usability of the site and should be performed by people who have a basic understanding of the size and complexity of the program

5841795 indeed the site averages more than a million hits a day

5841810 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him our prayers are with his family during this time
5841811 he was a long time friend of mine a caring compassionate individual with strong convictions who worked hard every day
5841812 its just senseless senseless he meant a lot to me and i talked to him and visited with him as late as thursday he was a visionary always looking forward a great guy i cant say enough about him he was a dear friend
5841813 honey you were in such good health i wouldnt have done it if youd been sick
5841814 youre only here for a short visit dont hurry dont worry and be sure to smell the flowers along the way
5841815 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
5841816 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
5841817 cooking with biofuels such as wood dung and crop residue
5841818 open biomass burning associated with deforestation and crop residue burning
5841819 soot and other forms of black carbon could have as much as 60 percent of the current our italics global warming effect of carbon dioxide

5841823 the judge today correctly found that it was unlikely that the cfaa would apply to security researchers giving an academic talk
5841824 a presentation at a security conference is not some sort of computer intrusion its protected speech and vital to the free flow of information about computer security vulnerabilities silencing researchers does not improve security the vulnerability was there before the students discovered it and would remain in place regardless of whether the students publicly discussed it or not
5841825 the only thing keeping the students and the mbta from working together cooperatively to resolve the fare payment card security issues is the lawsuit itself

5841833 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election

5841837 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote

5841845 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past

5841847 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
5841848 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5841849 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5841850 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety

5841862 free us from our addiction to oil from 4 00 plus per gallon gas
5841863 there is no time to waste we want a better future we demand a better future we the american people are no longer asking
5841864 the free us ad takes a different tone than our previous efforts
5841865 this ad issues a direct and compelling challenge and juxtaposes the stark imagery of our addiction to fossil fuels with the earnest faces of the american people who are calling for answers and solutions now it takes the call for renewable energy from a request to a demand
5841866 the conventions are about coming together to choose the ideas and the people who will lead us forward
5841867 the next american president has the inescapable responsibility to move our country away from fossil fuels and toward clean sustainable energy sources our economic and environmental futures depend on it and the american people are demanding it

5841870 many asian brands were grown from copy cat economics using western benchmarks and paradigms most asian brands were driven by a 3 fold strategy copy that make them cheaply and make alot of it eventhough this may be fundamentally sustainable in the coming 20 to 30 years asian brands must transition from being centres of imitation to centres of creation to succeed otherwise there will be little economic sustainability in the long run
5841871 that means having the courage to step outside ones comfort zone and go against the grain
5841872 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5841873 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons

5841884 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5841885 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party
5841886 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich

5841888 im pretty much a dyed in the wool republican and i was a marine what he went through for five years you gotta hand that to him
5841889 i mean come on whoever buys into that they gotta have a screw loose
5841890 just stay in the senate stay busy learn more foreign policy and come back in ten years obama and i betcha id vote for you
5841891 hes as genuine as can be its just hes a green apple hanging on the tree and mccain is a ripe red apple ready to be picked obama just needs to ripen some more
5841892 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got
5841893 thats christian identity politics and im sure it has some influence but i dont think at the end of the day its the deciding factor
5841894 jimmy carter could have come in here and sounded much more comfortable with his faith but people having seen a jimmy carter presidency would not vote for him just because theyre likely to see him in heaven
5841895 study all the different candidates at every different level you need to register to vote and then you need to vote
5841896 when i hear people say i dont like either of the candidates im just not going to vote i want to say to them well then you need to move to another country because people died for that vote

5842002 the drive bys limbaughs term for the members of the mainstream press are just hoping for this they are just hoping for it because they know its not just a few loud mouths in the base they know the base will totally turn on mccain if this is the case its about trying to persuade mccain to make a decision that will ensure his defeat

5842064 the sports fan in me loves watching the u s vs greece in mens basketball qualifying but the pedophile in me loves watching 16 year old girls run around in one sies

5842068 absolutely im just sad its basically over at least shawn johnson is only 16 so shell compete in 2012 in london
5842069 until then you can find her residing comfortably in spank banks across the nation
5842070 true then again she lives in iowa which isnt that far from here perhaps a facebook relationship could flourish between her and i ill move there right now
5842071 mommy im going to be four and im going to graduate to olive garden
5842072 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
5842073 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
5842074 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
5842075 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
5842076 she was a stray but she worked her way up

5842083 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5842084 targeting u s and other nato forces and afghan forces have become larger and bolder and they include direct almost conventional style attacks
5842085 in late 2006 and into 2007 there was a much greater reluctance among the taliban and other groups to carry out these conventional style attacks
5842086 they clearly believe they are winning now and its caused them to be a bit more audacious
5842087 heartfelt thanks for the sacrifice that they are making and the commitment that the french are making to help secure afghanistan
5842088 its important to remember that we are all engaged in a serious effort to bring about a stable afghanistan
5842089 france will continue to assume its responsibilities in favor of a democratic and peaceful afghanistan and in the fight against terrorism
5842090 as long as they have our money theyre going to play with it

5842098 barack obama is going to have to win this thing or lose this thing on his own
5842099 we analysts have had to pretend to know what they are thinking
5842100 and so weve had to get by without really knowing what were talking about
5842101 so am i loading my stuff into a uhaul or putting it all back
5842102 this is god today i will be handling all of your problems for you i do not need your help so have a nice day i love you

5842107 most americans still dont know as marshall writes that on the campaign trail mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused most americans still dont know it is precisely for this reason that the mccain campaign has now shut down the presss previously unfettered access to the candidate on the straight talk express

5842112 sherry joness book is a work of fiction ron evanss book is not and it contains a very large number of provable lies and complete absurdities which were defamatory not just about me but my sons mother elizabeth west the metropolitan police and people including john major and norman tebbit

5842117 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5842118 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5842119 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5842120 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5842121 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5842122 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5842123 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
5842124 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
5842125 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
5842126 to ensure our national security economic prosperity and clean environment by breaking our dependence on foreign oil
5842127 the hands that install roofs can also install solar panels the hands that build todays cars can also build the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles barack obama will create 5 million jobs developing homegrown energy technologies
5842128 one of the most important ways of positioning on global warming is to emphasize the jobs issue since it appeals to people who you might not otherwise reach with your message
5842129 on the big issues that our nation faces some sacrifice will be required not only from you individually but from the nation as a whole there is no magic bullet to our energy problems for example no perfect energy source
5842130 the call to sacrifice for the nations greater good remains an imperative of citizenship sadly in recent years in the midst of a war on two fronts this call to service never came after 9 11 we were asked to shop
5842131 plenty of recent media polls demonstrate that drilling for more american oil particularly offshore drilling has the potential to be a very effective wedge issue for republicans as a way to reduce the price of gas
5842132 for the immediate short term right now forcing house democrats to vote on drilling offshore and in wilderness areas or exposing their refusal to hold this vote would be a potentially strong wedge issue that would split the democrats win among independents and excite the republicans
5842133 the republican echo chamber has done a great job on this
5842134 this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very future of our nation
5842135 the energy crisis is real it is worldwide it is a clear and present danger to our nation these are the facts and we must face them
5842136 thou shalt not talk honestly to the american people about sacrifice
5842137 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5842138 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5842139 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5842140 how long do you take to write a blog post
5842141 the uab discussion book project promotes civic involvement respectful dialogue about often controversial issues and more knowledgeable participation in a global society
5842142 field notes from a catastrophe man nature and climate change
5842143 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5842144 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5842145 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5842146 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5842147 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5842148 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5842149 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5842150 for eight years weve had a vice president who stayed in undisclosed locations trust me its already change we can believe in its just the next vice presidents identity thats undisclosed
5842151 the institutional culture of corruption embraced by the clinton leadership of the democratic party
5842152 unaccountable power for the clintons at the expense of the rule of law and respect for the constitutional processes of government
5842153 especially since it was days after she said she wouldnt take any more money from me
5842154 sen obama needs someone experienced in foreign policy and or running a state or corporation joe biden would be good
5842155 she has the perfect place for a republican platform the washingtonpost com
5842156 if sen barack obama should choose hillary clinton i will stay home on election day and i am not alone
5842157 theyre definitely a one of a kind item in the world
5842158 back in those days you didnt have machine tools and everything was hand carved and a great of amount of detail went into the making of these chairs
5842159 our early start means were not facing the same compliance costs others in the sector are facing under the national greenhouse and energy reporting act
5842160 instead were focusing on the commercial opportunities for us rather than dealing with the compliance costs
5842161 were well positioned to make money from carbon markets which is simply an extension of our energy trading business
5842162 we have a solid understanding of the market and how to help our customers
5842163 the train has left the station on this and there will be severe repercussions for those who fail to see the inevitable coming
5842164 no one says its easy but carbon will have to be managed as just another business issue
5842165 we understood what it meant to measure our carbon footprint it was extremely difficult to get landlords to change their behaviour
5842166 we ended up spending the money ourselves to install sensors in offices change our light bulbs and employ our own cleaners so we could recycle
5842167 it was also a challenge convincing suppliers that we were serious about the carbon impact of production processes in our purchasing decisions
5842168 we made a conscious decision to pay more for more efficiently produced consumables and to include the long term carbon impact in equipment running costs
5842169 tnt has the largest fleet of diesel electric vehicles in australia we bought the whole production line from japan of 10 vehicles last year but we have 1500 trucks in our fleet
5842170 so its going to be some time before our suppliers can produce enough trucks to satisfy the demand
5842171 fully identifies with liberation theology and plans to implement it in his government the preferential option for the poor
5842172 important that policies be adopted to make citizens aware of the importance of conservation in order to protect the environment
5842173 we will take some new measures to ensure that air quality will reach a new level after the olympic games
5842174 whether it is automobile emissions reduction or construction site dust reduction or coal pollution reduction i believe that the requirements will be more stringent
5842175 el que pregunta con mala intenci n no merece conocer la verdad
5842176 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
5842177 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
5842178 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
5842179 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
5842180 the amethyst initiative is not about lowering the drinking age
5842181 we need serious sustained unfettered debate about the drinking age and the reality of life on a college campus and how these two things are aligned i signed the statement in hopes that it would encourage debate on our campus about the seriousness of drinking in general but more importantly the high risk drinking that has become so common on college campuses today as an educator i feel a responsibility to encourage a discussion about responsibility that responsibility rests with not only the students but with those of us who work to provide for their education safety and well being we must engage in civil informed and dispassionate debate and consider all policy alternatives no matter how controversial

5842188 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5842189 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5842190 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5842191 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5842192 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5842193 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
5842194 people used to genuinely fear that they would lose their jobs if they were outed and many did
5842195 if you were found out it was absolutely the end
5842196 the trick is to present the business case to corporate employers
5842197 it simply doesnt make good business sense to have a reputation for being a workplace that is not open to gay and lesbian employers
5842198 no se puede hablar de recesi n pero si de desaceleraci n
5842199 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5842200 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5842201 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5842202 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5842203 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5842204 men it has been well said think in herds it will be seen that they go mad in herds while they only recover their senses slowly and one by one
5842205 its almost like i dont know i dont want to say its just really hard
5842206 at the 320 mark my right hamstring grabbed me and i just couldnt move it anymore
5842207 ive never had anything like that happen i was totally out of control on the straightaway i was all over the lane and christine ohuruogu was just really strong coming home
5842208 i dont want to tell you what im thinking right now because its not positive
5842209 i feel so betrayed by my body once again and its such a tough break for me
5842210 i crossed the line and it was very hard for me to pick myself back up
5842211 it took about 30 seconds todays hard tomorrows going to be harder but what can you do but try again
5842212 if i ran 9 6 shutting it down i wouldnt be nervous at all either
5842213 the ou initiative is the only major u s initiative of its kind devoted to the problem of biodeterioration and biocorrosion
5842214 first we have to understand how mother nature cleans up these spills and we can do this by studying the way microorganisms interact with hydrocarbons
5842215 we want to better understand how organisms eat through these pipelines several fundamental mechanisms cause this problem but it is spotty and doesnt occur all of a sudden rather biocorrosion occurs over a long period of time and we are using a series of new molecular and chemical tools to find out why and how this happens
5842216 we think cells grow in communities that adhere to the inner surface of pipelines and form three dimensional biofilms that can sometimes cause pitting once we understand what these microorganisms are doing we can interrupt their processes or diagnose them more effectively the science is rudimentary at this stage the modern tools of molecular microbiology have not been applied yet but a national science foundation grant support from the does joint genome institute and the cooperation of the energy industry allowed us to study pipeline biocorrosion on the north slope
5842217 for many years no one ever thought anaerobes could grow by metabolizing hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen but that is simply wrong the organisms are actually quite good at it the underlying mechanisms will be even more important as we introduce newer biofuels to augment our fossil fuel supply we are putting new fuel combinations into the existing pipelines that service the entire country the new biofuels can be less stable so there is a different problem to deal with the chemistry of biofuels may not allow us to store them as long and more research is needed to determine the stability compatability and composition of such fuel mixtures
5842218 because two thirds of u s oil is still in place we can use these organisms to convert residual hydrocarbons into natural gas and create a new source of domestic energy the concept of anaerobic metabolism is an innovative process and the ou initiative is the only one of its kind in the united states at the present time we are also experimenting with shales and other unconventional reservoirs
5842219 biotechnology can influence recovery and address some of todays problems if we can understand how microorganisms degrade hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen ou is one of the top universities in the world to study anaerobic microbiology with 14 experts performing research in some aspect of this field it is rare for universities to have even a single individual with this specialization ou is an exciting place to be if you are an environmental microbiologist this initiative has unified this group of experts and led to the groundbreaking research we have just begun to understand
5842220 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke
5842221 the worry is if you are exposed to this cadmium through other sources you can also be at risk for emphysema
5842222 the big picture is we keep learning more about the contributions of environmental toxins to the chronic diseases of aging for which we never suspected an environmental cause
5842223 with a larger population we will be able to better disentangle the independent effects of cadmium and smoking and whether dietary cadmium or other non cigarette sources may also influence lung function
5842224 association between 24 hour urinary cadmium and pulmonary function among community exposed men the va normative aging study
5842225 this is the first time that a study provides evidence that in the human brain dopamine is involved in the adaptations that result from sleep deprivation
5842226 these findings suggest dopamine may increase after sleep deprivation as a compensatory response to the effects of increased sleep drive in the brain
5842227 the extent to which this occurs may differentiate how vulnerable people are to the neurobehavioral effects of sleep loss
5842228 however the concurrent decline in cognitive performance which is associated with the dopamine increases suggests that the adaptation is not sufficient to overcome the cognitive deterioration induced by sleep deprivation and may even contribute to it
5842229 we are not going to speak about fannie and freddie

5842237 democracy cannot be a permanent form of government and it is often followed by a tyranny because it leads from a republican prosperity to egoism from egoism to complacency from complacency to mediocrity from mediocrity to apathy from apathy to dependence upon the state and from dependence upon the state to tyranny
5842238 democracy the rule of the masses legitimacy is acquired through meetings or other forms of direct expression of public will it leads to mob rule the relation to the property rights is as under communism no respect of property rights the relation to legislation the will of the majority regulates all spheres of public life no matter whether it is based on through study of the issue or on desire prejudice or impulse leads to demagoguery double standards public dissatisfaction instability and anarchy
5842239 democracy does not exist for a long time it wastes exhausts and destroys itself there was never a democracy that didnt kill itself
5842240 the american form of government is the republic the true freedom does not exist either under despotism or excesses of democracy
5842241 democracy always leads to conflicts and instability but never provides for the security of the citizens or their property usually it is very short at life and very bloody at death
5842242 between republic and democracy there is the same difference as between order and chaos
5842243 democracy is the rule of mobs tempted by newspaper editors
5842244 democracy its the rule of the wishes of the mob or to be exact ambitions and vices of its leaders
5842245 i have been always sure that democracy sooner or late will destroy freedom or civilization or both
5842246 democracy its the tyranny of majority or more exact the majority party which through fraud or cohesion is manipulating the electoral process
5842247 the peoples that accept democracy yield its deadly fruits enormous growth of public expenses wars inspired by the wishes of the mob and not by intellect unfavorable conditions of peace threatening national interests and national sovereignty lower housing prices and fewer civil rights people grow tired of democratic politicians replacing statesmen
5842248 the acceptance of democracy by all european nations is deadly for the proper governorship freedom law order respect of authority and religion and at the end will lead to chaos out of which will appear the worldwide tyranny

5842250 iraqi shiite assassination teams are being trained in at least four locations in iran by tehrans elite quds force and lebanese hezbollah
5842251 and are planning to return to iraq in the next few months to kill specific iraqi officials as well as u s and iraqi troops according to intelligence gleaned from captured militia fighters and other sources in iraq
5842252 provided iraqs national security adviser with several lists of the assassination teams expected targets
5842253 said the targets include many judges but would not otherwise identify them
5842254 iraqs intelligence service is preparing operations to determine where and when the special group fighters will enter the country and is to provide an assessment to prime minister nouri al maliki
5842255 are expected to return to iraq between now and october

5842263 initial tests have shown that network load could be reduced by a factor of five or more without compromising network performance
5842264 at the same time speeds are increased by about 20 percent

5842309 our findings suggest that low levels of exposure to inorganic arsenic may play a role in diabetes
5842310 while prospective studies are needed to establish whether this association is causal these findings add to the existing concerns about the long term health consequences of low and moderate exposure to inorganic arsenic

5842316 the intent is to put the pastor not a committee in a position of responsibility and authority for the congregation to pursue a new vision for mission and ministry
5842317 for when our savior christ says tell it to the church he by these words commands the church to be the supreme judge from this it follows that not only one state namely that of the bishops but also other pious and learned persons from all states are to be appointed as judges and have decisive votes
5842318 this is to be understood in the sense not only that the church has the power to excommunicate impenitent sinners but also that the congregation has the supreme authority in all church matters such as reproof church discipline divisions judging doctrine and appointing pastors to mention only these things

5842321 vap is a relatively common infection and increasingly one caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria
5842322 there have been many attempts to prevent vap most of which have revolved around modifying hospital practices the silver coated endotracheal tube has an advantage in that it doesnt require any additional effort by nurses therapists and doctors who may already be over burdened
5842323 i think this is just the beginning for this kind of technology
5842324 the silver polymer coating will most likely be applied also to tracheostomy tubes and also become available for use in pediatric medicine in the future we could see other types of coatings with other functions placed on devices that come into contact with the body

5842331 prevention strategies often focus on modifiable risk factors for colonization and aspiration and can successfully reduce ventilator associated pneumonia rates but no single strategy completely eliminates ventilator associated pneumonia
5842332 adherence to prevention guidelines is variable due to costs and lack of education resources and leadership
5842333 in conclusion the results of this large randomized multicenter study demonstrated that the silver coated endotracheal tube significantly reduced the incidence of microbiologically confirmed ventilator associated pneumonia and had its greatest benefit during the peak time of ventilator associated pneumonia occurrence without any notable adverse events
5842334 the silver coated endotracheal tube appears to offer a unique approach because it is the first intervention that becomes user dependent after intubation requiring no further action by the clinician
5842335 based on the results of this trial should clinicians reconsider guidelines for ventilator associated pneumonia prevention and use a silver coated endotracheal tube in all patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation in the icu
5842336 the answer is probably yes for the subset of patients at very high risk of developing early onset ventilator associated pneumonia such as neurologically impaired patients or trauma patients because the greatest effect of the intervention appeared to occur during the first 10 days of mechanical ventilation and was clinically relevant with minimal effect on clinician workload
5842337 important uncertainties exist regarding the exact benefit of silver coated endotracheal tubes
5842338 consequently silver coated tubes should not be viewed as the definitive answer for ventilator associated pneumonia prevention and until additional data confirm the clinical effectiveness and cost benefit of these devices their issue should be restricted to high risk patients treated in icus with benchmark value based infection rates that remain above institutional goals despite implementation of a comprehensive strategy of usual preventive measures to prevent ventilator associated pneumonia
5842339 developing strategies to improve the prediction and diagnoses of dementia has paramount therapeutic and public health implications
5842340 when neuropsychological tests are used for diagnostic purposes an individuals level of performance on specific tests is measured against healthy normative samples to determine cognitive impairment however this approach does not take into account intra individual variability in cognitive function
5842341 of the 897 participants there were 61 cases of incident dementia 6 8 percent identified during the follow up period mean average 3 3 years
5842342 on the basis of the consensus clinical diagnostic procedures 47 participants developed incident dementia of the alzheimer type and 18 participants developed incident vascular dementia during the study 128 individuals died as expected for the age of this cohort of these 18 had developed incident dementia
5842343 in summary within person across neuropsychological test variability was associated with development of dementia independently of performance of the neuropsychological tests this finding needs to be replicated in different populations before it is applied in a clinical setting

5842350 observational studies have demonstrated that the concentration of total homocysteine in blood is associated with risk of coronary artery disease and stroke
5842351 to evaluate the effects of homocysteine lowering treatment with folic acid plus vitamin b12 on mortality and cardiovascular events
5842352 mean average plasma total homocysteine concentration was reduced by 30 percent after 1 year of treatment in the groups receiving folic acid and vitamin b12
5842353 during a median midpoint 38 months of follow up the primary end point was experienced by a total of 422 participants 13 7 percent 219 participants 14 2 percent receiving folic acid vitamin b12 vs 203 13 1 percent not receiving such treatment and 200 participants 13 0 percent receiving vitamin b6 vs 222 14 3 percent not receiving vitamin b6
5842354 we could not detect any preventive effect of intervention with folic acid plus vitamin b12 or with vitamin b6 on mortality or major cardiovascular events among patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing intensive conventional treatment we found a numerically lower incidence of stroke and higher incidence of cancer in the groups receiving folic acid but these observations were not statistically significant
5842355 our findings do not support the use of b vitamins as secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease
5842356 the potential role of arsenic in diabetes development is supported by experimental and mechanistic evidence
5842357 from a public health perspective confirmation of a role for arsenic in diabetes development would add to the concerns posed by the carcinogenic cardiovascular developmental and reproductive effects of inorganic arsenic in drinking water and could substantially modify risk assessment and risk benefit analyses estimating the consequences of arsenic exposure
5842358 given widespread exposure to inorganic arsenic from drinking water worldwide elucidating the contribution of arsenic to the diabetes epidemic is a public health research priority with potential implications for the prevention and control of diabetes
5842359 stemming the pandemic of type 2 diabetes is a public health priority and will require a multifaceted approach
5842360 this must include improving the understanding of the etiology of diabetes and identifying modifiable factors that can be incorporated into prevention strategies
5842361 to date this approach has focused on medication and lifestyle modification but the role of environmental exposures must also be considered
5842362 while many questions remain about the role of arsenic in diabetogenesis they can only be answered by additional research
5842363 in the meantime arsenic exposure from drinking water is a widespread environmental pollutant that affects millions of individuals around the world
5842364 it is prudent to minimize arsenic exposure while its effect on metabolic diseases continues to be researched

5842429 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5842430 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5842431 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5842432 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5842433 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5842434 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain

5842445 we live in a competitive world and that is a fact that cannot be reversed
5842446 we need to invest in the research and innovation necessary to create jobs and industries of the future right here in the us
5842447 and one place where that investment would make an enormous difference is in a renewable energy policy that ends our addiction on foreign oil provides real long term relief from high gas prices and high fuel costs and builds a green economy that could create up to five million well paying jobs that cant be outsourced
5842448 can also create millions of new jobs by rebuilding our schools roads bridges and other critical infrastructure that needs repair
5842449 this nation has faced such fundamental change before and each time weve kept our economy strong and competitive by making the decision to expand opportunity outward to grow our middle class to invest in innovation and most importantly to invest in the education and well being of our workers

5842452 the destruction of the islamic khilafah state over 80 years ago marked the beginning of dividing the muslim world into countless nation states governed by a plethora of kings dictators and western backed democrats today three major regions of the muslim world are under occupation palestine iraq and afghanistan oil and food crisis has pushed millions of people into starvation sectarian divisions are fuelled by occupying powers to further divide and weaken us the muslim ummah now needs a new political thinking and direction it requires a new leadership that will unify the umma and utilize her resources to address these countless problems this one day conference will address the obligation of unifying our umma under one leadership and discuss how political unity is the only practical way forward for the muslim ummah
5842453 how can it be that we have allowed our lands iraq afghanistan palestine kashmir chechnya our people our resources our wealth and our very dignity to be eaten up and destroyed by the enemies of islam when we have such great potential among us if only we unite as one umma

5842471 this is a terribly vague number and is a dangerously recorded number that is not representing what is actually happening
5842472 proven time and time again that he is part of our future here
5842473 i had him the whole game that breaking ball was up
5842474 well with kent up there i went 2 0 and i was overthrowing a lot randy came out and settled me down
5842475 he told me just to back off a little bit just hit my spots that whole inning i was all over the place i was trying to throw too hard and just got away from what i was doing the whole game
5842476 he had very good command of his pitches early in the game
5842477 whenever he got in trouble he made the pitch to get the double play or the outs they hit him but not that hard im proud of the young man he continues to go out there nothing bothers him about our lack of scoring runs for him
5842478 well im not an overpowering pitcher ive got to go out there and hit my spots thats what ive been doing all year so i cant just go out there and do too much i learned that when i went back out there in the seventh i didnt do too much got a couple ground balls and got the team back in the dugout
5842479 i see him as a middle of the order guy who in the future can hit 25 home runs and drive in 100 runs
5842480 i still know i have a lot left in the tank and look forward to playing against the nationals
5842481 they put me in a position where i still have to earn it

5842483 the way willie is playing right now it will be very tough to get him out of the lineup
5842484 i dont know whats going on truly i dont know
5842485 i understand what the team needs but i look at it like theyre going with youth i feel like i can catch and im not in the works at catcher here anymore
5842486 manny has done a good job of trying to get me at bats but i still feel like im a catcher whether that happens who knows
5842487 it has to be the right situation i want to go to a team where im going to be a part of that team not just go somewhere and suck up a ring i want to be part of a ring if i get that chance
5842488 pitched well enough to get three wins today i think
5842489 i felt like i could throw whatever johnny estrada called i only shook him off once
5842490 well you know the comeback of kearns whos been swinging the bat real good and the way willie harris has swung the bat its been a lift for us and now having zimmerman hopefully we can add up a couple of those guys

5842559 boys have trouble reading because they dont get to read for a purpose that makes any sense to them
5842560 as a society we need to make more of an effort to connect boys with many different kinds of reading both at home and at school
5842561 if we can expand the notion of what reading is well have a better chance of inspiring boys to want to be readers this means broadening our definition of reading to include boy friendly nonfiction humor sports comics graphic novels action adventure magazines websites and newspapers boys need to know that these materials count as reading
5842562 we can help boys become readers by giving them a reason to want to become readers
5842563 this approach opens the door and the mind once a boy starts reading he will be more receptive to many other types of reading over his lifetime

5842615 in what remains a difficult environment for the home furnishings industry due to significant macroeconomic pressures we continue to be diligent in improving the efficiencies of our operations although our fiscal first quarter is historically our weakest we strengthened our operating performance during the period and expanded our margins on a 6 6 decline in sales while we anticipate it being some time before we see an across the board industry improvement we believe our balance sheet and the strength of our business model will carry us through this period
5842616 with the cellular conversion at our la z boy manufacturing facilities complete we are realizing the anticipated efficiencies throughout our production process in addition to the overall decline in volume the furniture industry including la z boy typically takes a one week plant shutdown for vacation in july which hampers the ability to absorb fixed overhead costs comparable to other quarters
5842617 our casegoods business continues to face significant challenges in this environment with bedroom and dining room group purchases typically higher ticket transactions than upholstered furniture it is apparent the consumer is postponing these purchases to a greater extent than they are other furniture categories our team remains committed to running the business with a cost structure aligned with the current lower volume environment and is focused on expanding its distribution to other channels
5842618 on a decline in sales our operating loss was flat against last year as we improved our gross margin in the segment with the costs of consolidating our warehouse and it systems behind us we have the ability to operate more efficiently throughout the year although we remain concerned about weaker consumer discretionary spending impacting our volume we continue to examine all aspects of the segments cost structure and are focused on improving its performance
5842619 the overall macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging increased oil prices higher interest rates and a depressed housing market combined with low consumer confidence levels are having an effect on the home furnishings industry across the board we remain committed to running our business with the greatest efficiency possible and believe we have the opportunity to improve our performance as we announced last quarter due to seasonality issues and the way in which our fiscal year may through april rolls out we anticipate the second half of our fiscal year to be operationally stronger than the first half

5842651 two weeks before i came here i had an operation for a tumor
5842652 i could only ride in walk when i arrived in hong kong and lancet was brilliant usually hes difficult when you are getting on and off him but he seemed to know i wasnt well and he just stood there for me for a change
5842653 i had lots of help with my horse people kept saying we believe in you you can do it but it took a huge effort from the team and a lot of physiotherapy and work in the gym to get me going again
5842654 everyone was so positive and so kind im really proud of my horse and proud of my friends when you are sick you find out who your real friends are and many of my rivals turned into my best friends
5842655 i hadnt forgotten what happened the other day but if i wanted to win i had to take the risk
5842656 my horse is outstanding and my feelings for him dont change because of the mistakes he made i just have to work to get his confidence back again
5842657 i really like to ride to music and after i heard isabells score i knew i needed to do a good test but without risks

5842659 in athens i had nothing to lose so i was more relaxed but this time i felt i have to have the gold medal to keep up the standard and in the grand prix salinero was tense
5842660 in the special i tried more and then isabell had her mistake but today i was more relaxed i decided to do as good as i can and i tried to stay calm during the warm up i decided that if i didnt feel safe in the ring i wouldnt do the changes on a curve but here i am now i have won a third gold medal and i am the most spoiled person in the world because i have had two wonderful wonderful horses
5842661 my horse did a super job over the three tests and today he was very fluent i had a good connection to his mouth his noseline was correct and we were working together i was very pleased
5842662 we have been nearly too good for the last three years and it is a bit of a shame that this has happened at the olympic games i was hoping it wouldnt happen here but we have team gold and it was very close between anky and me i really lost it in the special
5842663 im going to work towards that its a new challenge and i think im the youngest rider here so i can go
5842664 i think there is maybe two more years left for salinero and that will be it
5842665 and all i want to do now is ask that penfold park can be opened up for me tomorrow so that i can give salinero a nice hack out

5842668 a french governmental report confirms suspicions of a mass poisoning of bees involving hundreds of thousands of colonies of honey bees according to the report of the french scientific and technical committee bayers seed treatment gaucho pesticide is to blame at least in part
5842669 the public has no idea whether those studies have been submitted to the epa or not and if so what they show maybe they never came in maybe they came in and they show a real problem for bees maybe theyre poorly conducted studies that dont satisfy epas requirement

5842918 these new facilities are a significant and welcome addition to limericks outdoor recreational infrastructure the provision of this state of the art public park demonstrates the councils commitment to further improving the quality of life for local communities the development will be of particular benefit to the growing population of castletroy and surrounding areas
5842919 castletroy continues to experience growth in terms of developments and population therefore it is imperative that this is matched by the provision of important infrastructure such as recreational amenities
5842920 we want to try and declutter that area and create a public plaza
5842921 its already a great place for people to meet and were going to remove traffic and create a much more pedestrian zone with more and better street furniture
5842922 well move the bike stands to create space and well have to figure out where to put the horse and carts taxis and bikes
5842923 its a fantastic opportunity and it could be extended to college green and westmoreland street because were digging that up as well its a great opportunity to create a pedestrian spine through the heart of the city
5842924 st stephens green cant go back exactly as it was there will be some vents on the island but theyll be disguised
5842925 a lot of the trees in place need a lot of root space and were working with the office of public works to see what species can go back in we think 44 or 45 mature trees will have to be removed
5842926 theres radar mapping now which tells us exactly whats underground
5842927 well need quite a lot of land but weve tried to ensure were under public roads and land traffic management will have an impact on the city and it disruption will be more than luas
5842928 st stephens green oconnell street parnell square the mater and drumcondra all present big problems abbey street to the quays will have to be dug up and some side streets will be closed off in drumcondra the 2014 deadline is a big call its very complex but were taking an optimistic view some things are out of our hands and planning could take longer than expected
5842929 anyone who listens to my teaching and obeys me is wise like a person who builds a house on solid rock though the rain comes in torrents and the floodwaters rise and the wind beats against that house it wont collapse because it is built on rock but anyone who hears my teaching and ignores it is foolish like a person who builds a house on sand when the rains and floods come and the winds beat against that house it will fall with a mighty crash
5842930 jesus knows only one possibility simple surrender and obedience that is the only way to hear his word he does not mean that it is to be discussed as an ideal he really means us to get on with it jesus has spoken his is the word ours the obedience only in the doing of it does the word of jesus retain its honor might and power among us

5842941 thats why i did give an absolute commitment to the council that we will ensure that money is made available and it happens
5842942 were providing clarity for planning authorities in assessing flooding risk
5842943 if you take a major urban centre and theres a town centre at risk of flooding were not blocking the local authority from considering development but they must consider what to build not a hospital or sewerage treatment works but maybe a car park

5842950 earlier this year the 179 th airlift wing in ohio received a new flying mission to replace the mission they will be losing we have asked for a similar mission to keep together the great flying team in springfield

5842952 the expertise and capabilities of the 183rd fighter wing and its firefighter unit in springfield are critical to the security of illinois and the nation
5842953 these illinois guard members provide invaluable support to our national security readiness emergency preparedness i will continue working with senator durbin to secure a flying mission for the 183rd and maintain emergency response capabilities in our state

5842958 just pricing the distributional effects of congestion pricing and sales taxes
5842959 at a time when public officials in los angeles and other cities are considering congestion tolls and sales tax increases for transportation
5842960 asking drivers to pay for road use ignites debates over fairness but the debate often fails to address the larger question of how funding for transportation projects is actually being distributed throughout the community
5842961 freeways are a premium transport service and they should be priced accordingly the study shows that if we are prudent we can do that while being sensitive to the circumstances of low income drivers
5842962 while regular users can pay dearly for the right to bypass 9 miles of bumper to bumper traffic about 700 a year for heavy users and 300 a year for moderate users all such payments are voluntary because traveling in the congested free lanes is always an option
5842963 are tolls regressive according to this and many previous analyses yes but for transport policy whether tolls are regressive fails to fully address the justice and fairness issues that arise in financing road use
5842964 using sales taxes to fund roadways creates substantial savings to drivers by shifting some of the costs of driving from drivers to consumers at large and in the process disproportionately favors the more affluent at the expense of the impoverished

5843094 the georgian air force and artillery struck the sleeping town at midnight more than 1 500 civilians perished in the first hours of the shelling at the same time georgian special forces shot 10 russian peacekeepers who didnt expect such a betrayal from their georgian colleagues
5843095 does that mean that the u s and nato can use brute force when they want to and russia has to abstain from it even if it has to look at thousands of its own citizens being shot
5843096 i started exercising and i started eating more of the right food and i started feeling better i just get up in the morning and say my prayers

5843098 van dyke parks brian and melinda thought this should be a love letter to los angeles at this point brian was 65 years old and it just felt right to embrace his legend and be a bit nostalgic
5843099 kind of introspective kind of how i feel around people
5843100 yes brian had a rough time of it with his mental health but i would kill to have the kind of catalog he does and tour everywhere with his brothers like he did
5843101 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race

5843110 the results for gpsi prior to my arrival present quite a challenge
5843111 however i am extremely pleased with the progress made to date with our superior technology quality personnel customer support and established infrastructure gps industries has the tools to be successful we must continue to consolidate our operations reduce costs and be more efficient in delivering our industry leading products to the market i am highly confident we will rise to the challenges leaner better and much more successful than we have been in the past and i look forward to building on our initial successes
5843112 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
5843113 obama started to say that justice thomas didnt have enough experience for the supreme court
5843114 the second quarter of 2008 was noteworthy in several respects as infinity made significant progress on its nicaragua concessions and forest oil commenced drilling two new wells on our barnett shale property in erath county texas
5843115 in addition we were able to work with our vendors to settle a significant portion of our accounts payable and reduce our working capital deficit these developments along with the farmout with forest oil should allow infinity time to enhance the value of its remaining assets
5843116 although our revenue declined significantly following the sale of our producing oil and gas properties in colorado and wyoming to forest oil in january 2008 the companys second quarter operating loss was reduced substantially when compared with the prior year period higher oil and gas prices widened our revenue expense spread per mcfe from 3 19 in the second quarter of 2007 to 5 88 per mcfe in the most recent quarter
5843117 the sale of our producing properties in colorado and wyoming to forest oil allowed infinity to significantly reduce its outstanding debt we retained 100 ownership of our exploratory properties in the piceance basin and labarge areas in the rocky mountains along with a 20 working interest in any future wells that forest oil may drill in the sand wash basin meanwhile we are working closely with amegy to financially reposition the company in accordance with its business strategy and focus upon oil and gas development activities in texas and offshore nicaragua
5843118 i am pleased to report that forest oil has commenced drilling two in a series of up to ten new wells in erath county texas in accordance with its farmout relationship with infinity
5843119 assuming drill results are favorable we would expect to realize the benefits of initial production from these activities which are being funded by forest oil beginning in the third or fourth quarters of 2008 meanwhile our infinity texas subsidiary anticipates that its 2008 capital expenditures will be limited to less than 0 5 million to potentially complete two vertical wells that were drilled last year our infinity wyoming subsidiary expects to spend less than 0 5 million to plug and abandon and perform reclamation activities on several wells and potentially to conduct additional geological and geophysical analysis
5843120 we continue to work towards finalizing the contracts related to our 1 4 million acre offshore oil and gas concessions in nicaragua
5843121 last week as previously reported the regional government council of the autonomous region of the northern atlantic
5843122 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5843123 cone of silence is a silly term i used from maxwell smart
5843124 we had him a green room in a totally different building

5843153 its an interesting story i am very pro choice but i feel horrible about infants being allowed to live and then die alone its terrible however if obama not supporting the baipa act means that roe vs wade is strengthened then i am in favor of his stance

5843161 the fcics approval of agrisure and other traited corn seeds acknowledges reduced risk for growers
5843162 we worked with john deere risk protection to create a better opportunity for growers to access crop insurance discounts a unified endorsement aligns with growers preferences for choice and the crop insurance industrys need for consistent policies across seed brands
5843163 the approval of this endorsement by the fcic should spark additional discussions regarding how technology can impact risk reduction regardless of the technology provider
5843164 we look forward to conversations that take into consideration the value of choice for growers importance of market competition and implementation considerations faced by the crop insurance industry
5843165 we applaud the work of syngenta john deere risk protection and the fcic and rma in extending access to the risk management biotechnology endorsement to growers across a wider portion of the corn belt

5843167 in a time zone that is within four hours of the local time zone of the other
5843168 count the greatest number of physical processors at any time supporting running instances across your server farm and assign that number of licenses
5843169 these instances run on a server farm made up of 20 servers each with four physical processors if just three unique physical processors support the three running instances then based on the licensing changes you need only three sql server 2008 enterprise processor licenses so you can run those three instances anywhere in your server farm if however two physical processors support each of the running instances for a total of six unique physical processors in this scenario you would need six sql server 2008 enterprise processor licenses without the licensing changes you would need 80 processor licenses to support moving the instances freely in the server farm

5843171 we are extremely pleased to have the opportunity to become involved in a project of such high quality
5843172 the lucky jack project is one of the largest high grade undeveloped molybdenum deposits in the world with a historical mineral resource in excess of 700 million pounds of molybdenum
5843173 as with any project of this magnitude there are challenges
5843174 naturally we will review the details of the project and take a fresh look at all aspects of the previously planned development and we will seek the input of the residents of the county in addition we will work as we always do with local state and federal officials and agencies to ensure that the project is developed in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations fortunately our company has the experience and resources to develop and ultimately reclaim the property in a professional efficient and environmentally sound manner
5843175 the facts are clear and unfortunately its becoming more and more obvious the status quo is not working america is not a sexually healthy nation for this to change we must acknowledge this reality and embrace the important role condoms play in maintaining ones sexual health

5843185 airports are significantly impacted by weather and this new designation is reflective of our airports commitment to operating the safest possible air transportation facilities for our customers and the communities we serve
5843186 the united states is the most severe weather prone region of the world the mission of the national weather service is to reduce the loss of life and property from these storms and stormready will help us create better prepared communities throughout the country
5843187 just like communities businesses and families need to be storm ready by having an action plan for severe weather through stormready the national weather service plans to educate every american about what to do when severe weather strikes because it is ultimately each individuals responsibility to protect him or herself
5843188 we view being the first airport system in the country to receive stormready designation as more of a responsibility than an honor
5843189 thanks to the initiative of our emergency management team the airport authority plans to engage entities throughout the airport community in addition to each of our neighboring communities through our outreach efforts to ensure our airports are the anchors of a greater community ready for all types of severe weather

5843196 oh yeah mccain sucks more bush sucks did you know that obama played basketball and he still goes to the gym
5843197 we are pleased to announce record revenues for the year but obviously are not happy with the net income for the quarter or year license revenue fell off dramatically for the quarter compared to last year and slightly for the year which had a significant impact on both top line revenue and gross margin our support and services revenue continues to grow at a very healthy pace driven by our electronic processing services which include atm debit card bill payment and remote deposit capture our managers and employees continue their on going focus on our customers while also maintaining a focus on cost control during this challenging period
5843198 we continue to develop new products and enhance the features and depth of functionality in our existing products to meet our customers demands which also allow them to effectively compete with any financial institution obviously this means we have to continue to increase our spending on research and development which increased significantly for the quarter and the year however considering the impact of the two acquisitions we completed last year this line of expense only increased organically by 5 percent for the quarter and 15 percent for the year compared to the same periods a year ago
5843199 we believe these demands are a good sign that our customers look to us to fulfill their technology needs as we continue to focus on our primary strengths of providing the most powerful and flexible technology in the industry and our commitment to provide our clients with outstanding service
5843200 our managers did a good job of controlling our operating expenses during the year we had a one time write off of some fixed assets and above usual level of legal and accounting costs in the fourth quarter or the total dollar expense would have been basically flat for the quarter and those combined with additional personnel costs and higher user group costs caused the increase for the year compared to the prior year periods also selling and marketing expense increased at approximately the same pace as revenue for the year but considering the impact of the companies acquired during the year they only increased 5 percent and 7 percent organically for the quarter and year respectively

5843217 cutting interest rates is going to lead to a lot of inflation in the next few years in the united states

5843223 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
5843224 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
5843225 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
5843226 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
5843227 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
5843228 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
5843229 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
5843230 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
5843231 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
5843232 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades

5843237 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
5843238 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
5843239 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
5843240 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
5843241 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
5843242 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
5843243 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
5843244 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
5843245 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
5843246 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
5843247 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
5843248 its 24 7 its potentially developable all over the country all over the world and for all that we really do think it could be the killer app of the energy world

5843254 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5843255 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5843256 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5843257 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5843258 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5843259 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5843260 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5843261 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5843262 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5843263 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5843264 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5843265 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5843266 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible

5843268 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5843269 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5843270 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5843271 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5843272 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5843273 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5843274 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5843275 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5843276 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5843277 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5843278 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5843279 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5843280 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5843281 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5843282 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5843283 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5843284 what is the proper native speaker grammatical order of chinese putonghua to construct a sentence

5843288 but it also makes sense if you live longer then you cost the health system more
5843289 lung cancer is a cheap disease to treat because people dont survive very long

5843291 make them different make them extremely special when people only do beats the only ones who really win are the ones who have beats that dont sound like other peoples its hard to do an imitation because people will know the difference most times
5843292 it all comes down to quality of your product if you can find an independent distributor who actually likes what you do its easy the problem is right now its the worst time in hip hop because everybody raps in some way or another whether its good or bad everybody raps everybody is an artist its almost like this is the new football or the new basketball i was lucky enough to meet l a reid and meet other people to see that there were other things in the business and actually find out that i was actually good at those other things sorry i got off the subject you just have to get your name out there i think the mix tape thing is a little overdone so that really doesnt mean as much anymore because its not hard to make a song over a song thats already cut it doesnt mean that youre hot it just means that you recognize that this is a good song
5843293 ill never forget one day he was upset because he couldnt afford his grain bill
5843294 i said wiley youre sitting on 50 million here and he told me he didnt care that he loved his cows and was going to stay on the land until he died he was a kind sweet man and he really loved those cows
5843295 i just hope that the company cant finish it so we can start over
5843296 they are building those big homes you cant buy those things and you got people going in who cant afford them and thats why we have the problems we have today
5843297 life is a tragedy up close and a comedy in long shot
5843298 oh btw we just happen to have one of those that we ordered by accident
5843299 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
5843300 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position

5843311 foundations and corporate giving programs support media to bring about change to tell stories that otherwise wouldnt be told
5843312 the council sees the festival is a venue to disseminate those stories its another way to help our members do their work
5843313 a resource for grantmakers who fund media content infrastructure and policy and who employ media to further their program goals
5843314 electronic media is a vital form of human expression communication and creativity and plays a key role in building public will and shaping civil society

5843335 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5843336 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
5843337 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5843338 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5843339 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5843340 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5843341 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous

5843357 the white house isnt the place to learn how to deal with international crisis the balance of power war and peace and the economic future of the next generation a president has got to know the territory but thats not enough
5843358 it strikes me that any pick designed to cover up a flaw in obama i e lack of foreign policy credentials only accentuates those flaws

5843369 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5843370 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5843371 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves

5843376 our issue has not been lack of effort it has been lack of talent
5843377 this is pro basketball and good coaching and gutty performances can only take a team so far the mystics need athletes and we need scorers and we need a roster of young ladies whose collective physical skills make other teams in the league dread the thought of playing us
5843378 the mystics have been operating for too long without a long term plan

5843392 furthermore we continue to strike a favorable balance of spot exposure and long term cash flow generation as illustrated by our chartering strategy
5843393 for example and as we announced yesterday we renewed charters out on two of our vessels at an 80 premium to their previous rates and also chartered out two newbuilding capesize vessels well before their expected delivery these secure charters are complemented by new vessels to be delivered charter free to navios holdings fleet in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 this advantageous time charter and spot mix should continue to enhance our financial flexibility as we continue to pursue our growth strategy and provide returns to shareholders

5843572 the only option that theyve offered is a refund which is useless at this point since the tickets are twice as expensive as they were when i purchased them
5843573 delta is claiming their codeshare partner changed the schedule and that theyre under no obligation to offer us new travel dates unless the partner airline has tickets with the exact same fare code
5843574 regardless of the outcome our agents shouldnt be telling a customer to call the carrier
5843575 her first choice would be a united codeshare flight and if they are unwilling to budge on that a refund

5843590 i can only speak well of mourinho he is an exceptional person and has great personality he has an excellent rapport with all the players and is always correct he says what he thinks and does what he thinks
5843591 also we have adopted a new set up 4 3 3 which allows us to be more attack oriented compared to before
5843592 im getting used to my new position and im crazy about it we are all growing together improving our movement in the middle of the pitch while im learning to speed up my game to have more time to play and think
5843593 who knows maybe sooner or later i may even get to clean some rust from my right foot near the goal
5843594 im here raring to go we want to get going again and work towards becoming key players looking to write another important chapter
5843595 if lippi has come back its because he wants to win the world cup again which for us is another reason to do better
5843596 i think its important to start the season on the right foot and i want to compete to the best of my abilities for the azzurri shirt
5843597 with baptista the team has been further strengthened it would be fantastic to win the league title and dedicate it to our great president well do our utmost to reach objective
5843598 there are a lot of us in midfield this year and all of us have different characteristics the boss will field who has shown can be trusted most on the field im only thinking about working hard as being left out doesnt please anybody
5843599 melo has surprised us he is a player who is charged up and nasty to the right degree felipe will give us a big hand in midfield
5843600 i wanted to take him to lecce when he was 19 years old and had just won the brazilian title with cruzeiro but he cost too much i continued to follow him when he went to almeria and unknown to everybody i had blocked the player and was trying to lower the buy out clause of 9 million
5843601 marino and de laurentiis are doing positive things and it would be fantastic to see napoli also competitive in europe
5843602 we are happy to participate in a tournament such as this its always a pleasure to come back to play in naples i could never forget the napoli of diego maradona
5843603 before beating juventus we hadnt set off well from the first friendly but from the moretti we want to gain the right impetus to start the championship well
5843604 if you want to start a conversation with anyone in the asteroid business all you have to say is tunguska
5843605 it is the only entry of a large meteoroid we have in the modern era with first hand accounts
5843606 at first the locals were reluctant to tell kulik about the event
5843607 they believed the blast was a visitation by the god ogdy who had cursed the area by smashing trees and killing animals
5843608 those trees acted as markers pointing directly away from the blasts epicenter
5843609 later when the team arrived at ground zero they found the trees there standing upright
5843610 a century later some still debate the cause and come up with different scenarios that could have caused the explosion
5843611 but the generally agreed upon theory is that on the morning of june 30 1908 a large space rock about 120 feet across entered the atmosphere of siberia and then detonated in the sky
5843612 the great majority of the asteroid is consumed in the explosion
5843613 yeah just look around you 99 percent of the people here are total hipsters
5843614 these hipster zombies are the idols of the style pages the darlings of viral marketers and the marks of predatory real estate agents

5843630 black cherry bombshells is dynamic and action packed fans of manga and comics should love the edgy retro style art
5843631 just the right side of grim with a dash of playful thrown in for good measure
5843632 the creators have admittedly and successfully super imposed female characters over traditional male action movie roles
5843633 the black cherry bombshells are definitely the cool shit like land of the dead made babies with thunderdome pretty awesome

5843701 innovation is the path to massive quantities of cleaner cheaper energy the people were funding today have a real shot at lowering the cost of egs and bringing us closer to our goal of renewable energy cheaper than coal
5843702 egs is critical to the clean electricity revolution we need to solve the climate crisis but egs hasnt received the attention it merits thats why were pressing for expanded support from government and increased investment from the private sector egs is critical to the clean electricity revolution we need to solve the climate crisis but egs hasnt received the attention it merits thats why were pressing for expanded support from government and increased investment from the private sector

5843707 everybody was moving very slowly and there were great opportunities for him to play overseas for a lot of money fenerbahce are turkish champions and a euroleague team it was a tough decision and it came down to fenerbache and triumph in russia
5843708 and hes very aggressive he moves well hes a good nba player
5843709 that anyone is available it used to be that they would only go after certain kinds of nba players they would make offers to unrestricted free agents or to players who were at the end of their careers but now they sense that there is an opportunity thanks to the way the collective bargaining agreement is set up that they can go after and get nba players its a whole new world
5843710 after being directed to get off the ice bertuzzi was on his way back to the bench when suddenly and without warning he turned around and skated back in the direction of moore and attacked moore
5843711 this was not done under any specific or general direction or encouragement from crawford was a direct disobedience of the instruction that bertuzzi had been given from the bench to get off the ice and was a violation of bertuzzis duties which crawford could not be expected to have reasonably anticipated let alone control the court filing stated
5843712 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5843713 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that
5843714 he slept on his arm the other night and he came in and felt some tingling in his fingertips
5843715 as far as pain goes its not that much pain at all with it its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered until now
5843716 for me it isnt about breaking other peoples records im not interested in the limelight
5843717 i just like catching fish and getting better at it i like improving on my own achievements
5843718 it might take me years but i want to get something really big like 130lbs in my net mrs street was on a nine day trip to the lake with her husband chris a 39 year old driver when she struck lucky
5843719 i shot out the bivvy and knew id caught something big straight away because of the way the rod was angled
5843720 i was half asleep and the fish was putting up a really big fight it had swum into the reeds further down the lake
5843721 i just kept going and going at it until id reeled it in that took about 50 minutes alone
5843722 then i had to wade out into deep water put my hand in its mouth and pull it in i was shouting let me do it and i managed to scoop it into the net on my own
5843723 to get it on the bank all in all took about an hour
5843724 we cant for the life of us work out why they do it
5843725 were doing systematic observations now to determine if theres something that may trigger it but so far we havent found anything
5843726 this indicates that they do learn from each other which is not a surprise really but it does also seem that they exhibit elements of what in humans we would call cultural behaviour
5843727 these are things that groups develop and are passed between individuals and that come to define those groups such as language or dancing and it would seem that among the port river dolphins we may have an incipient tail walking culture
5843728 our security and the very future of our planet the choices we make in november and over the next few years will shape the next decade if not the century
5843729 our security and the very future of our planet the choices we make in november and over the next few years will shape the next decade if not the century
5843730 either they stand there not saying anything and then they talk to me or they start crying
5843731 she d be here until after midnight working on it just incredibly dedicated
5843732 didn t work out because everybody liked the gray and the white so i just left it in pencil
5843733 and nods her head and just shows the respect to the corpsmen on the wall as well as the person that wants to tell their story
5843734 i don t know if she really appreciates the impact that it has on people but i think she s learning
5843735 i don t mind flying cockroaches spiders or snakes but this thing
5843736 the children in the family i worked for collected bugs
5843737 the land has been in military use for many years
5843738 hard to imagine any legal entity requiring microsoft to begin reselling an ancient software product that is not as functional secure or reliable as its successor
5843739 this can be seen through the size of the utility size announcements from companies such as optisolar sunpower duke energy and southern california edison
5843740 take advantage of insulation costs and because of economies of scale on the procurement side
5843741 it is our companys policy not to comment on pending litigation and thus will not comment on the specifics of this case
5843742 that said the courts ruling simply means that the parties will engage in discovery and proceed with the litigation the judge did not opine at all on the merits other than to conclude that fox satisfied the pleading requirements we respectfully disagree with foxs position and do not believe they have any rights in and to this project
5843743 to move from a musharraf policy to a pakistan policy
5843744 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5843745 i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition
5843746 i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5843747 for all his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell
5843748 senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan
5843749 if we have actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets and president musharraf wont act we will
5843750 if we had just done what i said last year
5843751 our troops have performed magnificently and violence is genuinely down but listen if you drive a bus into a ditch and then after five years and a trillion dollars and 4 000 lives lost you are getting the bus halfway out of the ditch it doesnt mean you made a good decision driving the bus off the road in the first place
5843752 one of the reasons that the public schools in the city have gotten better is because the charter schools exist and give parents an alternative and let parents see that you can do something better

5843755 adult stem cells have become successful and commonplace in treating what would be career ending injuries in racehorses
5843756 some politicians and members of the media would do well to take note of this and of similar successes in humans before they continue touting life destroying embryonic stem cell research
5843757 it used to be sort of expected that there was a phase of life where you had children and a lot of women arent doing that now
5843758 there is the perception perpetuated in large part by hollywood that you can wait until your late 30s or even your early 40s and have a baby without too much trouble
5843759 its really difficult for a woman over 40 to conceive
5843760 women feel cultural pressure to get all of their schooling done and much of their career building done before they even start to think about marriage
5843761 my advice is to make getting married and having babies at least as much of a priority as your education goals and career goals
5843762 so much of our culture has made kids seem like big sacrifices and a big inconvenience
5843763 there is something to being an increasingly secular society and being a little self absorbed in not thinking about the legacy you want to leave

5843768 theres no doubt that people are scheduling labour much more tightly this christmas than others id be surprised if you dont see significant job cuts over the next six months

5843772 advertising could be made much better if it tried to please its audience instead of treating them like victims who deserve x amount of abuse in return for whatever free site theyre getting it doesnt work anyway audiences learn to tune out boring ads no matter how loud they shout what we have now is basically print and tv advertising translated to the web the right answer will probably look very different it might not even seem like advertising by current standards so the way to approach this problem is probably to start over from scratch to think what the goal of advertising is and ask how to do that using the new ingredients technology gives us probably the new answers exist already in some early form that will only later be recognized as the replacement for traditional advertising bonus points if you can invent new forms of advertising whose effects are measurable above all in sales

5843805 yeah we know each other so its only right that we acknowledge each others presence by making small talk
5843806 to be certain of god means that we are uncertain in all our ways we do not know what a day may bring forth this is generally said with a sigh of sadness it should be rather an expression of breathless expectation we are uncertain of the next step but we are certain of god he packs our lives with surprises all the time
5843807 when we become advocates of a creed something dies we do not believe god we only believe our belief about him if we are only certain in our beliefs we get dignified and severe and have the ban of finality about our views but when we are rightly related to god life is full of spontaneous joyful uncertainty and expectancy

5843811 now part of the reason they didnt have it such a provision was purposeful because those who are opposed to abortion and i dont begrudge that at all they have a moral calling to try to oppose what they think is immoral oftentimes what they were trying to do was to polarize the debate and make it more difficult for people so that they could try to bring an end to abortions overall
5843812 my goal is to bring people together to listen to them and i dont think there is any republican out there who ive worked with who would say that i dont listen to them i dont respect their ideas i dont understand their perspective and i do not consider democrats to have a monopoly on wisdom and my goal is to get us out of this polarizing debate where we are always trying to score cheap political points and actually get things done
5843813 now i dont think that mental distress qualifies as the health of the mother i think it has to be a serious physical issue that arises in pregnancy where there are real significant problems to the mother carrying that child to term otherwise as long as there is such a medical exception in place i think we can prohibit late term abortions
5843814 medical judgment exercised in the light of all factors physical emotional psychological familial and the womans age relevant to the well being of the patient
5843815 ok but obamas position on abortion is still better than john mccains

5843825 there were no crosses no murals no statues or icons of any kind as far as i could see i had never been in a christian church that didnt have that sort of thing i found the simplicity very appealing
5843826 i was used to a very formal highly structured worship service in the church of my childhood
5843827 i was intrigued by how smoothly and efficiently things were handled without extensive ritual or ceremony and i was touched by how friendly and open everyone was especially to visitors like my family it was refreshing to me
5843828 our chapels are not all constructed with the same design features

5843838 they dont have something positive to say about what theyre going to do for america what they try to do is they say well this other guy hes unpatriotic or this other guy he likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5843839 right now im supporting the governor and i would urge him to run for re election
5843840 if he leaves and goes with the feds for example clearly the democrats would have a lot of candidates and i would hope theyd think id be a good candidate im ready to do the job
5843841 if i had a criticism its that he throws up too many trial balloons
5843842 hes done a decent job as us attorney however certain involvements are questionable hiring his boss former attorney general john ashcroft to fulfill a multi million dollar federal monitoring contract is a real conflict of interest
5843843 that action came right when the u s attorneys job was on the line
5843844 his name was on the attorney generals list slated for replacement and why it came off that list i dont know but the fact that its been two years since the u s attorney dropped that subpoena and there have been no charges that stinks
5843845 i dont care if it was bob menendez in that campaign chris christie or bill pascrell but you cant hit someone with a subpoena let people dangle out there and then smile about it post haste
5843846 im still trying to figure out what he was going to charge him with but to cast a cloud like that over menendez for this amount of time two years and not file charges wrong
5843847 mccain views this as the one decision that he has total utter nonnegotiable control over

5843852 this get rich scheme is no doubt the plan of the oxford county casino promoters just as it is for the people behind the latest proposal for slot machines at scarborough downs meanwhile the voters are left wondering who is really behind these operations and where the financing is coming from
5843853 throughout his long career congressman allen has supported fairness and equality while opposing discrimination his voting record on lgbt issues is exceptional he has worked to eliminate discrimination in jobs housing public accommodations and financial matters and we look forward to working with him to win fully inclusive federal employment non discrimination legislation

5843860 because he failed to protect the taxpayers at a crucial moment we should not elevate mr williams to high office
5843861 its unfortunate this designation was made because i have a lot of outstanding questions that have yet to be answered based on his hearing statements as well as my previous oversight of the gsa
5843862 leading gsa during this period of transition is an exciting opportunity and i look forward to teaming with our superior workforce on key ongoing initiatives and preparing for the next administration

5843962 to finally get the gold medal on my very last routine meant the world to me
5843963 we went out there and showed we are the best going 1 2 in the all around thats never been done by the united states the americans have never had 1 2 on beam before either and 2 3 on floor isnt too bad
5843964 four years ago we had a large failure and we blamed ourselves
5843965 i would never trade one of my silvers for gold
5843966 what i went through to get them is very special to me and really touched my heart
5843967 she came in with the possibility of winning a few gold medals and that hasnt happened we were running out of chances
5843968 i knew it wasnt quite my best routine but i knew it was enough for a medal but im really happy for shawn three silvers is kind of hard to take i couldnt be more proud of her
5843969 thats the great ending she was a little bit disappointed after the all around but she went all the way to the end i can appreciate that
5843970 to finally have a gold and be an olympic gold medalist its what everyone dreams of

5843997 much of this work is at the intersection of what electrical engineers and computer scientists do as opposed to pure computer science

5844004 one weakness with previous systems is that you cant support large open spaces or large battlefields where there are a lot of people directly interacting with each other this paper which has been borne out of the collaboration with microsoft discusses how to address a particular aspect of the game where you really want a large interacting body of people
5844005 given todays communication bandwidth available to the typical home user as well as the update for these particular games we believe we can get to a typical realistically sized battle

5844007 microsoft has invested heavily in creating datacenters as have others in the industry but to keep them running at an optimal level is a constant challenge
5844008 the idea is to get rid of many of the switches inside datacenters do the routing at the edges the servers themselves and let them create a mesh inside the datacenter so packets can move quickly
5844009 its a notion that could reduce the cost of building and operating large datacenters tremendously
5844010 the reality is that end users are the ones who are actually using the services
5844011 when you do a live search that search is executed inside a datacenter when you look at live maps or run exchange from a web site all of these services are running on computers inside the datacenters how do we ensure that when you click on something immediately the answer comes back how do we bring the cost down how do we increase reliability

5844042 count the greatest number of physical processors at any time supporting running instances across your server farm and assign that number of licenses
5844043 these instances run on a server farm made up of 20 servers each with four physical processors if just three unique physical processors support the three running instances then based on the licensing changes you need only three sql server 2008 enterprise processor licenses so you can run those three instances anywhere in your server farm if however two physical processors support each of the running instances for a total of six unique physical processors in this scenario you would need six sql server 2008 enterprise processor licenses without the licensing changes you would need 80 processor licenses to support moving the instances freely in the server farm

5844054 me cans de dar golpes pero no me marcaban no importaba lo que hiciese en el cuadril tero
5844055 todo lo contrario para l que no me tocaba y le sub an puntos sin ning n tipo de justificaci n
5844056 ahora me siento frustrado pero satisfecho porque lo di todo en el cuadril tero y me considero ganador

5844061 ha sido descarado se ha visto c mo ha salido de castigado el p gil ruso y en la puntuaci n le han dado como si fuese a la inversa

5844093 a predicate of course not that utterance doesnt make any sense tastes more like what this utterance
5844094 that is they want to make the claim that the product has improved without making the admission that the previous formulation was less than delicious
5844095 diet dr pepper tastes more like regular dr pepper than diet coke tastes like regular coke
5844096 that is they want to assert that their product is superior to a competing product

5844098 that predicate happens to be utterly false for technology x because he was not actually stating a predicate that could be true or false of x i was unable to answer the guys question about x

5844179 a lot of times when you build a house this fast you dont have a lot of time for the crown molding and the little detail parts well these guys have spared no expense and it is adorable in there it is the most charming house i think weve ever done it is so cute

5844181 weve made it work we have probably 25 portables on our campus and the cafeteria that theyre squeezed into the teachers and administration have worked together to make that happen

5844189 the mystics have not moved one ounce in their 11 year history and weve got to start making some changes it is the only way this team is going to survive
5844190 if i cant move the marker here im going to lose my fan base im going to lose my corporate support and i just might as well shut down and i dont want to do that i want to make a difference in this team i want a winning team
5844191 our issue has not been lack of effort it has been lack of talent
5844192 this is pro basketball and good coaching and gutty performances can only take a team so far the mystics need athletes and we need scorers and we need a roster of young ladies whose collective physical skills make other teams in the league dread the thought of playing us
5844193 the mystics have been operating for too long without a long term plan
5844194 in the three years that i have been an owner and a general partner our thinking has been far too shortsighted and our player personnel decisions are far too needs based that all ends today

5844374 coffee consumption was associated with a modestly lower risk of renal cell cancer pooled multivariate rr for 3 or more 8 oz 237 ml cups day versus less than one 8 oz 237 ml cup day 0 84 tea consumption was also inversely associated with renal cell cancer risk pooled multivariate rr for 1 or more 8 oz 237 ml cups day versus nondrinkers 0 85
5844375 we observed a significant inverse association between coffee consumption and the risk of developing invasive colon cancer among women compared with those who almost never consumed coffee women who regularly consumed 3 or more cups of coffee per day had a rr of 0 44 in men no significant decrease was observed in any colorectal cancer site
5844376 women who reported moderate pre pregnancy caffeinated coffee intake had a significantly reduced risk of gdm adjusted rr 0 50 95 ci 0 29 0 85 compared with non consumers no risk reduction was associated with decaffeinated coffee intake
5844377 women who drank gt 6 cups d had a lower risk than did women who drank gt 0 3 cups d coffee abstinence is associated with a lower hypertension risk than is low coffee consumption an inverse u shaped relation between coffee intake and risk of hypertension was observed in the women
5844378 coffee consumption is associated with increased wave reflections but not aortic stiffness in never treated hypertensive patients
5844379 past and current coffee drinkers had a reduced risk of incident diabetes odds ratio 0 38 95 ci 0 17 0 87 and 0 36 this study confirms a striking protective effect of caffeinated coffee against incident diabetes
5844380 neither caffeinated nor decaffeinated filtered coffee has a detrimental effect on endothelial function in contrast the results suggest that coffee consumption is inversely associated with markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction
5844381 consuming coffee reduces cognitive decline in elderly men an inverse and j shaped association may exist between the number of cups of coffee consumed and cognitive decline with the least cognitive decline for men consuming three cups of coffee per day
5844382 consumption of green tea and coffee was inversely associated with risk for diabetes after adjustment for age sex body mass index and other risk factors multivariable odds ratios for diabetes among participants who frequently drank green tea and coffee gt or 6 cups of green tea per day and gt or 3 cups of coffee per day were 0 67 95 ci 0 47 to 0 94 and 0 58 ci 0 37 to 0 90 respectively compared with those who drank less than 1 cup per week total caffeine intake from these beverages was associated with a 33 reduced risk for diabetes
5844383 among premenopausal women consumption of regular coffee was associated with linear declines in breast cancer risk p for trend 0 03 consumers of gt
5844384 recent publications suggest that moderate coffee intake does not represent a health hazard but may even be associated with beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system and diabetes
5844385 coffee intake of more than 3 cups per day in hypertensive and prehypertensive men who regularly consume alcohol lowers blood pressure
5844386 this systematic review supports the hypothesis that habitual coffee consumption is associated with a substantially lower risk of type 2 diabetes
5844387 chronic coffee consumption exerts a detrimental effect on aortic stiffness and wave reflections which may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease
5844388 after adjustment for the variables listed above however these associations were not statistically significant conclusion over many years of follow up coffee drinking is associated with small increases in blood pressure but appears to play a small role in the development of hypertension
5844389 obviously we in canada have understood over the past several years how difficult this mission is
5844390 theyll go after the soldiers not so much that they think the soldiers are unarmed or afraid of them their aim i would say is to raise the political cost of the mission for the french president

5844397 the government has had a policy that wont accept a used fuel waste site in quebec
5844398 today however they have given the ok to producing more radioactive waste thats hypocritical
5844399 it usually takes 40 years for the radiation to subside enough to get near it

5844450 simply another type of enterprise architect that should be rolled into soa initiatives
5844451 it would be unreasonable to assume that the ea role will usurp replace or otherwise impinge on existing ba capabilities however the future of ea and the future ba are clearly moving in complementary directions to the extent that bas are dealing more and more with requirements for agility reuse and reduced cost of integration they will find themselves mirroring the activities of the ea groups in their organization likewise the more that eas find themselves responsible for translating ill defined business requirements into architectural models and service definitions the more they will find themselves filling a ba role in the organization

5844557 for public health reasons we remain concerned about the abuse of prescription drugs and any associated addiction overdose or deaths
5844558 our goals are to encourage physicians to treat legitimate chronic pain and to discourage recreational drug abuse i believe this updated analysis provides further evidence of the potential for remoxy to achieve these goals
5844559 the results of these studies further substantiate remoxys potential as a useful solution that may offer a new standard in chronic pain management
5844560 king is committed to developing uniquely designed medicines such as remoxy that not only meet the needs of chronic pain patients but also help address the problem of prescription drug abuse and misuse including use with alcohol which is currently threatening our communities

5844571 can run in any number of physical and virtual oses operating system environments within a server farm as long as the number of physical processors being used by running instances of the software at any one time does not exceed the number of licenses assigned to servers in the server farm
5844572 in a time zone that is within four hours of the local time zone of the other
5844573 count the greatest number of physical processors at any time supporting running instances across your server farm and assign that number of licenses
5844574 these instances run on a server farm made up of 20 servers each with four physical processors if just three unique physical processors support the three running instances then based on the licensing changes you need only three sql server 2008 enterprise processor licenses so you can run those three instances anywhere in your server farm if however two physical processors support each of the running instances for a total of six unique physical processors in this scenario you would need six sql server 2008 enterprise processor licenses without the licensing changes you would need 80 processor licenses to support moving the instances freely in the server farm

5844603 not all ssds are created equal weve actually been disappointed with the current level of performance on ssds currently in the market
5844604 weve been working on these for a long time intel has a deep understanding of solid state these new ssds that were announcing today are really setting the bar high for performance oriented ssd sata solutions whether they be non volatile memory caching or solid state solutions
5844605 they bridge the gap that currently exists between the memory and the cpu
5844606 cpu performance has been primarily driven by advances in our core ssd architecture and multicore architecture and has increased about 175 fold over the last 12 years whereas hard drive performance has only increased 30 percent
5844607 in essense the cpu is starved for memory so weve been taking our time and developing two types of ssds for the enterprise and for client notebooks and pcs weve raised the bar very high here with the 32gb to 160 gb ssds
5844608 at least five years of useful life in a notebook or pc application
5844609 this has been the challenge for the industry to design nand flash memory that can do more than just facilitate large file transfers of music and photos to and from usb thumb drives
5844610 when you go into a compute environment youre dealing with much smaller blocks and much more frequent reads and writes with our proprietary controller our firmware and 10 channel architecture weve been able to design an mlc device thats in a class by itself
5844611 ive always admired ruhls work but i fell in love with her after directing the clean house last season

5844615 everybody was moving very slowly and there were great opportunities for him to play overseas for a lot of money fenerbahce are turkish champions and a euroleague team it was a tough decision and it came down to fenerbache and triumph in russia
5844616 and hes very aggressive he moves well hes a good nba player
5844617 that anyone is available it used to be that they would only go after certain kinds of nba players they would make offers to unrestricted free agents or to players who were at the end of their careers but now they sense that there is an opportunity thanks to the way the collective bargaining agreement is set up that they can go after and get nba players its a whole new world
5844618 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words

5844630 the outcome is going to be determined by the team that continues to develop its car at the fastest rate there is a race on between us from one race to another
5844631 weve got some new parts for valencia weve had three races with a lot of parts theres a little bit less this time nevertheless our goal and mission is to improve the car by 0 15sec per race event thats a tall order occasionally you can outstrip that other times you fall behind on an individual race by race basis
5844632 we believed that the person he had to beat this year to win this years world championship was kimi and the two of them are lining up we can come away from valencia behind kimi or having extended our lead and i think thats going to go on for quite some time to come

5844652 competing with google is still a very daunting task as
5844653 they do have the talent that is used to building large industrial strength search engines
5844654 we go over the corpus web pages 12 times before we even index it
5844655 i love the smell of convergence in the morning it smells like victory
5844656 weve gotten dozens of responses and only two people have declined
5844657 i stressed out about not having chair covers because i thought the hotel chairs were ugly
5844658 this caused several arguments which i eventually lost but i showed up on the day of the wedding and my parents surprised me with them anyway
5844659 we were totally cool with a mid size wedding but once we got into the details of who was in and who was out we really struggled
5844660 it didnt help that my father thought he needed to invite every friend business associate and general acquaintance at the last minute we cut a couple we were friends with whose wedding and bachelor bachelorette parties we had attended only six months earlier
5844661 i havent been to many weddings where there wasnt an open bar during dinner
5844662 at the end of the day this industry will be a scale game
5844663 i think the industry will be well served by competition and competition from several players
5844664 if you look across all their assets were much stronger in the display space
5844665 theyre having a real struggle trying to engage advertisers with everything after their home page
5844666 to pretend that it has had no impact would be wrong
5844667 the complete failure of any other company to gain significant share against google
5844668 cuil came out of the gate with an index of more than 120 billion pages a number equivalent to more than half of the stars in our galaxy
5844669 its a daunting number and great technical achievement but its not a game changer for your typical searcher instead they need to focus much more on the quality of their results both from a relevancy and freshness perspective this is the only way to win users attention and ultimately their loyalty
5844670 consumers now had a choice of what electric company they wanted to buy electricity from
5844671 essentially each electric company gets zip codes it can service
5844672 because you can structure your ad copy to speak to the local market that can improve your click through rates and conversion rates
5844673 geo targeted campaigns can provide one level deeper of target ing
5844674 thats just a limitation to think about its not a reason to not do it
5844675 if youre doing any sort of testing it takes much longer to get the statistics
5844676 we use geo targeting more now than we did in the past and the ways in which we use it have become much more sophisticated
5844677 we know there are a handful of things that really put people into a shop ping mode one of them is theyre going to move
5844678 the site has more than 150 pages of content focusing on where you are in the moving cycle
5844679 not only are we buying those terms but were seeing ourselves come up more often in natural search
5844680 weve seen our new enrollments on the web site increase by 72 and our conversion rate has gone up 60
5844681 one of the only ways to get search volume to increase exponentially is to also run display
5844682 the cc gold coast builds upon the luxury sports coupe that debuted at the 2008 north american international auto show

5844684 a prototype from her paris hilton push up bra line
5844685 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
5844686 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
5844687 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away right away elections aint that kind of thing
5844688 there has been no evidence of any tampering on these machines
5844689 i think were the only county in the country that has that contract stipulation
5844690 i have a huge inventory of machines that i am not able to use
5844691 who wants to buy a system that has been decertified especially when other states are following suit
5844692 for the past several months we have been working closely with neversoft and activision harmonix and konami to ensure that playstation 3 guitars and drum sets will all feature a basic level of gameplay compatibility
5844693 it was like racing a car at max velocity when you hit a curve you either maintain control or you crash and burn
5844694 today i crashed and burned im shocked and sad but im happy for the girls
5844695 i kind of felt like she was me for a minute there
5844696 its heartbreaking because i saw her face afterward i know the feeling i know how she felt
5844697 i dont want to tell you what im thinking right now because its not positive i mean i feel so betrayed by my body once again and its just such a tough break for me
5844698 i kept saying what what i was hoping no one could read my lips
5844699 i couldnt believe i was holding the flag and getting a medal it was amazing
5844700 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race
5844701 its just a shame that it happened on the biggest race of my life
5844702 im just going to run my heart out and hope for the best
5844703 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5844704 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5844705 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5844706 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work
5844707 an important next step in the journey to ensuring the nations energy security
5844708 this is great getting a regular cable show is something ive wanted
5844709 the turnaround notice gave lawrence gordon productions the perpetual right
5844710 warner bros production and anticipated release of the watchmen sic motion picture violates 20th century foxs long standing motion picture rights in the watchmen property
5844711 we will be asking the court to enforce foxs copyright interests in the watchmen and enjoin the release of the warner bros film and any related watchmen media that violate our copyright interests in that property
5844712 dont expect them to go away for anything less than 25 million and they will take an amount like that now because they dont want to gamble either 100 of wbs profit could be 0
5844713 make it more darker and not commerciallize sic just like the dark knight the writer and the director make some risk to the movie and look what happen
5844714 in my experience that kind of behavior is something that isnt necessarily random
5844715 record opposing abortion and lukewarm support of other gender issues in general
5844716 we look forward to voters in staten island and brooklyn sending a strong supporter of womens rights to washington
5844717 steve has the values we need to improve the lives of women and families in this country
5844718 mrs bachman has made a remarkable recovery given the significance of her injuries she continues to get stronger each day and as her strength improves she is able to do more
5844719 words cannot express how much we all miss our dad
5844720 we are still trying to comprehend why this happened to such a lovable generous and heroic man
5844721 it has been difficult dealing with this tragic and sad event so far from home we are so grateful for all of the love prayers and support that have been sent our way

5844725 emis relationship with 30 seconds to mars has been extremely rewarding and successful for both the band and the company
5844726 the hard work of emis global team and of the band has resulted in sales of 3 million albums and singles multiple awards and a growing global fanbase however we have been forced to take procedural legal steps in order to protect emis investment and rights during contract renegotiations initiated by the band and management we hope to resolve these matters amicably and put them behind us so we can continue working in partnership with the band to take them to even greater levels of success
5844727 we had been signed to our record contract for nine years
5844728 basically under california law where we live and signed our deal one cannot be bound to a contract for more than seven years this is widely known by all the record companies and has been for years in fact so aware of it are they that they desperately try to make deals outside of california whenever possible it is a law that protects people from lengthy unfair career spanning contracts this law also gave us the legal right to explore other possible opportunities
5844729 we have been sued by the corporation quite simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void
5844730 we terminated for a number of reasons which we wont go into here
5844731 the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt
5844732 so we have lost many of the people that were near and dear to us at virgin emi and crucial to the success of 30 seconds to mars a few of the great ones are still there but it is hardly the same company we have known
5844733 we did not want to take this public but we felt it best to explain our point of view to you our friends and fans in hope that you can better understand our point of view
5844734 we would always do our best to avoid a fight but sometimes its important to stand up for what you believe in we hope that by doing whats right we can help to change things for the better for ourselves and possibly others
5844735 we have been sued by the corporation quite simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void
5844736 we terminated for a number of reasons which we wont go into here
5844737 we need serious sustained unfettered debate about the drinking age and the reality of life on a college campus and how these two things are aligned
5844738 instead of having 18 and 19 year olds drinking with fake ids now we will have high school seniors getting fake ids and buying alcohol for 14 15 and 16 year olds this is just moving the problem to a younger demographic
5844739 it has been proven many times over that the brain is not fully developed until the mid 20s and judgment is not developed as it should be so they dont have the ability to make determinations
5844740 we must engage in civil informed and dispassionate debate and consider all policy alternatives no matter how controversial
5844741 people tend to be more afraid of things such as cancer diabetes high blood pressure stroke but are really more likely to die of a traumatic brain injury
5844742 making sure that the surface in the bathtub is one that is safe
5844743 i have seen very very sad cases come through here

5844758 when we did kewells transfer a number of people criticised us a lot
5844759 but in just 25 minutes he showed us what he can do and what he is capable of doing those who criticised when we got kewell should talk now id be curious to hear what they have to say
5844760 he is very experienced and a superior degree of footballer in the match against kayserispor he put his quality forward again his experience will be a good layer for the team
5844761 after being injured to have a start like this im very happy
5844762 i wasnt sure about my physique and condition for the first steaua match i knew i needed to be completely ready
5844763 what about my own contract situation i am just happy playing my football but if anything like that comes about ill be delighted
5844764 ive got this season and two more years left im happy really happy with how things are going happy here at aston villa
5844765 i am just looking to build on the performances of last season during this season and im glad we got off to a good start at the weekend against manchester city
5844766 would i like to commit to a new contract of course it is a fantastic club i am delighted im playing here
5844767 ashley has been fantastic for us and we are in conversation with him over that a new contract
5844768 he is the goalkeeper at chelsea one of the best teams in the world
5844769 i think he has the ability to be one of the best goalkeepers in the world
5844770 everyone has made mistakes it has left him now and i think he is still the best
5844771 i have played three times since last years opening of the new wembley but this will be different
5844772 england dont know the words friendly games every match is equally important and they are deservedly very proud of their team
5844773 it is a test match and now england are playing more technically and with combinations compared to the past
5844774 i was surprised that they didnt qualify for the euros but i think they have a good and strong team and im sure they will qualify for the next world cup
5844775 they play offensive football with quick passes and the names show that they are a very strong team
5844776 hopefully the fans will see to the future that we have a new era after euro 2008
5844777 but im getting closer every day when i get the go ahead i guarantee ill be back in great shape and hopefully in a position to make an immediate impact for both everton and australia
5844778 the longer you are out the more you appreciate what it means to play at the top level and theres no doubt in my mind ill be back bigger and better than ever
5844779 the operation performed by highly respected surgeon kim slater went well but the rehabilitation has taken a little longer than id have liked
5844780 id planned to be back for the start of the premier league season but it wasnt to be
5844781 theres no way ill be rushing back before im ready that would be no good for myself everton or australia
5844782 hes always smiling keeping us on their toes on and off the field and with him in the team you always have a chance to nick a goal from a corner or free kick
5844783 or he might just ghost in and steal a goal when you dont think its possible
5844784 hes a great player and you need that kind of quality in the team
5844785 look its been hard missing out on a lot of football but i thankful for what ive already achieved in my career and i have a very supportive family and a great medical team behind me
5844786 i dont particularly enjoy watching football and when youre injured you dont really feel a part of things
5844787 but ive always been a positive person some people back in australia when i was a youngster didnt really rate me but i never took no for an answer and ive always liked to prove people wrong
5844788 i am happy that i have come to play for a major club like olympiacos i will do my best to satisfy the clubs administration and supporters
5844789 adding the herd to espnu will offer a unique flare to its programming lineup and expose his passionate group of sports fans to the 24 hour college sports brand

5844795 obama needs to stay away from issues of race as much as he can and although he brushed off bidens comments early in the primaries he cannot be seen as embracing a vp whom many thought was racist and insensitive toward obama himself imagine how much fun the republicans would have with that
5844796 i know how tough this is to navigate sometimes and im living proof that folks with the best intentions trip wires they dont mean to trip from time to time
5844797 would not endear whites to obama but it would raise questions about obamas decision making
5844798 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5844799 please tell your brother how inspired i was by his book i loved how positive and uplifting his message was
5844800 too bad obama didnt use the same tone when he talked about parenting he might not have rubbed so many folks the wrong way
5844801 its just that youve never felt any sort of judgment coming with run

5844807 recently the web site the politico asked nancy pelosi the speaker of the house why she was blocking attempts to tack offshore drilling amendments onto appropriations bills im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet she replied
5844808 you mean the same obama who didnt even know that afghanistan doesnt need arabic translators because they dont speak arabic
5844809 at least obama knows the difference between shias and sunnis unlike a senior republican candidate

5844829 hes disgraced himself hes an embarrassment to the clayton county police department his credibility and integrity as an officer is gone and i have no use for him
5844830 his behavior is unbecoming of that of a police officer
5844831 this turn of events from hero to someone who defrauds a nation is just baffling i dont know how he got from one point to the other
5844832 we havent been able to get in touch with him

5844842 i am devastated that due to the loss of a major investor in the harsh reality of a slowing economy there were no other options at this time than to postpone
5844843 there are so many variables in bringing a production to broadway theater availability artists schedules and securing capitalization to name but a few
5844844 its impossible not to be cognizant of the national economy and its potential impact on the theater but its also premature to say whether the recent changes in plans by certain shows represent a trend especially as were likely to see other productions quickly step up to fill the available theaters in their stead
5844845 speed the plow is a play about glamour sex and power and takes place in hollywood
5844846 i think speed the plow is less familiar than american buffalo and was overshadowed by madonna being part of the original production

5844849 the weak dollar has enabled an influx of foreign tourists and they go to see musicals
5844850 the cast and creative team were poised to create a terrific production and i have no doubt it will be just that when its time comes

5844852 el gobierno de m xico tiene el objetivo principal de velar por los intereses mexicanos en la empresa
5844853 y en particular asegurar que el proceso llevado a cabo por las autoridades de venezuela se apegue al marco legal aplicable y respete el principio de trato no discriminatorio

5844856 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
5844857 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5844858 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5844859 as peacekeepers or as human beings members of the russian military are responsible for making sure that the territory that they now occupy is free from these ravages against the local population
5844860 at the core of all of this is what it means to be a public broadcaster
5844861 and that is to provide programming for all canadians and to reflect the arts and culture scene in canada and to reflect canada back to canadians
5844862 so cbc is greatly compressing that kind of music which you could call serious music into a listening ghetto of 10 a m to 3 p m
5844863 i say ghetto just because they know anybody who looks at the numbers knows that the available audience between 10 and 3 is very small compared with mornings or evenings or the drive home or drive to work period
5844864 its an opportunity for them to show that they know how to do it
5844865 in this regard a bad choice hurts much more than a good choice helps
5844866 i think a week from tomorrow we will all know
5844867 its barbaric unnecessary its gratuitous cruelty and i dont believe most canadians would want to be associated with this type of redneck event
5844868 its easier to make a mistake when youre trying to sever the animals head if youre partying and drinking
5844869 if the animals head isnt severed its possible that they could be experiencing extreme pain and suffering
5844870 i would encourage these people to give vegetarian options a try
5844871 we are against the act of organizing something that amuses people over the death of an animal
5844872 the chicken killings take about 10 or 15 minutes out of the whole day
5844873 we kill them ourselves and we cook them on the barbecue everything is eaten that night
5844874 they didnt believe me so they tried it and thats how it started
5844875 the hen doesnt suffer we cut off the head in one shot
5844876 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5844877 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5844878 were obviously focusing on aspects that have to do with strategic or military situation but we will of course review everything
5844879 obviously we in canada have understood over the past several years how difficult this mission is
5844880 theyll go after the soldiers not so much that they think the soldiers are unarmed or afraid of them their aim i would say is to raise the political cost of the mission for the french president
5844881 were very proud to have the french making an enhanced contribution in afghanistan we believe it is essential for all nato countries to stay the course
5844882 i actually wrote the song goodbye about three years ago when nick and i first became really good friends
5844883 i was listening to jbs songs and i was like dude nick writes his own music i want to write music too
5844884 she hasnt been through all the stuff we went through to get here this is the end and this should be the fun times we all got the speech from rex that he wants to be here in the final with his girlfriend
5844885 i feel she stirs things up within the house rachel has been really awkward with me she has been unusual maybe its that we just clash things dont ring right with rachel big brother she avoids eye contact with me and shell look away really quick
5844886 she is quite negative about her experience in the big brother house when youve been here and been through some of the things weve been through it would be a better atmosphere without nicole
5844887 at the deep root of nicoles personality i think she is quite selfish i think she likes everyone running about after her
5844888 i genuinely think she is a nice person but you do still have to express your opinions
5844889 he is a nice guy but i wouldnt notice the difference if he wasnt here he just sort of farts makes people laugh about that sleeps and eats all the food
5844890 i feel very awkward around her i feel uneasy and i dont trust her at all
5844891 she is what i call a ship jumper she likes to jump ships shes a cling on
5844892 let them hear foundation they will charge a small fee but will appeal to the insurance company for you
5844893 youre going to have lots of food and its your kind of food too we appreciate this
5844894 everybodys having a hard time some of them cant afford to buy dog food
5844895 we heard about how some of the seniors were giving their food to their animals instead of eating it all actually its sad
5844896 were concerned that when we didnt bring out enough food the seniors might redirect the money they might spend on medicine or food for themselves to make sure the animal is take care of so were concerned it might be hurting the seniors themselves
5844897 well be bringing them out of this 7 thousand pound shipment weve got at least one thousand pounds allocated to them we ll help them as much as we can but dont let that stop anyone out there from helping them directly
5844898 this is going to help them by providing food for them the seniors are able to keep their pets at home
5844899 i was really really sick they gave me this teddy bear and i had to have a shot i was brave
5844900 i couldnt breathe it was a matter of life and death
5844901 i have to pay what little i have left to pay my lights to try to keep my lights on and this time i couldnt make it
5844902 its scary you know especially kids that need their medicines
5844903 it helps us get better so we wont get sick

5844908 education is a companion which no future can depress no crime can destroy no enemy can alienate it and no nepotism can enslave
5844909 a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys
5844910 if youre really selling a solution your price will go up over time its not about the products you sell its about the problems you solve its easy to shop for products based on price its not easy to shop for solutions based on price
5844911 if i was hauled out of the office one day in handcuffs when i went to hire a criminal defense lawyer i am not going to shop them on price
5844912 o j didnt go to johnnie cochran because he was cheap he did it because he was good
5844913 you dont shop that on price would you want to find the cheapest guy you can to get a laser and drill it into your eyeballs
5844914 if you position yourself in the market properly you will get premium prices
5844915 being able to define a business solution is where the profit lies
5844916 its all about your capacity to grow and what you need to do in order to grow
5844917 it really becomes an issue of are you structured right
5844918 if every time you make a significant sale you have to reinvent the wheel to deliver on it you are probably not very scalable or optimized
5844919 cdw was smart enough to ask for it at some point you have to stop worrying about what cdw does that is certainly no way to compete you have to do the best job you can and get as much as you can out of the vendor to achieve your business model
5844920 cdw cant be that critical defense lawyer or lasik surgeon
5844921 you can be cdw is all about driving commodities they want to be the low cost supplier
5844922 solution providers are not spending enough time thinking about how they are organized to drive profits
5844923 when they think of their organizations they still see themselves in the client server model of the 1980s and 1990s if you build it they will come technology is so last decade
5844924 you should market your talents as a solution provider and be a problem solver
5844925 will be deployed once we have agreed on the modalities
5844926 that would come i would say in the coming weeks
5844927 monitor the implementation of the six points of the cease fire agreement
5844928 humanitarian activities but will pave the way for other humanitarian organizations
5844929 this concludes a successful effort by our division of enforcement to stop fraud in its tracks return as much money as possible to defrauded investors
5844930 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice
5844931 hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
5844932 with the all new fit honda is offering premium features and advanced technology within a high function small vehicle package
5844933 customers who choose the fit are choosing superior refinement and premium quality along with value and economy
5844934 i would have liked to know whether he played chess in the same way he planned out his campaigns especially the battle of austerlitz
5844935 how do you prepare an attack how do you defend yourself
5844936 no but i admit that i sometimes had chess puzzles from newspapers lying in front of me on the government bench in the bundestag lower house of parliament
5844937 we cannot forget the crimes he has committed against the nation
5844938 i think everybody realises it means the world to me to retain the armband
5844939 to get the armband back is a huge achievement for me
5844940 i heard about an hour before the news conference just after training the manager called the whole squad together and told us as a whole
5844941 for me to get it above the likes of rio ferdinand and the other players in the squad is a great honour
5844942 id never given up on the armband and never will do
5844943 id heard the whispers that rio had got the armband so i was a little bit shocked but ive got to make the most of it
5844944 my target now is to qualify for the world cup and thats the aim going forward
5844945 rio when he was captain played very well the same level as john
5844946 it was not easy for me to choose because they are very good players
5844947 the big personality of john was the reason i chose john but rio is very important to the team
5844948 when we were first asked to do speed racer the property it was incredible it was very exciting it was a film by the wachowski brothers and it was about car racing awesome thats going to make a great game

5844963 a presentation at a security conference is not some sort of computer intrusion its a protected speech and vital to the free flow of information about computer security vulnerabilities
5844964 the mbta ultimately is trying to silence some uncomfortable truths that these students uncovered
5844965 they brought an action against three college kids rather than address the problems in their own house
5844966 the only other possibility that exists is someone who went down there who didnt sign up
5844967 immediate withdrawal of russian forces to the lines held prior to the outbreak of hostilities and the return of georgian forces to their usual bases
5844968 today in this room theres been yet another attempt to turn things on their head and portray the aggressors as the victim
5844969 theres a clear expression of propaganda in detriment to serious important political work which needs to be done in the security council
5844970 unfortunately the status of affairs in georgia has not changed despite the cease fire agreement reached a few days ago
5844971 georgia is occupied by russian military forces forces which are determined to devastate my country
5844972 had no choice but to enter into the settlement in order to avoid further incarceration
5844973 if this stands this single handedly undermines the entire civil judicial process in this country

5844977 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

5845011 we encourage parents whose children come across any forms of child exploitation images and videos or other inappropriate material to contact their nearest police station so it can be investigated
5845012 we are aware of cases where children have been unwittingly exposed to child pornograhy this poses a serious risk and parents need to be vigilaint about their childrens usage of peer to peer networks

5845025 by the end of the session commodities have given up about half their gains whereas the euro and aussie are still trading close to their highs
5845026 were still bullish on the us dollar but having gone up so rapidly and so much in advance of what interest rate differentials are doing there comes a point where market dynamics suggest that there could be some vulnerability
5845027 the story that we have is ongoing pressure on global economies ongoing pressure on commodities and ongoing pressure on commodity currencies
5845028 it doesnt add up to a very positive aussie dollar picture
5845029 inflation is way too hot and with housing way too cold we have the opposite of a goldilocks economy said joel naroff president of naroff economic advisors

5845036 i thought it might be all raggedy and not well organized
5845037 the doctors and nurses here really made me feel comfortable
5845038 once he said we re going out there to do it
5845039 once i got out here and saw what they were doing
5845040 many had expressed concerns that hps results were going to start to be affected by the economy but hp had solid numbers
5845041 the only other company that has a similar ability to stand out is ibm but thats a very different story a story of transitioning to a more service oriented approach
5845042 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5845043 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5845044 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5845045 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5845046 needs to figure out if hes going to let rush limbaugh and the right wing of his party direct his choice
5845047 thisll be the biggest week the industry has ever had in colorado
5845048 it was a wonderful thing but its nothing like the convention
5845049 ive got all our town cars booked up and all our sedans said eddie tehrani of executive transport
5845050 i still have three stretch limos and a party bus available and theyre going to have to start taking them because the sedans are all taken
5845051 there are a lot of limo companies outside of the metro area that have called me saying they can help out
5845052 but if people bring in cars from out of town i dont know where the drivers are going to stay
5845053 on one hand they are not quite as busy as usual so its easier to find the time to devote to this
5845054 but on the other hand they have been hit pretty hard by this downturn so they have smaller crews to call on what they all have in common is they stepped up to the plate
5845055 it was dark when they got here so they ended up insulating the house we were building when they were supposed to be insulating the house next door
5845056 so when i got here at 6 i was surprised to find our house was already insulated but its cosmic justice because the guys next door keep borrowing our supplies
5845057 theres a lot of guys a lot of testosterone here
5845058 i think it is great that something from the dnc is spilling over to a denver neighborhood
5845059 its going to let people and families really feel like they are part of it
5845060 we present this stuff in a real mainstream light i think one of the problems in trying to educate people is that a lot of scare tactics have been used were really trying to create a celebration of a new way of life and were doing it in a non preachy non didactic way
5845061 this will be the first time we are actually on the road
5845062 we want to take the funds and put them back into recreation and have tourists stay a bit longer
5845063 my experience is they lodging taxes have a negative impact
5845064 i dont think thats the intention but it may have unintended consequences
5845065 we have this great pool and its a fabulous facility
5845066 but its in need of work that the city doesnt have the money for
5845067 everybodys dialing for dollars and citizens will usually vote not to tax themselves
5845068 were not opposed to the concept were opposed to that amount and we want to be part of the planning
5845069 the idea is still very much alive but it needs more research
5845070 we were extraordinarily thorough and careful and colorado came out on top
5845071 states that can put huge cash on the table colorado is restricted and this is why this is such a huge victory
5845072 then get rid of the barriers to build a nuclear plant including disposal barriers and nuclear would thrive
5845073 wind and solar require gas or coal backup and can never be exclusive sources of power
5845074 finally the cloud of politics seems to be lifting and the debate of real substance has begun
5845075 i am optimistic that thanks to governor ritter a compromise is reachable
5845076 in our final recommendations we have incorporated inputs that we received from various parties
5845077 we will discuss the remaining rules with various parties but the commissioners will make their own final decision
5845078 if a little bit more time allows industry stakeholders and administration officials to find common ground thats terrific
5845079 we recognize there are trade offs there are compromises made thats how policy is made
5845080 we just want the commission to look at the language we dont think the commission should take shortcuts with colorados drinking water
5845081 people found ways to continue in the sport because the conditions were so good
5845082 the data suggests that a more diverse crowd visited the slopes this season perhaps brought out by the favorable snow
5845083 these are tight sands areas where theyve excelled at getting natural gas out of the ground
5845084 they think the easiest way to do that is to increase drilling
5845085 people who are at ground zero of energy development are much more divided on that specific issue
5845086 have no concept of the oil and gas development thats taking place
5845087 a better job of educating people in the states we do business so they understand the contributions the industry makes and have a more balanced picture of the industry
5845088 the price of oil is based on a worldwide market it has nothing to do with how much we drill colorado
5845089 securing the supply is the issue anyone who disagrees with me please give a reasonable i e sensible rebuttal
5845090 pelosi agreed just yesterday to allow debate and a vote on this very subject
5845091 i say let em drill and tax em to death while we can
5845092 forward socialize yikes it would not secure our supply rather diminish it
5845093 natural gas prices have spiraled up environmentalists point out even though drilling in colorado has increased three fold in five years
5845094 the us has some of the worlds most strict drilling regulations we need to supply clean oil from the us for us use and stop ruining third world countries simply because it is easier we need to deal with our own environmental degredation as a whole the world would benefit
5845095 you are denying basic laws of economics to justify the democratic oil blockade
5845096 not here not now not ever be happy for 20 gallon gas except for the exalted dnc users of gasoline powered vehicles
5845097 some of you want to see 10 a gallon gas so it forces many of us to invest and then buy alternative energy
5845098 republicans have been trying to lift the blockade for many years
5845099 they do not want additional exploration no matter how high gasoline becomes
5845100 who does i want quotes what mainstream politician has overtly expressed this as a policy initiative
5845101 my 7 year old came home with a very worried look on his face because people like you are telling him that the end of the world is going to happen if we dont do something about global warming
5845102 some of you want to see 10 a gallon gas so it forces many of us to invest and then buy alternative energy
5845103 drilling should be encouraged in the us not to drop prices but to stop the irresponsible environmental destruction exportation that the us system currently relies upon we are already drillling in the artic in siberia where there are little enviro control and even less enforcement an area around this drilling in the 90s was considered a disaster zone by the government from the pollution the us has some of the worlds most strict drilling regulations we need to supply clean oil from the us for us use and stop ruining third world countries simply because it is easier we need to deal with our own environmental degredation as a whole the world would benefit i have posted this over 50 times in various forums and have been completely ignored by the anti drilling crowd
5845104 i support alternative energies jay but i do not support 10 gallon to force the issue
5845105 i do not support higher gas taxes to force alternative energies
5845106 theyre going to rely upon businesses to be a part of the solution to the motorcycle rallies so what theyre discussing today literally impacts thousands of businesses
5845107 when you tell the businesses that they cant advertise to certain people or even the chamber to advertise to certain people i dont think thats a thing the city really needs to be doing
5845108 on an estimate i took in around 300 000 for harley week at all 3 hotels ok thats a hunk of change for me as a small motel owner
5845109 through general dynamics acquisition of this strong and rapidly growing organization we will expand our participation in the business aviation industry well beyond that of our current operations
5845110 the deal provides general dynamics with a global aftermarket footprint that will be required as new deliveries skew non american
5845111 with the global fleet aging and set to nearly double over the next decade bizjets have the most attractive growth and margin profile of any of general dynamics four units in our view

5845114 i have an incomplete album that i want to finish i have been thinking about the plan during my days in jail i have sung rock n roll for 40 years after jail i will rock n roll
5845115 a lot of people in pop and entertainment transgress in all sorts of ways and often it adds to the mystique and interest in them
5845116 but in the case of molesting girls it is a real no no if he tried playing shows he would probably meet a lot of opposition
5845117 who would book him who would give him a record deal there is no way out of it for him perhaps there would be market value in him selling his story but who would run with it

5845123 the idea of a goddess of destruction is one that ive cherished for a long time cedric victor bassist and visual collaborator mentioned kali when we were recording because of the thematic similarities to the songs i had already written
5845124 as we progressed everything seemed to come together around this theme of respect reverence for strength and simultaneous repulsion fear of power kali s narrative also discusses nietzsche s old adage that in fighting the monster one must be careful that one does not become the monster which seems to be a relevant message

5845132 in the current economic condition people are driving less and it obviously affects every facet of the u s auto industry including how often they replace tires or buy new cars
5845133 the current economic condition further impacted the stores but they were not performing well before this year and we dont expect them to perform well

5845140 in the greater boston area there are probably 50 farmers markets and compared to most cities a huge number of farms with their own farm stands
5845141 youve got allendale farm youve got verrill farm concord and wilson farm lexington up the north shore to amesbury from cider hill amesbury to marini ipswich its extensive here
5845142 every single open space farm in the area is approached regularly for development
5845143 unless we continue supporting them and showing them that they can be commercially viable theyre going to have to start selling land
5845144 these farms allow us to get the highest quality food while keeping our carbon footprint down

5845153 everybody knows that sargon sold his soul to the gods in exchange for black magical powers
5845154 while governments and the police can discourage speeding and drink driving through education and enforcement its impossible to legislate against absent mindedness aami spokesman geoff hughes said
5845155 drivers need to make better decisions about their fitness to drive whether it be refraining from driving when emotionally charged or consciously taking a break when fatigue sets in
5845156 go into auto pilot when they got behind the wheel of a car
5845157 the lifestyles of working professionals stay at home parents and even secondary and tertiary students is such that when they get in their car they have a tendency to go into auto pilot leaving them free to focus on everything else that is happening in their lives when they should be thinking about their driving he said in a statement
5845158 getting safely from a to b must be the priority for drivers from the time they turn on the ignition to the time they turn it off
5845159 this weeks meal featured pole beans from the garden chicken wrapped in bacon corn on the cob we arent tired of it yet and the cutest little baby red thumb potatoes
5845160 one the menu was potato tomato mozarella casserole fresh green and wax beans and garlic bread
5845161 this week i give you something that takes advantage of all of the lovely potatoes and onions at the farmers market ive made it local by serving it with sausages and sauerkraut from thurns potatoes from the worthington farmers market bacon from thurns and onions from wayward seed farms this potato salad is like the ones i grew up on very vinegary and smoky but a tad sweet at the same time i probably should have grilled the sausages but i ended up just cooking them in the sauerkraut enjoy
5845162 lunatic the two footy stars were unaware danyan had just been released from jail and was a hardened cage fighter
5845163 greg went for a few beers when some bloke belted nick youngquest he king hit him in the jaw cronulla chief executive tony zappia said
5845164 birdy then went in and he got whacked too birdy then wrestled the bloke to the ground before security intervened and escorted the bloke out of the premises
5845165 all greg was doing was protecting nick youngquest this happened at 6pm and birdy was home by 8 30pm
5845166 it wasnt late at night and he wasnt intoxicated he didnt leave our fan day until 3 30pm and this happened at 6pm greg was very open and honest with the club he came straight to myself and ricky stuart sharks coach and told us what happened
5845167 greg is old school he went straight in to help his mate the bloke really cleaned up youngquest he was a bit mad
5845168 i cant find out a reason as to why it happened but the players youngquest and holdsworth claimed it wasnt their fault
5845169 bird came in over the top he did the right thing the lunatic was then kicked out nick and bird went outside and got a taxi home they just wanted to get away it is a reminder that players need to be very careful about where they go for a drink and the type of people they mix with
5845170 we are extremely excited about the release of auto tune evo
5845171 when we looked at the computer power that we all pretty much take for granted these days we realized that by developing a new core processing technology that took advantage of that power we could offer capabilities that we could have only dreamed about back when we first introduced auto tune combined with a host of productivity and workflow enhancements auto tune evo is both the most powerful and easiest to use vocal processing tool weve ever offered
5845172 this concludes a successful effort by our division of enforcement to stop fraud in its tracks return as much money as possible to defrauded investors
5845173 you came to this city because you liked the way we were doing things so let us continue to do our job the way that weve done in the past that excited you about coming and if thats not it then i would certainly look for somewhere else to live
5845174 the rallies were here before most of these people moved here and a lot can be said on both sides i think that what he said was inappropriate
5845175 i have the short term memory of a gold fish
5845176 uh downtown has undergone a dramatic transformation but were still referred to as a branch campus
5845177 youve got to have the right products and those products have to be priced competitively
5845178 we have no excuse for failing to verify pulliams claims
5845179 had no choice but to enter into the settlement in order to avoid further incarceration
5845180 if this stands this single handedly undermines the entire civil judicial process in this country
5845181 this is a good move for intel and its good for customers that intel is making the move
5845182 it will speed development of solid state drive ssd technology and drop the cost smaller pc manufacturers will be able to buy pre integrated ssd drives that will seamlessly slide right into current laptop and desktop designs which means no additional redesign or development cost
5845183 on the plus side they are faster smaller and can take less power they arent mechanical and are thus more reliable than regular hard drives
5845184 the downside is that currently they are more expensive over time the price of ssds will come down but i believe most users will eventually have systems that utilize both ssds and traditional hard drives a decent sized ssd will give a speed boost while the regular hard drive will store the bulk of the data
5845185 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
5845186 i would rather have bleeding hemroids than fight for the ufc
5845187 para m el tema m s importante es que el libro llegue al lector y estoy de acuerdo en que de esto se ocupe la gente de mercadeo pero sin pasarse de los l mites en este caso creo que se han pasado de la raya
5845188 si le hubiesen preguntado a escritores ni os y padres se hubieran dado cuenta de que muchos est n indignados con la naturaleza prescriptiva de este esquema
5845189 no hay algo as como un ni o promedio de siete a os eso no tiene sentido hay tantas otras cosas m s importantes de las que deber an ocuparse
5845190 lo interesante acerca de los libros para ni os es que no son los lectores quienes los compran son los padres los abuelos las bibliotecas y las escuelas
5845191 creo que eso fue lo que pensaron las editoriales como lector si no te gusta un libro lo dejas pero el problema es saber primero qu tienes que comprar
5845192 it was an amazing feeling my dad had fixed it up for me i think it cost a fiver
5845193 he probably trains the hardest of anybody and hes very strict with himself but hes also a good guy he can turn off the competitive thing now and then and have a good laugh hes an inspiration
5845194 hes only human and hes got strengths and weaknesses well maybe not weaknesses maybe just weaker strengths but every time you do a personal best in training he gets up and beats it
5845195 you have to be very very careful about when you eat and when you rest
5845196 you get as much sleep as you can and you remind yourself that your opponents are having to do exactly the same as you so when youre tiring theyre tiring as well
5845197 i think the older you get the smarter you get you know the signs your body gives ive got stronger over the years ill have to take my foot off the gas pedal a little bit next year and try and build up for the london olympics but i feel very positive and im lucky i love what i do
5845198 i wouldnt be standing here with any medals round my neck if the meadowbank velodrome hadnt existed so who knows how many potential future olympic champions are out there why not built more facilities rather than knocking them down its about getting kids on bikes and into sport
5845199 i think pocket change as a business will benefit dramatically from having these types of resources at hand
5845200 even some of the bigger ad networks are looking at buying anchors in their specific categories
5845201 many of the people there had extensive service time with us and we wanted to make sure they were treated with dignity and respect
5845202 theyre ensuring that employees go out and say yes i lost my job but they gave me this also its proven that if a person goes through an outplacement firm the risk of a lawsuit is reduced dramatically
5845203 im not a young person and my main concern because im in my late 50s was how id be received in the job market
5845204 to hear that we were going to close was heartbreaking
5845205 after speaking with them i realized my leadership skills are transferable
5845206 companies tell us that even though theyre paying people to go to these workshops their productivity doesnt go down even though theyre eventually being laid off
5845207 thats a big concern for companies that make the announcement three months out
5845208 we need one captain with a big personality in every moment an observation unlikely to lift the spirits of a devastated ferdinand
5845209 its not an easy choice because rio ferdinand is a very important player and i like him as a captain added capello seeking if failing to soften the blow
5845210 the captain cannot play if he is limping but no one is untouchable the fact someone is captain does not make him undroppable
5845211 forward step in every one of his four games was met with raised eyebrows
5845212 i want to see england play like a team with spirit and without fear with big personality
5845213 he fit a whole life in 48 years of his life
5845214 well be looking at the engine and airplane frame with manufacturer representatives
5845215 when i think of my father instead of mourning him i will honor him by emulating him
5845216 the ut3 linux client most definitely is progressing albeit a lot slower than we anticipated we dont discuss the status of patches until we know theyre ready to be released
5845217 i think its likely that when were getting close well release it to the ut3 servers and mods mailing lists for semi open public testing
5845218 when were close to release ill be sure to drop everyone here a line
5845219 after careful consideration our board rejected the offer after concluding that their proposal was not in the best interest of our stockholders the board believes the 5 25 offering price does not reflect the value of heelys and that entering into discussions with skechers based on their unsolicited proposal is premature at this time

5845222 in the trying times of these last six years florence county has persevered to enhance not only our economic viability but also our tourism capabilities
5845223 it really does make a nice package no question about it
5845224 it looks nice here and people feel safe and secure when they stay here
5845225 i think its important for us to build an identity and have attractions that bring people in
5845226 mets go to turner field and get rear ends kicked
5845227 education is learning what you didnt even know you didnt know
5845228 we would like to see the vat regime reformed so that products that have a long life cycle or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced are made economically more attractive
5845229 this would be an important step in turning away from the throwaway consumer culture we currently have
5845230 manufacturers who behave irresponsibly face financial consequences and those who are doing the right thing are supported
5845231 theres a much shorter payback period with the 1bog rebate
5845232 we definitely have a lot of work ahead of us
5845233 but right now our priority is to complete the san francisco campaign to have a proof of concept
5845234 it was very painful the fact that you have someone telling you they will not help you because of who you are that they will deny your right to be a mother and have a family
5845235 it was clear and emphatic that discrimination has no place in doctors offices
5845236 the supreme courts desire to promote the homosexual lifestyle at the risk of infringing upon the first amendment right to free exercise of religion is what the public needs to learn about
5845237 we would like to see the vat regime reformed so that products that have a long life cycle or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced are made economically more attractive
5845238 this would be an important step in turning away from the throwaway consumer culture we currently have
5845239 manufacturers who behave irresponsibly face financial consequences and those who are doing the right thing are supported
5845240 it was one of those nights when i wore a super tight dress that you couldnt have worn anything under since it would have showed the paparazzi were literally lowering their cameras like speculums when i got out of the car
5845241 on the way home i said to my husband darling i think they might have gotten it and so when we pulled in i made him re enact the thing with his camera a sort of crime scene run through it appears i survived unscathed
5845242 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5845243 big cats and dinosaurs if you see any of those give us a call
5845244 in the current economic condition people are driving less and it obviously affects every facet of the u s auto industry including how often they replace tires or buy new cars
5845245 the current economic condition further impacted the stores but they were not performing well before this year and we dont expect them to perform well
5845246 mccain the candidate who will say anything to get elected
5845247 people need to understand much of the electorate decides very late in the game in other words im not concerned with polls
5845248 is he really so arrogant to think he doesnt need to refute these claims
5845249 the only other possibility that exists is someone who went down there who didnt sign up
5845250 we are not a technology company instead we are a media startup that is using technology to figure out the future of our business wherever it might head up
5845251 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5845252 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5845253 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5845254 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the
5845255 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5845256 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5845257 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5845258 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5845259 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5845260 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
5845261 you will need to be able to copy the look and style of both authors signatures
5845262 this is a great opportunity for denver and colorado to showcase our green accomplishments and innovations and we are delighted to add such dynamic speakers to the green frontier fest lineup
5845263 an enduring legacy project for our community and visitors this event will create public awareness that lasts well beyond the convention week
5845264 the new energy station and green frontier fest are just two examples of our commitment to make this convention the greenest possible
5845265 were fortunate to have so many great new energy organizations willing to come together to enlighten the public about the technology products and services available for greener living the technologies being displayed at new energy station are integral parts in the future economic development of denver colorado and the nation

5845270 theres a lot of things that can be done and need to be done in the city and its been nice to have good things said about you
5845271 if he should choose to run i think hed be a strong candidate
5845272 i had very good relations with him as governor and there was never an attempt to politicize the work we did
5845273 i would not consider frosted flakes the food of an olympian
5845274 i would rather see him promoting fiber one i would rather see him promoting oatmeal i would even rather see him promoting cheerios
5845275 for a guy like michael phelps who isnt worried about obesity because hes burning thousands of calories as an athlete eating corn flakes and frosted flakes every so often is not an issue
5845276 it could be another i hate to use the expression nail in the coffin referring to the countrys credit crisis as an original cds can go through 15 to 20 trades such that
5845277 to give you a true picture of just how bad inflation has become here is what john williams of in his latest newsletter
5845278 the sgs alternate consumer inflation measure which reverses gimmicked changes to official cpi reporting methodologies back to 1980 rose to a 28 year high of roughly 13 4 in july up from 12 6 in june
5845279 the global financial system seems to have a black hole at its centre over the last two decades us residents have sold a total of about 5 500bn worth of ious to foreigners yet the officially recorded net investment position of the us has deteriorated only by a little more than half of this amount 2 800bn the us capital market seems to have acted like a black hole for investors from the rest of world in which 2 700bn vanished from sight or at least from the official statistics
5845280 the federal reserve will do what it takes to maintain its credibility which is central to preserving the integrity of the us dollar
5845281 we seek to get it right and the answer to your question is we will do what gets it right
5845282 i believe a working prototype could be made but it would take a great deal of time and engineering
5845283 its a green vehicle and all of the numbers are based in the real world
5845284 i commissioned 26 photographers designers and new media artists to embrace this more than 20 year old technology they were given only 3 days to work on their projects and were encouraged though not required to incorporate photographic materials some had never made an animated gif before and some were notorious for it
5845285 claudio died in his mothers arms with think from some heart defect
5845286 on wednesday he gave the impression to keepers that he wasnt feeling too well
5845287 on friday he wasnt eating or drinking properly and seemed to be growing weaker
5845288 we were keeping a close eye on him but suddenly on saturday morning he died
5845289 in the wild a gorilla mother can keep hold of a dead baby for weeks
5845290 we will carry out an autopsy on the body when we can
5845291 we are potentially able to more accurately predict who would benefit from chemotherapy
5845292 we then found that patients with tumour tissue which also carried lamin a were more likely to have an aggressive form of the disease
5845293 we now aim to carry out more work in this area to develop a prognostic tool which we hope will eventually be for widespread use by the health services in the treatment of bowel cancer
5845294 chemotherapy can be very useful but can have a number of side effects so we only want to use it where we think theres a good chance it will help this test will help us determine that
5845295 there is a desperate need for more effective treatments for bowel cancer
5845296 this discrepancy may have profound consequences on the ability of species to cope with climate change in the long run
5845297 the calf has spent the last day or so in pittwater and we believe it has been nuzzling up to a moored vessel in an attempt to find milk
5845298 the best thing we can do is to shepherd the animal and hope it remains in the ocean
5845299 they saw the artificial lights and took the wrong route
5845300 the diners were at first quite curious and then someone alerted the coastal authorities
5845301 the facial structure of a man provides an indication of how aggressive he will be in a competitive situation
5845302 therefore we are able to predict with some accuracy the behaviour of men on the basis of their facial features
5845303 if mens faces are providing cues as to their potential for aggression then likely people are probably picking up on this cue although likely on a subconscious level
5845304 together these findings suggest that people can make accurate inferences about others personality traits and behavioural dispositions based on certain signals conveyed by the face
5845305 given that people readily make judgements of others based on their looks and that we have evidence that the face may actually be providing relevant information it will be fascinating to see if peoples judgements of faces are accurate
5845306 he is a freak and the sooner he goes away the better
5845307 i have observed all the local dolphins over a number of years and have watched billie occasionally performing tail walks in the years since her release sometimes in the bow wave of large ships which is an awesome sight
5845308 about five years ago another female dolphin called wave began performing the same behaviour but does so with much greater regularity than billie a third adult female dolphin has also been seen tail walking
5845309 if tail walking is a true cultural behaviour it will gradually spread through the local population probably by being adopted by youngsters
5845310 wdcs will maintain its quiet non invasive observations of these enigmatic animals and continue to document the behaviour of these wild free dolphins
5845311 these are things that groups develop and are passed between individuals and that come to define those groups such as language or dancing and it would seem that among the port river dolphins we may have an incipient tail walking culture
5845312 the princes favourite issues are countryside related and hes prepared to stand up for what he thinks
5845313 i think were well beyond the time when he was castigated for talking to his plants
5845314 he genuinely feels very passionately and strongly hes a real countryman and its great that the populace realises that the countryside hasnt had many champions
5845315 this technique is really the first time that cancer surgeons can see structures that are otherwise invisible
5845316 if were able to see cancer we have a chance of curing it
5845317 building in green areas for 5 000 to 10 000 people has to be car based it goes against everything we know about sustainability
5845318 the one certainty is that confusion reigns at the heart of labours controversial eco town project
5845319 we do not claim that the findings demonstrate a level of self consciousness or self reflection typical of humans
5845320 the findings do however show that magpies respond in the mirror and mark test in a manner so far only clearly found in apes and at least suggestively in dolphins and elephants
5845321 had no choice but to enter into the settlement in order to avoid further incarceration
5845322 if this stands this single handedly undermines the entire civil judicial process in this country
5845323 he always told me that he thought school was a waste of time
5845324 pc tools is a global leader in innovative software products designed to protect the privacy and security of windows computer users
5845325 that would be pure speculation i think that would be easy to fall back on and point fingers id prefer to take the high road and stay away from that
5845326 its something that happens over a long period of time
5845327 to be honest with you i did not particularly see this coming but im not totally shot out of the water by it i understand the background and how many innings hes pitched
5845328 i dont think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out what a central figure hes been on our ballclub trembley said
5845329 it is always good to go out of these kinds of matches with a win i am happy physically because i am fine coming out of this match
5845330 i am definitely thinking the body is not holding as well as it used to mauresmo said
5845331 thats a fact and it is pretty frustrating but that is the way it is
5845332 this could be for me an opportunity to get back into the highest level mauresmo said
5845333 it is going to be a matter of really taking the opportunities if they show up
5845334 the 2009 schedule reflects realigned dates that are good opportunities for everyone involved in our sport fans sponsors tracks and teams nascar president mike helton said
5845335 the 2009 schedule is a victory for race fans said gillian zucker president of auto club speedway
5845336 from a weather standpoint i can hardly think of a better time to visit california than early october and we look forward to being part of the championship puzzle
5845337 weve been desiring a night race in atlanta for a number of years
5845338 were bringing labor day racing back to the southeast and doing it with a nighttime event its a win win win situation for everybody
5845339 weve been a big part of the championship battle and we believe that moving even deeper into the chase makes talladega even more significant to the championship humphrey said
5845340 also by moving to the end of october coupled with atlantas new date that separates our two events which is very beneficial for both parties
5845341 seating is a real hot topic right now wallace said
5845342 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice
5845343 hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
5845344 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5845345 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that
5845346 he slept on his arm the other night and he came in and felt some tingling in his fingertips
5845347 as far as pain goes its not that much pain at all with it its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered until now
5845348 he came to my house and basically was talking about how to peak how to go to a big time event and produce your best performance harrington said tuesday at the barclays
5845349 he was obviously a very talented competitor himself and knew what to do but was feeling that he was slightly underachieving at the big events
5845350 the only way to learn experience without actually going through it yourself is learn from somebody else harrington said
5845351 kenny was not afraid to ask a couple of people to make the contact with me and i love to talk so i was more than obliging
5845352 the following day they went out and lost to carlow which is one of the favorite teams losing to one of the lower down teams so it was a bit of an upset harrington said
5845353 i wouldnt say i have a 100 percent record in these things but it is great to see kenny doing so well
5845354 hopefully i can make the team if i can play well here this week and next week pettersson said
5845355 id like to make the team outright i still think i need to play well this week and next week to get a pick i would like to qualify on my own terms
5845356 ive done it in europe and it would be very nice to do it in the states said harrington who won the order of merit in 2006
5845357 they want greg normans and fred couples and tiger woods they dont want guys youve never heard of
5845358 its supposed to be a human sport yet theres equestrians going on there i think golf would be a great thing for the olympics
5845359 when i do get focused i do hole putts padraig harrington
5845360 as far as practice today i thought the quarterback was very good from the beginning of practice through the end he was really throwing the ball extremely well he was throwing against the wind most of the day too so we feel real good about where he is
5845361 i think its an example of two guys who havent missed one offseason workout theyve been out here on their own throwing thousands of passes to each other and it shows
5845362 ive never seen a quarterback like him with his kind of arm
5845363 hes calm cool and doesnt get flustered hes always on to the next play
5845364 you have to know the ball is going to get on you quick
5845365 at first i thought the ball rose it came so hard but its so much easier to catch now i dont know if hes changed anything or im used to the speed of the ball but all you need to do is make sure you get your eyes around and have fresh gloves
5845366 there was one play in offseason workouts where he stepped up saw something he liked and threw a 30 yard strike on an all go
5845367 i remember looking back and as soon as i got my hands up it was into my chest i caught it but it was on me so quick i couldnt believe it you try to catch with your hands but it still gets right through them to your pads
5845368 he took me under his wing when i was staying at the hotel during offseason training in may where i was sitting there looking at all four walls wed just hang out and chill
5845369 its just like any other teammate when you come in young you need people to be around to feel comfortable outside of football
5845370 he didnt have to be in the hotel for so long i brought him up there to let him know he was family we didnt really talk about football i just took him up there to let him be himself and chill out
5845371 we have 12 players ready to step on the court
5845372 it sounds corny but youre only as strong as your weakest link
5845373 we learned a lot from that loss were not going to take anything for granted
5845374 when you wear that usa jersey a lot is expected
5845375 theres no words to convey how sorry how incredibly sorry i am
5845376 truly a parents worst nightmare we send our children to school to be safe to respect their teachers
5845377 took the love and respect of his students and used it for his own purposes and made it something ugly
5845378 separated for the moment no plans for divorce at this time
5845379 my expectations are to beat the patriots at least once and make the playoffs i think that the bills have a good shot at both
5845380 i was thrown into the fire the third week of the season against the new england patriots
5845381 and guys are walking up and down the sidelines saying trent youre ready to go youre ready to go its your time
5845382 but i had taken two snaps that week tom brady is on the other sidelines and junior seau is at linebacker it was like i dont know
5845383 there were times at stanford where you faced reggie bush and matt leinart in prime time television at the l a coliseum and we never even came close to beating usc those lessons in adversity built up over the years helped me get through last year
5845384 but also there are lessons i hadnt faced in my entire life like picking up and leaving your family when youve lived in the same area 23 years of your life and getting drafted to a cold weather city like buffalo youve got to adjust to it on the fly
5845385 were going to do what i like to do and what fits our players
5845386 im sure there will be some differences in what we did last year anytime you change play callers its going to look different even if you have the exact same offense because your thought process is different how you call plays is different and so is what you like in certain situations
5845387 wed like to dictate a little more to the defenses than we did a year ago
5845388 and because were more experienced we may be able to do it wed like to change pace on people as we move through the year with different tempo and tempo is the best way to describe it
5845389 of course well have to wait and see how trent handles everything but were optimistic that he can
5845390 should make a difference because hes added some dimensions that werent there before hes given the offense more freedom
5845391 what it really is going to boil down to is decision making especially at the quarterback position and that plays right to trents strength because hes a smart cerebral guy
5845392 id like to find out what our guys do best and then do it and do it consistently
5845393 im not a big believer in beating people with calls i think you beat them with people and then execution once you have enough skill accumulated let them play
5845394 he donnan probably asked me about jobs his first year here
5845395 this involvement preceded the tenure of the current head football coach
5845396 when donnan made this request the only difference is you are trading white kids for black kids
5845397 jim donnan and bobby pruett are first class human beings and essentially have done an awful lot of things to help youngsters
5845398 we are reaching out to the hollywood community to do what we can to ensure their safety and security
5845399 colorado and the west are both a big focus of this campaign
5845400 that investment and the energy that we see on the ground in new mexico will absolutely translate in november
5845401 in a place like montana there simply werent the resources to keep a party headquarters opened during the entire year in non election years and so it was very difficult
5845402 it kept people on the ground recruiting new candidates maintaining voter files making sure we have county committees that are working and organised
5845403 the government not telling you how to live your life and what to do
5845404 fellow countrymen with deep sorrow and grief i would like to inform the people of zambia that our president dr levy patrick mwanawasa died this morning at 10 30 hours
5845405 i also wish to inform the nation that national mourning starts today and will be for seven days
5845406 died supporting his own men he has helped to save the lives of many afghan soldiers and civilians alike
5845407 barry was a devoted husband and father he has died doing a job he loved his family and the army was his life he will be forever missed by his wife children and family he will never be forgotten he died a hero
5845408 during that time an improvised explosive device was detonated which resulted in the death of cpl dempsey and shrapnel and blast injuries to one other isaf international security assistance force an afghan national army soldier and the patrol interpreter
5845409 people who have been part of a war that i consider immoral and illegal still have more legitimacy than people who were against the war from the very beginning and refused to fight in it
5845410 they command more of a sense of authority and more of a sense of understanding of whats actually happening on the ground generals who come out against the war are seen as more important even than congress members who are against the war
5845411 when youre coming out of the military the one thing that you lose bigger than anything else is the camaraderie of your unit
5845412 youve got family youve got friends but you dont have the people who have been there and thats a huge thing in this community we have that whether they want to live here or they want to stay a weekend or they just want to come over and watch some tv for a little while its just a space for veterans
5845413 our military is trained to kill people and were the bullies
5845414 i didnt sign up in the military to be a bully i signed up to protect people from bullies we started to talk about iraq and iraq just didnt pass the smell test
5845415 i thought that if i resisted they would put me in jail
5845416 most of us were ncos in the military so were good at telling people to clean up shit
5845417 the ptsd is so thick in the air you can cut it with a knife
5845418 i had been seeing a girl for about two weeks at the time and she was here and that ended that relationship
5845419 they let me flare up like that and they gave me that space and then as i naturally came down of that i was able to say im sorry i was not thinking naturally
5845420 if i have a conversation with a kid in high school and he decides hes not going to join the military thats a direct action
5845421 a war resister inside the military is both but that doesnt necessarily make it more effective i would rather have 1 000 high school students who would otherwise not join than one person within the military resist thats taking 1 000 bodies out of the system as opposed to taking one out
5845422 im kind of an anxious person im kind of antsy i have a lot of quirks that make people uncomfortable but being around cats like this its second nature nobody really notices it
5845423 theres a certain environment that were able to create here that is distinctly for veterans who have the freedom of mind to see that theyve been lied to that essentially a certain element of their service was for nothing
5845424 an environment that empowers them to live out their convictions
5845425 i want to see anyone who poses a threat to our children dealt with as firmly as possible
5845426 ive spoken to child protection experts and the police and they have told me that these changes will further restrict the ability of child sex offenders to harm children both here and overseas
5845427 we are concerned that current travel prevention orders designed to prevent offenders from going overseas are not working hardly any have been issued against sex offenders in the past five years
5845428 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
5845429 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world i want gary glitter to be controlled while hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5845430 it was dreadful really dreadful one minute they were all laughing and squirting each other with water pistols it was a long straight stretch of road and the tractor had broken down at the side
5845431 we didnt see it happen but we were told that the driver a young lad was squirted with water which temporarily blinded him
5845432 four jeeps went out on the safari three of them had passed the broken down tractor but as the fourth jeep came down the road a german motorbike tourist thought hed join in the fun and threw water at the jeep
5845433 it hit the driver in the face and temporarily blinded him he swerved to avoid the tractor but the back of our vehicle hit the tractors trailer and the passengers were thrown out
5845434 it is all too soon and still raw at the moment to say anything else
5845435 we can confirm that two british nationals died and seven were injured in a road traffic accident whilst on a jeep safari in turkey yesterday
5845436 whats particularly worrying is that huge amounts of the food and cotton we consume are grown in drier areas of the world where water resources are either already stressed or very likely to become so in the near future
5845437 we are already in discussion with wwf about our decisions about where to grow crops in the future
5845438 from our point of view weve got to look at where our growers are going to get their water from
5845439 there are massive challenges with water in places like murcia southern spain we have to look at least 10 years ahead in terms of security of supply murcia will have to look very different in five years time
5845440 well have to look at new desalination technologies and we may have to look at crops that can cope with more saline conditions such as broccoli we take tomatoes out of morocco in winter and weve looked very hard at moroccan water but its complex if you use more greenhouse production here it uses more energy peas and beans are a steady all year market weve got to think about how we get them here in a responsible manner
5845441 kenny is going to be the best in the world
5845442 there was so much expectation and its been a really hard five days of racing but then you cross the finish and its all over and youve won it makes everything worthwhile all the sacrifices all the hard work
5845443 but we knew if we performed wed be really hard to beat
5845444 i knew i could not have worked any harder if somebody was going to beat me they were going to have to do something pretty special and if they had i would have shaken their hand knowing i had given everything
5845445 the mission is clear were not involved in promoting cycling or anything like that our job is to win medals we remember that all the time and everything we do is built around that objective
5845446 the attention to detail the hard work the great people we have the hours we put in on the track or in the wind tunnel everything starts from that clear mission
5845447 our job is easy we just ride our bikes they look after everything else
5845448 chris hoy is a legend hes my hero and hes even more of a legend now
5845449 we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is a recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness isnt there a fairytale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
5845450 to be honest there just arent top quality men here
5845451 they are too busy drinking xxxx to notice the women and all they do is whistle or yell or beep as you go past those sorts of communication skills which i just love
5845452 weve got a saying up here the odds are good but the goods are odd
5845453 if you hate men we want to see photos of you in sexy lingerie
5845454 the barriers to womens full and equal participation in the paid workforce are real
5845455 we seem to allow some of our male politicians to be aggressive and pushy
5845456 its exhausting for me her being pregnant i dont know why during the birth process they only focus on the women what about the men standing there
5845457 come back when your iq is as high as your skirt
5845458 constantly asked why australian men say these kinds of things but british men and american men and men all around the world say them too
5845459 everyone will understand why liu xiang had to abandon competition
5845460 we hope he will relax and focus on recovery we hope that after he recovers he will continue to train hard and struggle harder for the national glory
5845461 theres so many people concerned about me and who support me i feel very sorry
5845462 they only work four and a half days each week every day there are two coffee breaks there cannot be any discomfort because of human rights
5845463 you could not criticise them either they have all kind of institutions unions
5845464 had the highest level of political review since the founding of the peoples republic of china basically all reviews were from the central committee level
5845465 severe threat to the safety of planes coming out of the airport
5845466 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
5845467 whether it is automobile emissions reduction or construction site dust reduction or coal pollution reduction i believe that the requirements will be more stringent
5845468 its a place primarily for dogs not people and we hope they have a nice time there
5845469 there is a lot of hostility towards dogs on this island and its part of a mentality that goes back years
5845470 very often youll see fights erupt between people who take their little dogs to beaches and other residents who just cant stand them being there animal rights are such that you will also see dogs being poisoned
5845471 brian i dont know what ill do if tarique becomes my deputy
5845472 i dont think it is something ian blair has ever forgotten
5845473 it was a devastating blow to the case ian blair was utterly furious with tarique he had no notice tarique would do that and it was clearly damaging it was at a critical time when blair was launching his bid for commissioner
5845474 he delivered excellent results he did in the end win people round
5845475 it would be seen as directly attacking the authority of the commissioner and cabinet collective responsibility
5845476 he came very close to not having his contract renewed
5845477 by the time he arrived at the unit he was already in the last chance saloon
5845478 tarique has added value to the force but hes reached his limit and does not realise that i realise that ive reached my limit hes brilliant at some things but just doesnt realise his weaknesses
5845479 the effect will be disastrous it represents a real setback for their race equality efforts internally
5845480 weve been on this path for the last few years
5845481 theres no doubt this year has seen some very very bold changes necessarily so and entirely reflective of what our buyers and sellers want
5845482 i dont think anything can surpass ebay in terms of choice but e commerce is now mainstream we see our competitive set as a broad one anywhere where a buyer can buy stuff online that might be amazon or the more traditional bricks and clicks but the big advantage we have is choice mums sitting alongside entrepreneurs sitting alongside big retailers
5845483 i think theres room for everybody at the end of the day having big brands on there helps legitimise ebay as a marketplace having big retailers on there makes it more exciting as a buying experience
5845484 we hope to see significant increase in the choice our sellers give to buyers
5845485 if you are a buyer and searching on ebay youll have far more chance of finding what you are looking for in a credit crunch environment its far easier to shop around online for a bargain than it is offline
5845486 any change to the site that benefits one seller automatically disadvantages others the sellers who are disadvantaged will always shout the loudest
5845487 ebay has realised there is quite a lot of fear among sellers
5845488 they are realising that sellers are ebay customers too and listening to their customers
5845489 people forget the internet has changed when ebay started out a lot was taken on trust and people were sending envelopes stuffed with dollars across the atlantic now with instant payments buyers are expecting better service and almost instant delivery
5845490 if ebay doesnt take steps to ensure its sellers are providing the right level of service and customer satisfaction it will fail buyers will go to amazon or argos instead amazon is doing really well and sellers are flocking to amazon you can buy almost anything on ebay the challenge is to make sure you can carry on doing that and maintain a good level of service its a hard tightrope to walk
5845491 que se mencionaban al principio son los m s afectados llegan a un sal n que no conocen no saben bien a bien d nde est la tiendita los ba os qui n es la miss
5845492 y as darse a conocer bajo el escrutinio de decenas de miradas que s lo est n buscando ese deseado equ voco que les va a dar el apodo perfecto para ese pobre o esa pobre que busca desesperadamente el sentido de pertenencia
5845493 result ser que nuestros pap s se conoc an el sr
5845494 i recognised that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
5845495 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5845496 the amount of fail on theforum com is reaching epic proportions
5845497 need to submit their distillates to a series of tests regulations and technical requirements that have been created for health safety i believe that the distillers association will have something to say in this matter
5845498 i have a bmw parked just down the hill im not short of money i could have afforded a hotel why am i here
5845499 we lead such non elemental lives this makes life elemental again
5845500 you sound more interesting than some slob whos been topping up his tan
5845501 it was dreadful really dreadful one minute they were all laughing and squirting each other with water pistols it was a long straight stretch of road and the tractor had broken down at the side
5845502 we didnt see it happen but we were told that the driver a young lad was squirted with water which temporarily blinded him

5845506 we can confirm that two british nationals died and seven were injured in a road traffic accident whilst on a jeep safari in turkey yesterday
5845507 the positions can be full time or half time and are to be appointed by the republican committee people if at all possible
5845508 it creates a cloud in an office that cant afford to have one
5845509 she just made a quantum leap unfortunately that said because there are two republicans and one democrat and those folks make the decisions it should be a republican
5845510 in this instance i probably could have used a better choice of words and i probably should have used the word recommend
5845511 the committee people make recommendations to our office but the board of elections ultimately approves the machine inspector appointments
5845512 my main concern is just having adequate staffing for a smooth election
5845513 how about having a discussion and including the minority commissioner
5845514 please note that question 27 on page 242 and its associated answer on page 244 are incorrect mr blunkett declared his directorship and shareholding in dna bioscience fully and as required by the ministerial code of conduct
5845515 i think we are moving from a period when if you like celebrity matters
5845516 er i dont mean the kind of people you put in your magazine obviously i mean those people who are famous only for being on tv
5845517 id start going to the gym and eating brocolli if i thought it made any difference
5845518 live long die young answer isnt just in the genes
5845519 i hope that the people of california will hang the albatross of bad health care around the governors neck
5845520 every time you pick up a salt shaker you shorten your life by five minutes
5845521 we have been using 100 canola oil for 20 years because it has a better taste and is better off for the customers its easy to replace artificial trans fat it costs the same and the food tastes great our cakes and other baked goods are already trans fat free if we can do it so can other restaurants
5845522 if new yorkers replace all sources of artificial trans fat by even the most conservative estimates at least 500 deaths from heart disease would be prevented each year in new york city more than the number of people killed annually in motor vehicle crashes
5845523 dogs dont have can openers they cant open up the refrigerator its not their fault
5845524 hey dude will you pretty please tell your party bosses to quit putting poison in the food you export overseas
5845525 they wont ever find me six days in jail was unbearable for me

5845527 we feel for the pakistan cricket board and the people of pakistan but it is the job of the aca to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour
5845528 unfortunately in this case we dont believe it is safe
5845529 we have all got concerns i do know what karachi can be like having grown up there

5845532 an organic life of holistic therapies and private training sessions in a multimillion pound house with just a couple of small filipinas chained up in the basement it was about having slate solar panels to heat your london home as well as an eight bedroom spread in shropshire about having your hair shirt never too far from your helmut lang in your walk in cupboard

5845534 i didnt have david cameron in my head but i was pitilessly photographing for the page what is my milieus experience of country living from having the aga to owning the right boot rack i wanted to show exactly how things look the conservatives are very materialistic and they dress this up with their greenness but its just a new form of consumerism all these things are status symbols like liz hurleys gloucester old spot pigs the countryside has given people a larger canvas to display their wonderfulness
5845535 its a show off thing it allows them to say we come from the soil and of course the shires are all tory labour has done brilliantly in bringing out sleepy rural communities to a greater level of activism
5845536 im the death knell to every trend with this massive recession looming shire hell may already be an anachronism notting hill ended with a great jolt with people losing their jobs in the city its not cool to flash it about so much now ive heard people saying they wont take their chef in the yacht this summer and that they will have to cut back from four to two polo ponies thrift is the new chic
5845537 a very simple but comfortable house there are gillies and people stalking
5845538 are dear to cameron he brilliantly combines the new green and the old tories
5845539 but i dont think he will because it would lose them votes in the cities and thats going to be a critical thing for him
5845540 the whole thing of sex in the city is a great myth
5845541 rugby shirts tucked into fractionally too tight high waisted jeans
5845542 following constructive discussions with the rmt today we have been able to agree in principle a two year deal that will satisfy all parties
5845543 people across the country not just in london can see for themselves that after just three months the new tory administration in london is in complete disarray
5845544 the mayor of london has been frank in his opposition to his leaders claim which has always been the most cynical nonsense
5845545 in doing so he has signalled that at least one senior conservative is fed up of david cameron running britain down
5845546 if youre going to take very important political decisions about london transport its absolutely vital the mayor chairs tfl and tim parker agrees with me that thats the way forward
5845547 his exit after just a couple of months in fact confirms the chaos which has existed in boris johnsons administration since day one
5845548 please note that question 27 on page 242 and its associated answer on page 244 are incorrect mr blunkett declared his directorship and shareholding in dna bioscience fully and as required by the ministerial code of conduct

5845551 brian i dont know what ill do if tarique becomes my deputy
5845552 i dont think it is something ian blair has ever forgotten
5845553 it was a devastating blow to the case ian blair was utterly furious with tarique he had no notice tarique would do that and it was clearly damaging it was at a critical time when blair was launching his bid for commissioner
5845554 he delivered excellent results he did in the end win people round
5845555 it would be seen as directly attacking the authority of the commissioner and cabinet collective responsibility
5845556 he came very close to not having his contract renewed
5845557 by the time he arrived at the unit he was already in the last chance saloon
5845558 tarique has added value to the force but hes reached his limit and does not realise that i realise that ive reached my limit hes brilliant at some things but just doesnt realise his weaknesses
5845559 the effect will be disastrous it represents a real setback for their race equality efforts internally
5845560 we know that redistribution alone as the sole policy tool to tackle poverty has failed
5845561 there are 900 000 more people in severe poverty than in 1997 and child poverty has been rising for two years in succession
5845562 that approach is failing because it relies on a flawed assumption that only the state can guarantee fairness

5845573 one addict for every two hundred and fifty citizens this not only gives vancouver the highest rate of drug addiction in the western hemisphere

5845575 allochtonen die een goede taalbeheersing hebben en veel sociale contacten onderhouden met autochtonen zijn slanker dan allochtonen die slecht nederlands spreken en alleen met andere allochtonen omgaan
5845576 misschien verschuift het schoonheidsideaal van goed ge ntegreerde allochtonen van vol wat in veel niet westerse landen als welvarend en dus mooi wordt beschouwd naar slank het zou ook kunnen dat ge ntegreerde allochtonen zon druk leven hebben dat ze geen tijd meer hebben om veel aandacht te besteden aan het eten zoals hun ouders dat waarschijnlijk wel deden geen uitgebreide maaltijden waarbij de ene na de andere schotel wordt neergezet
5845577 het aandeel oudere turken en marokkanen met ernstig overgewicht is zorgwekkend hoog
5845578 dat heeft niet alleen te maken met weinig bewegen en ongezond eten bij deze groep spelen ook psychische klachten een rol ze hebben vaak een kleine leefwereld werken niet meer en hebben heimwee naar hun geboorteland
5845579 zweten en een verhoogde hartslag worden soms als voorbode van een ernstige aandoening gezien je kunt erom lachen maar als je nooit hebt gesport weet je niet dat dat erbij hoort vooral oudere marokkaanse en turkse vrouwen vinden het eng zij hebben vaak last van hun gewrichten en kampen met diabetes en hart en vaatziekten als gevolg van overgewicht
5845580 wat is er een nederlandse cameraman omgekomen maar wat deed hij dan ook in zuid osseti dat is toch veel te gevaarlijk wat hij was in georgi maar daar zijn toch helemaal geen bommen gevallen
5845581 de georgische autoriteiten cre erden bewust een beeld van rusland als agressor russische officials hadden de mogelijkheid om de aandacht te krijgen van het westen maar die werd niet gebruikt
5845582 het re ntegratiebeleid is sterk gericht op de kortste weg naar werk
5845583 het idee ontstaat dat dit met de retourtjes voor de reiziger slecht uitpakt
5845584 daarmee voldoet de ov chipkaart niet aan onze belangrijkste eis namelijk dat reizen door de ov chip niet duurder mag worden
5845585 dat de ns er netto niets extras aan overhouden is mogelijk maar dat neemt niet weg dat veel reizigers straks wel echt duurder uit zijn als je dit met droge ogen goedkeurt houdt de discussie voor ons op hier moet gewoon een streep door
5845586 wij vinden het onbestaanbaar dat de chipkaart tot een duurder retourtje leidt
5845587 soms heb ik het idee dat ik zo intensief geleefd heb omdat ik wist wat er zou gebeuren

5845591 bij vernieuwing van de dijken kunnen we de waterwerken zo aanpassen dat het water in de zomer hoger kan staan
5845592 dat gebeurt nu met water dat aan de hoge eisen van drinkwater voldoet
5845593 er zijn veel manieren om het watertekort aan te pakken
5845594 de kosten van aanpassingen tijdens de bouw staan in geen verhouding tot de schade die wordt voorkomen
5845595 door bijvoorbeeld meer zwarte grond op de tuin te gooien wordt meer water vastgehouden
5845596 boeren zouden bijvoorbeeld kunnen proberen om in natte periodes meer water vast te houden of kunnen overgaan op andere gewassen
5845597 er is een spanningsveld tussen de overheid en de woningco peraties bouwverenigingen zijn niet ge nteresseerd omdat de woningen duurder worden en daardoor minder aantrekkelijk zijn voor de consument
5845598 we moeten nu de mogelijkheden onderzoeken zeker is dat we serieus rekening moeten houden met een watertekort maar hoe het klimaat zich precies ontwikkelt weten we niet het blijft spreken over kansen
5845599 er moet bijvoorbeeld een veiling in de buurt komen en voor dat soort maatregelen is het te vroeg een nieuwe droge zomer geeft uiteindelijk de doorslag

5845607 het ergste was dat ik tien maanden zat opgesloten met een gestoorde vrouw
5845608 bijvoorbeeld toen ik preekte op de trappen voor de grote kathedraal in de hoofdstad asmara het ethiopische leger had ons net weer aangevallen en mensen wilden wraak ik riep op om naar god terug te keren het is vreselijk als er bloed vloeit
5845609 het is heel gevaarlijk ja maar mijn geloof is zo diep dat ik bereid ben ervoor te sterven
5845610 ik antwoordde dat het niet met mij begonnen is ja ik heb overal een antwoord op dat klopt dat was moeilijk voor mijn ouders maar mijn vader onderdrukte me niet

5845620 a common misconception is that regular people dont buy from spam but you have to consider the types of products people are buying
5845621 its pirated software knock off watches counterfeit designer goods cheap drugs and prescription medicines pornography and other adult material the internet provides convenience and a degree of anonymity to people who want to buy illegal or restricted goods it is a black market and spam has become a conventional means of advertising to a willing audience of millions of people who are purchasing from spam
5845622 the other way to look at this situation is from a spammers perspective there are approximately 250 million people out there who are interested in these kinds of products and have made purchases from spam in the past thats equivalent to double the population of japan mixed in with every other internet user as a spammer how do you reach that market without knowing specifically who these people are and with the bare minimum of expense easy send lots of emails to everyone

5845627 something very pirandello like the actors get inside their characters and talk among themselves with the only information to which they have access that is what i give them in the script as well as being fun its a very good exercise for feeling that you are the other
5845628 weve finished the ninth week of shooting these days we are tackling the darkest part of the film the film touches on many genres this week its the thriller i admit that in recent years ive had a weakness for this genre and for the western but i wouldnt know how to come to grips with a western
5845629 at the end when the characters of jeanne moreau and her unfortunate lover maurice ronet are cornered condemned to live in different prisons some photos appear of the couple in their good moments embracing
5845630 jeanne moreaus voiceover talks of those photographed embraces as something eternal something that no one will be able to break and that will remain forever while she will waste away in prison my next film broken embraces talks about that kind of embrace

5845636 experts are telling us that the profile of fans that follow pete doherty and babyshambles is volatile and they can easily be whipped up into a frenzy whereas the profile of someone that would follow around cliff richard or bucks fizz for example is completely different
5845637 we carried out an analysis of what pete doherty and his band does what he does as part of his routine is to gee up the crowd
5845638 they speed up and then slow down the music and create a whirlpool effect in the crowd they the crowd all get geed up and then they start fighting

5845649 my secret my shared secret with the director jonathan levine and sometimes you have to have them was exactly that im playing the child
5845650 and that was my message to myself throughout the shoot
5845651 youre absolutely right it must happen that ah moment youve got to have it im sure painters have it theyre working away on a canvas and suddenly they go ah there it is certainly i knew i wanted squires to have his brain coming out through his scalp so i knew hed need to have hair because this
5845652 at that point i thought well i cant quite see the portrait yet but theres something there yes
5845653 but it really happened when we shot the first scene josh is in my office he says do you want me to lie on the couch or anything and the way he said it left me no choice but to reply do do you want to lie on the couch i realised that everything this man does is for the first time that was the first little breath of ah that i found
5845654 yes its a love story i think iago is in love with othello and i think don loves gal loves him like a soldier loves a general these dynamics to me are everything theres no film without them
5845655 three or four years ago i realized there was a demon i needed to be face to face with so that i could say you can go now thank you you can go i felt this shift something had been clinging on some demon was sitting over me with a knife and fork ready to eat me every day
5845656 the other way around the demons left then the happiness came
5845657 im surprised i cant because i know im warmer more embracing i find my emotional triggers are closer to the surface easier to reach i dont have to dig too deep between action and cut its right there
5845658 every gallery here was stacked full of paintings and sculpture
5845659 figurative art is not very fashionable and i think its because people have got this notion that its about views of venice and portraits and nudes and that sort of stuff out of 2 700 entries we didnt have a single view of venice we want to show that there are works of figurative art which are edgy which are topical which are handling difficult issues
5845660 he essentially came from a blues funk and rock corner and it was his ability to bring this attack to a jazz context that always seemed to be the defining factor
5845661 it was this that endeared him to artists like gil for instance although he played on countless sessions he was a great live performer and this is where he stood out whether with sanborn bley or gil evans
5845662 basically they poison me to kill the cancer then bring me back to health actually i guess that last part is on me i needed to lose some weight anyway
5845663 today i went on a fast train through the tunnel under the sea
5845664 it only takes a couple of hours either way not bad eh
5845665 i know there are people out there going oh its all a big con
5845666 thats insulting to me because im proud to have somers town in my family of work if no one knew eurostar had funded it they wouldnt give it a second thought
5845667 basically we said to shane whatever you think it is it is
5845668 this was shanes project we had no idea what was coming out so there was a real danger of us ending up with something we couldnt use that was a massive risk for us
5845669 i do understand the suspicions but i wish people would not prejudge
5845670 its so difficult to get british films made that any form of new finance deserves to be explored the fact is that shane made this under the exact same auspices as hed make any film
5845671 if people are seeing the benefits to st pancras and the regeneration weve been involved in then that obviously helps our reputation if that makes them more likely to go on a eurostar train then thats good as well
5845672 those traditional coca cola ads id like to teach the world to sing they gave you a nice feeling inside but it was pretty intangible stuff this film has the same effect you come away thinking nice old eurostar and maybe that steers you towards buying a 150 train ticket
5845673 the moment its done badly it will be a disaster if people sit down to watch a damn good film then fair enough but if they pay to watch some grossly overt propaganda then theyll feel cheated and will end up resenting the brand and it will probably never happen again
5845674 well if you want to define it that way ive not got a clever argument to oppose it
5845675 but i never once thought about eurostar when i was making this film im not selling my soul to the devil here
5845676 tinkers with the holy bible of how films are made in this country
5845677 the first that proves i can move away from my community its also the first film where ive worked with actors in a foreign language its a film thats made me want to go to eastern europe its a film thats started me on a whole new path

5845680 be yourself because if you can get away with it that is the ultimate feminist act
5845681 the album made it ok for us girls to talk explicitly about sexuality in terms that only guys were allowed to use and it made it fine to acknowledge both the vulnerability as well as the fun and vulgar aspects of sexuality even if it was in the form of singing along
5845682 yes i wore a slinky red thing does that mean i should spread for you your friends your father mr ed
5845683 located emotional responses that werent being articulated by songs like jimmy mack
5845684 king grew up writing the boy centric songs in the brill building the new york office building famously used by music publishers and writers
5845685 with the exception of youre so vain which is about the peacockery of maledom her early records are very loving
5845686 but her songs were not especially saucer eyed theyre very realistic and mature
5845687 the same could be said of laura nyro and judee sill the language they use doesnt have the rage of alanis or liz phair or pj harvey but theres still some of that matching of rage to articulacy and thats unusual in pop
5845688 you could not play that on the radio now its incredibly filthy so its not as if it hadnt been expressed before liz phair
5845689 a lot of pop music is sold on its candour but its rarely as candid as guyville it opened up the expressive vocabulary for female artists
5845690 women dont have that long history of songwriting they cant refer to past examples which is why they go into themselves drawing on themselves
5845691 frequently almost tactical part of seduction its confession with a point
5845692 is not there to impress or to seduce its not a dance move
5845693 it wasnt written to elicit a response from this person or to seek any sort of revenge it was to unburden myself with my now allowing myself to just admit how i felt and in admitting how i felt by singing it so many times i kind of transcended it really i was able to admit all of this and to go forth from there instead of getting stuck
5845694 stand 6ft 1in instead of 5ft 2in and thats quite an achievement
5845695 i have talked to a number of people about running and have been very pleased by their response
5845696 theres a lot of things that can be done and need to be done in the city and its been nice to have good things said about you
5845697 if he should choose to run i think hed be a strong candidate
5845698 i had very good relations with him as governor and there was never an attempt to politicize the work we did
5845699 today i went on a fast train through the tunnel under the sea
5845700 it only takes a couple of hours either way not bad eh
5845701 i know there are people out there going oh its all a big con

5845714 it certainly flies in the face of the spirit of financial disclosure
5845715 in texas we have a long tradition of not talking about the number of cattle you own or your net worth
5845716 a blind trust businesswise is not very different from this grantor trust but youre taxed on passive income versus income
5845717 identification of each trust asset if known to the beneficiary from which income was received by the beneficiary in excess of 500
5845718 in my interpretation of the law you only have two choices you either disclose your assets if its in a regular trust or you have a blind trust

5845727 what makes this especially painful however is that chappel fork is one of the very rare places in pennsylvania where wild trout naturally reproduce
5845728 i try to do my art from as little as possible
5845729 opened with no fewer than four actually five maybe even six if you count
5845730 can you imagine if you were actually one of the dancers in that video how cool would that be

5845738 which being used to provide funds for projects by helping our country to be the richest country in the world
5845739 this is fairly reflective of the nations actual state and the governments short and long term plans and programs that focus on food and energy self sufficiency and self reliance
5845740 its not about what our country can do for us it is about what we can do for our country
5845741 let us help our president to overcome the perfect storm
5845742 i come here for transit information and talk but the majority of it seems to be pro rail propaganda
5845743 we are going through times when the value of all commodities including scrap metal is particularly high and its leading quite literally to highway robbery
5845744 sign and gully cover theft isnt just a cost issue but can lead to real danger to the public so i would appeal to people to be vigilant and to report anyone they spot working on the highway who they think shouldnt be there
5845745 people across the country not just in london can see for themselves that after just three months the new tory administration in london is in complete disarray
5845746 the mayor of london has been frank in his opposition to his leaders claim which has always been the most cynical nonsense
5845747 in doing so he has signalled that at least one senior conservative is fed up of david cameron running britain down
5845748 if youre going to take very important political decisions about london transport its absolutely vital the mayor chairs tfl and tim parker agrees with me that thats the way forward
5845749 his exit after just a couple of months in fact confirms the chaos which has existed in boris johnsons administration since day one
5845750 baggy jeans the defendant was wearing and the lace used to keep them up
5845751 its was very upsetting when the jury got dismissed it was dreadful im feeling a bit devastated
5845752 i had a pretty good suspicion that people who were well motivated would do well with the technique but you have to be committed to learning it for it to benefit you i suspected most folks might not be that committed and so we might not show terribly much
5845753 this is a good large trial it is good enough evidence for people to take it seriously
5845754 but at the moment the alexander technique is not available on the nhs
5845755 we urgently need to identify this unknown lodger who could have vital information to assist the murder investigation and to eliminate him from our enquiries
5845756 not what could be expected of anyone involved in organised crime
5845757 the level of violence used in the killings is completely disproportionate to the level of minor fraudulent activity discovered on the couples computer
5845758 following constructive discussions with the rmt today we have been able to agree in principle a two year deal that will satisfy all parties
5845759 whats particularly worrying is that huge amounts of the food and cotton we consume are grown in drier areas of the world where water resources are either already stressed or very likely to become so in the near future
5845760 we are already in discussion with wwf about our decisions about where to grow crops in the future
5845761 from our point of view weve got to look at where our growers are going to get their water from
5845762 there are massive challenges with water in places like murcia southern spain we have to look at least 10 years ahead in terms of security of supply murcia will have to look very different in five years time
5845763 well have to look at new desalination technologies and we may have to look at crops that can cope with more saline conditions such as broccoli we take tomatoes out of morocco in winter and weve looked very hard at moroccan water but its complex if you use more greenhouse production here it uses more energy peas and beans are a steady all year market weve got to think about how we get them here in a responsible manner
5845764 i want to see anyone who poses a threat to our children dealt with as firmly as possible
5845765 ive spoken to child protection experts and the police and they have told me that these changes will further restrict the ability of child sex offenders to harm children both here and overseas
5845766 we are concerned that current travel prevention orders designed to prevent offenders from going overseas are not working hardly any have been issued against sex offenders in the past five years
5845767 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
5845768 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world i want gary glitter to be controlled while hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5845769 brian i dont know what ill do if tarique becomes my deputy
5845770 i dont think it is something ian blair has ever forgotten
5845771 it was a devastating blow to the case ian blair was utterly furious with tarique he had no notice tarique would do that and it was clearly damaging it was at a critical time when blair was launching his bid for commissioner
5845772 he delivered excellent results he did in the end win people round
5845773 it would be seen as directly attacking the authority of the commissioner and cabinet collective responsibility
5845774 he came very close to not having his contract renewed
5845775 by the time he arrived at the unit he was already in the last chance saloon
5845776 tarique has added value to the force but hes reached his limit and does not realise that i realise that ive reached my limit hes brilliant at some things but just doesnt realise his weaknesses
5845777 the effect will be disastrous it represents a real setback for their race equality efforts internally
5845778 died supporting his own men he has helped to save the lives of many afghan soldiers and civilians alike
5845779 barry was a devoted husband and father he has died doing a job he loved his family and the army was his life he will be forever missed by his wife children and family he will never be forgotten he died a hero
5845780 during that time an improvised explosive device was detonated which resulted in the death of cpl dempsey and shrapnel and blast injuries to one other isaf international security assistance force an afghan national army soldier and the patrol interpreter
5845781 we are currently thinking of ways of marking des and carols final show
5845782 it was dreadful really dreadful one minute they were all laughing and squirting each other with water pistols it was a long straight stretch of road and the tractor had broken down at the side
5845783 we didnt see it happen but we were told that the driver a young lad was squirted with water which temporarily blinded him
5845784 four jeeps went out on the safari three of them had passed the broken down tractor but as the fourth jeep came down the road a german motorbike tourist thought hed join in the fun and threw water at the jeep
5845785 it hit the driver in the face and temporarily blinded him he swerved to avoid the tractor but the back of our vehicle hit the tractors trailer and the passengers were thrown out
5845786 it is all too soon and still raw at the moment to say anything else
5845787 we can confirm that two british nationals died and seven were injured in a road traffic accident whilst on a jeep safari in turkey yesterday
5845788 my name is john mccain lt commander john mccain u s navy
5845789 we hereby officially proclaim so and so as our nominee for president and so and so our nominee for vice president
5845790 take great pride in providing a platform for people and businesses to share articles and magazines in an interactive and fun format
5845791 one of them and i will not say which one said to me not long ago you know what in other democracies people take turns why cant we
5845792 everybody who disliked president musharraf ended up disliking the united states
5845793 as with previous multi year drm development efforts this one disintegrated like wet kleenex on contact with the general public now that vista hdcp blu ray and hd dvd are all broken it seems like the millions of dollars and thousands of work hours sunk into these systems was mis spent the only benefit that these anti copying systems confer to the companies that developed them is the right to sue competitors and that benefit could have been had by shellacking a one atom thick layer of token drm onto their systems just enough to be able to invoke the dmca everything else was just gold plating wasted money
5845794 whats particularly worrying is that huge amounts of the food and cotton we consume are grown in drier areas of the world where water resources are either already stressed or very likely to become so in the near future
5845795 we are already in discussion with wwf about our decisions about where to grow crops in the future
5845796 from our point of view weve got to look at where our growers are going to get their water from
5845797 there are massive challenges with water in places like murcia southern spain we have to look at least 10 years ahead in terms of security of supply murcia will have to look very different in five years time
5845798 well have to look at new desalination technologies and we may have to look at crops that can cope with more saline conditions such as broccoli we take tomatoes out of morocco in winter and weve looked very hard at moroccan water but its complex if you use more greenhouse production here it uses more energy peas and beans are a steady all year market weve got to think about how we get them here in a responsible manner
5845799 money its a hit dont give me that do goody good bullshit
5845800 the money age were living through now is a short term futureless kind of prosperity
5845801 money is a more democratic medium than blood but money as a cultural banner you can feel the whole society deteriorating around you because of that
5845802 a c d hybrid and soft in the head to boot
5845803 colorado and the west are both a big focus of this campaign
5845804 that investment and the energy that we see on the ground in new mexico will absolutely translate in november
5845805 in a place like montana there simply werent the resources to keep a party headquarters opened during the entire year in non election years and so it was very difficult
5845806 it kept people on the ground recruiting new candidates maintaining voter files making sure we have county committees that are working and organised
5845807 the government not telling you how to live your life and what to do
5845808 in the 1970s people would have felt it was social death to go to an open day with their parent now its the norm
5845809 universities are increasingly and self consciously addressing parents as much as children in how they market themselves now they see it as a three way conversation with parents acting as advocates in the way that schools rather than universities are used to
5845810 the conventional explanation is that with parents paying more for their childs education they want a bigger say in it but i think it goes deeper than that
5845811 there is a powerful sense of infantilism where parents cant let go
5845812 i welcome the universities acknowledgement that its us as parents who pay the fees and we have a right to know whats going on and be involved
5845813 but weve got to be really really careful we dont take away the ability of youngsters to find their own responsibility university is about learning how to be independent and that should be protected
5845814 about one in 10 students have used the option our customer service tells us anecdotally that for the most part its when son or daughter has called their parent calls back to ask further questions
5845815 there are some of what you might call pushy parents using it with half a million applicants a year some are very very strong minded and independent and others want their parents to do the work for them
5845816 the coalition has to address the issues and get on with it
5845817 with the disagreements first on the president and then on the judges they are making fools of themselves
5845818 some of our partners had reservations over timing im very hopeful the country cannot afford break up of the coalition
5845819 what we are seeing is no change in the pakistan government policies after musharraf
5845820 we had an ok winter and a good spring but we are having a tough summer
5845821 recently isaf and ana forces were deployed into the area and started going on patrol this was their third patrol and it came under attack yesterday afternoon and it lasted several hours there were coalition air bombardments but it is an uninhabited area so we have no reports of civilian casualties
5845822 the taliban wanted to show off to the world with a spectacular strike
5845823 this morning we ambushed nato troops in sorobi district using mines and rockets we destroyed five vehicles
5845824 france is resolved to fight terror for democracy and for freedom
5845825 the cause is just and it is the honour of france and of her military to defend it
5845826 what are the aims of this war how many troops must there be to reach its stated objectives
5845827 there are families suffering who must be cursing sarko for having sent young guys out there to act the big guy in front of his friend bush
5845828 without sarkozys political choice these men would still be with us
5845829 very firmly condemns the terrorist acts that have just claimed so many lives
5845830 of the support of france in the fight against terrorism
5845831 i dont really care what people think or what people say
5845832 as far as i am concerned i am here and i won a gold medal they can say what they like but i really dont care
5845833 why should this be spoiled unless someone tries to im very happy with myself im very happy that i have picked up three gold medals in three major championships
5845834 i needed to sort my head out i felt tired i hadnt slept for the past two nights and the pressure was getting to me but i just thought keep going you can win
5845835 i am very busy and busy means i get a bit scatterbrained and that is just how i am i am not going to beat myself over it the mistake was made and you just move on
5845836 i didnt realise what people were saying until my brother called me and naturally it upset me
5845837 i have given thought to london but it is a long way away
5845838 it is literally on my doorstep and 15 minutes away from where my parents live and it is where i was brought up and lived all my life so it would be great if i could say i would be there but it is a long way away
5845839 its hannah montana meets the shield with a touch of battlestar galactica
5845840 we know that redistribution alone as the sole policy tool to tackle poverty has failed
5845841 there are 900 000 more people in severe poverty than in 1997 and child poverty has been rising for two years in succession
5845842 that approach is failing because it relies on a flawed assumption that only the state can guarantee fairness
5845843 experts are telling us that the profile of fans that follow pete doherty and babyshambles is volatile and they can easily be whipped up into a frenzy whereas the profile of someone that would follow around cliff richard or bucks fizz for example is completely different
5845844 we carried out an analysis of what pete doherty and his band does what he does as part of his routine is to gee up the crowd
5845845 they speed up and then slow down the music and create a whirlpool effect in the crowd they the crowd all get geed up and then they start fighting
5845846 hes very kindly offered a free gig for everyone who has bought a ticket and wont be able to see him
5845847 they told me privately they hate the fact he lives in wiltshire and they dont want him on their patch
5845848 it is unfortunate that this coincided with the absence of the governor for some months and the resulting drift that was observable at this inspection needs urgently to be reversed
5845849 the issues raised in the report are currently being addressed by the governor and staff at frankland a new diversity and safer prisons manager is in post to ensure a focus on matters raised by the inspector in relation to anti bullying and diversity
5845850 gmac has placed a high priority on promoting the importance of financial literacy
5845851 our commitment is to increase public awareness and understanding of personal finance and to make strides in strengthening our communities
5845852 this partnership with gmac helps us provide residents in harlem and the surrounding area with guidance on financial issues that are important to them
5845853 whether buying a home planning a budget or starting a business its important for every member of the community to be knowledgeable about how to make the most of their finances
5845854 there can be no business as usual under present circumstances
5845855 the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honour the words of president dmitry medvedev to abide by the six point peace plan which is not happening at the moment
5845856 considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5845857 full respect for the principles of georgias independence sovereignty and territorial integrity
5845858 if the west swallows the pill and forgives russia the georgian war the invasion of peacekeeping tanks into ukraine will just be a matter of time
5845859 how do you prevent the russian ships from coming in
5845860 i dont know of any way to do so if we continue to stick to the point of view of not letting them in this will mean a war between ukraine and russia
5845861 the material seized from you is amongst the largest and most extensive ever discovered and thus makes this case one of the most serious of its type to come before the courts
5845862 it is that material which was possessed by you for a specific intention to be used in due course to provide practical assistance in terrorist activity
5845863 folder demonstrating in careful methodical and lethal detail the step by step instructions of how to make a suicide bombers vest or belt packed with ball bearings and explosives
5845864 it was the highest grossing film in singapore in 2007 but is not likely to go on general release in the uk as its a subtitled musical
5845865 nevertheless we believe this film will attract audiences with its coverage of the unique singaporean getai art form
5845866 asian directors such as mira nair are acclaimed way beyond their home countries and we regularly see asian actors appearing in hollywood box office successes and becoming household names
5845867 hollywood has been remaking asian films for years such as infernal affairs remade as the departed by martin scorsese the ring and dark water
5845868 it is very unusual for the royal albert hall to have to request police assistance and on that occasion they had to
5845869 we have carried out an analysis of what doherty does his band speed up and then slow down the music and create a whirlpool effect in the crowd then the crowd starts fighting we became concerned because the organiser did not appear to have due cognisance of all the risks
5845870 you are talking of as many as 5 000 people in what is effectively an open field
5845871 it wouldnt surprise me if they wanted him but they would have plenty of hoops to jump through
5845872 weve got a producers assistant doing it though shes not too pleased we keep running into her shoving clothes into the office laundry
5845873 we dont want to say you should pay more for him because he is an a list person and that one is a b list person you wont pay more to see sean connery than to see an unknown local author from tollcross
5845874 we chose ice hockey players because there is a lot of aggressive behaviour in the games and its usually an acceptable way of performing successfully we could also measure this aggression in terms of the number of penalty minutes
5845875 together these findings suggest that the sexually dimorphic facial width to height ratio may be an honest signal of propensity for aggressive behaviour
5845876 together these findings suggest that people can make accurate inferences about others personality traits and behavioural dispositions based on certain signals conveyed by the face
5845877 we propose that the physical features that become evident around puberty are a result of differences in testosterone and that testosterone may be responsible for determining the width to height ratio
5845878 we at unesco believe that culture not only makes an economic contribution it provides meaning and a sense of identity and continuity that is integral to the life of all societies
5845879 gt last nights tv the genius of charles darwin channel 4
5845880 we are a big team but we have gelled very well and its been a lot of fun
5845881 we will never be able to remove boots on the ground totally but technology like that on show here will mean that fewer soldiers will be in harms way
5845882 urban environments are where wars will be fought in the future and we need to make sure that we stay ahead of our enemies weve come a long way from the use of binoculars thats for sure
5845883 i have no qualms at all about saying that were pretty elitist i know thats a word that doesnt maybe sit comfortably with a lot of british culture but thats what we are we want to win absolutely everything
5845884 a lot of the other nations talk about the money we have but its not a slot machine
5845885 you dont just put lottery money in the top pull the lever and a load of gold medals come out at the bottom
5845886 if it was everybody would be doing it prior to lottery funding we had won one olympic medal in 76 years in track cycling weve been trying to do this for a long long time and this isnt just an overnight success weve been working very hard at it
5845887 thats whats scared the rest of the world they knew chris hoy bradley wiggins vicky pendleton and our pursuit team were good but when they see a 20 year old like jason kenny winning silver in the individual sprint that really scared everybody
5845888 the ones who think they know it all will be the ones who probably arent performing to the best of their ability we dont know it all but we always want to learn from others its that quest for knowledge that goes with success
5845889 i went over there to win the tour de france
5845890 i grew up in north wales and i was pretty naive i knew after the second year that i wouldnt make it but i still tried
5845891 i just manage i conduct an orchestra of people who have more expertise than i have im interested in excellence in human beings
5845892 encourage consumers to dispose of clothes which have only been worn a few times in favour of new cheap garments which themselves will also go out of fashion and be discarded within a matter of months
5845893 it was famously vital in enabling britain to survive in 1940 41 and then for the allies to triumph in 1945 but more than that as the birthplace of the computer it was one of the three crucibles with peenem nde in germany and los alamos in the us in which the modern world was forged it stands for the triumph of intelligence over barbarism we would let down not only the generation who worked in bletchley but our childrens generation if we failed to preserve it for posterity
5845894 good minds at bletchley helped save their generation from evil now this generation must help save it
5845895 the worst suggestion i heard was that we should preserve the country house and tear down all the wooden huts because they are rotten and unsightly
5845896 they may be unsightly but that is where history was made if they just took a little of the millions they are spending on the 2012 olympics they could save this site
5845897 asda 76 15 tesco 49 50 why pay more at asda
5845898 morrisons 75 11 tesco 49 58 save a trolley load of cash at tesco
5845899 if you believe the politicians we have a broken society in which the courage and morals of young people have been sapped by the welfarism and political correctness if you look at what is happening at the beijing olympics you can see what piffle it is
5845900 it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be taken are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge
5845901 that it would not be appropriate for an unelected official to chair a body which is responsible for most of the money and a large part of the brief of an elected mayor
5845902 i also agree with the mayor that my position as adviser does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority gla or the title of first deputy mayor i look forward to advising boris on an ongoing basis on transport
5845903 as far as tim is concerned his appointment was boriss biggest coup by far he is a very successful businessman who was going to be chief executive of london somehow all of that has gone for a piece of chalk
5845904 relationships on the eighth floor are riddled with tensions and while boris was keen to give him this position of first deputy mayor mr parkers colleagues were clearly not supportive
5845905 the wheels are coming off this new administration why is boris losing yet another adviser has tim parker discovered that running london isnt as easy as running private business
5845906 people across the country not just in london can see for themselves that after just three months the new tory administration in london is in complete disarray
5845907 the mayor of london has been frank in his opposition to his leaders claim which has always been the most cynical nonsense
5845908 in doing so he has signalled that at least one senior conservative is fed up of david cameron running britain down
5845909 if youre going to take very important political decisions about london transport its absolutely vital the mayor chairs tfl and tim parker agrees with me that thats the way forward
5845910 his exit after just a couple of months in fact confirms the chaos which has existed in boris johnsons administration since day one

5845917 is whether public opinion will be reinforced in its feeling of the uselessness of the french presence in afghanistan or whether the public will rally round their soldiers in difficulty and become more favourable to it
5845918 the juror who found this report went looking for it in defiance of what i said
5845919 it is very unfortunate for all those concerned and for the tax payer the chief consideration is that this defendant receives a fair trial
5845920 i spoke to him just now and he said everything is ok he is happy to be going home he was in a good mood
5845921 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5845922 ive spoken to child protection experts and the police and they have told me that these changes will further restrict the ability of child sex offenders to harm children both here and overseas i will legislate for these measures as soon as possible
5845923 these moves will help protect vulnerable children around the world from coming to harm at the hands of abusers it is essential that we work as an international community to reach a point where there are no safe havens for those abusers and thus ensuring that a child no matter where they are growing up can be as safe as possible
5845924 you kept quiet for 30 years i couldnt have kept quiet for 30 minutes
5845925 actually i was lucky because i married a mathematician from hut 6 so although we never talked to the family or anyone else we have talked about it to each other
5845926 other people had to force it so far down that they have forgotten it all and its very difficult to collect oral history it was the way to do it nobody talked to anybody outside their own unit because if the germans had ever found out that we had broken their codes that would have been the crown jewels gone
5845927 one should never forget the poles who first uncovered enigma and dilly knox arrived absolutely on day one he was the pioneer he was an absolutely wonderful character and very easy to work with but he was odd just like someone out of alice in wonderland
5845928 i must absolutely emphasise that i take absolutely no credit for this i was the one who happened to get the message to decode
5845929 most of the time we never knew what it was that we broke because once we had worked out the crib we passed it to a machinist to decode the whole message
5845930 who was the guy we talked to about that thing
5845931 as we all know collecting knowledge if it happens at all usually involves a person or organization monitoring knowledge as it is created and then capturing and categorizing it after the fact this could either be the knowledge worker as they create it or someone else charged with this mission this process is both inefficient and inherently flawed typically the expert or the users themselves know what the best knowledge is not some third party who is one step removed from the actual work however the experts and users lack the tools time and incentive to carry out this critical task
5845932 when i was working in ecm i used to joke about the
5845933 fellow countrymen with deep sorrow and grief i would like to inform the people of zambia that our president dr levy patrick mwanawasa died this morning at 10 30 hours
5845934 i also wish to inform the nation that national mourning starts today and will be for seven days
5845935 when it comes to supplier diversity arvinmeritor has set aggressive targets for on going investments with minority suppliers while were making good progress we still have room for improvement
5845936 to reach our goals we have made a commitment toward creating a pipeline of opportunity for our minority supply base
5845937 i want to see anyone who poses a threat to our children dealt with as firmly as possible
5845938 ive spoken to child protection experts and the police and they have told me that these changes will further restrict the ability of child sex offenders to harm children both here and overseas
5845939 we are concerned that current travel prevention orders designed to prevent offenders from going overseas are not working hardly any have been issued against sex offenders in the past five years
5845940 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
5845941 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world i want gary glitter to be controlled while hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5845942 following a rigorous review of operating performance and local market dynamics these company owned outlets are not producing acceptable returns
5845943 taking this action now will allow us to focus our attention on locations with the best long term potential
5845944 it will help position goodyear to be a stronger competitor
5845945 will whoville still be a major city sure it will still have its various corporate headquarters
5845946 you and i both drink from the same well of inspiration the difference is that you get to piss in it
5845947 even the weight watchers web tool is amazingly gamelike it has the poke around and see what happens elegance you see in really good rpg game screens accidentally snack on a candy bar and ruin your meal plan for the day no worries just go into the database and see what spells whoops i mean foods you can still use with your remaining points and those 35 extra points you get every week theyre like a special buff or potion a last ditch save when youre on the ropes indeed im in awe of the sheer brilliance of weight watchers in adopting the word points as its metric for measuring food the word immediately shoves the user into the semantics and fun of gameplay you regard losing weight as an intriguing challenge as opposed to a mere grind
5845948 this puts me in mind of the talk that jane mcconigal a brilliant and pioneering alternative reality game designer gave at this years south by southwest conference she argued that game designers ought to put their skills to use in the real world by reshaping dull everydayday activities into fun challenges

5845951 i wouldnt exclude having said that but if theyre going to provide us with such a splendid contraption they can at least help us out with it
5845952 not of the standard were used to the people at the consulate appear to be used to getting drunk tourists out of prison but are unaware of the sort of service they should give to german mps
5845953 i was getting breakfast and thought ah i just dont want to talk to her today so i bumped it
5845954 then two seconds later there was a message from nicole wishing us good luck
5845955 i ended up returning her call she was very happy
5845956 she was very surprised that we do have a tradition of naming our boats after her movies and shes just really stoked to be part of a team
5845957 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5845958 from this survey its very hard to see almost any discernible trends in volunteering in any part of the population at all
5845959 this is deeply depressing considering that tens of millions of pounds worth of taxpayers money has been ploughed into increasing volunteering
5845960 volunteering has been the governments main third sector focus since 2000 and its not rocket science to conclude that by now we ought to be seeing trends going upwards rather than staying flat
5845961 we have millions of public money poured into v which although i think has the right approach still hasnt translated into more young volunteers in fact the numbers are falling you have to ask why
5845962 were not satisfied that the sample size is conclusive a survey of 700 young people is not statistically significant wed like to work with government on improving research in this area
5845963 we have a perfectly legal right to go back and rescind our own policy without a public hearing public input without any kind of a public meeting process
5845964 it has little to do if you are pro or con on clothing optional beaches
5845965 its our contention that the directors action was done illegally
5845966 to say that this letter means nothing when the people of the state of california relied on it for 20 years it flies in the face of any logic
5845967 no person shall appear nude while in any unit except in authorized areas set aside for that purpose by the department
5845968 two caucasian males one wouldnt guess theyd respond differently to drugs but we found that for one drug metabolising gene watsons dna indicated he was likely to respond to drugs differently
5845969 i never place anyone with downs syndrome because they all have a tendency to cuddle people
5845970 its difficult to explain just how important these places are
5845971 its not just getting young people off the streets its giving them a space where they dont feel threatened
5845972 people are scared of kids hanging about on the streets but if there is no club where do they expect them to go
5845973 were hoping this blueprint will provide the framework for allowing youth clubs to achieve their full potential in communities around the country and a crucial issue is helping build a workforce of youth workers to facilitate this
5845974 government is focused on this idea of extended schools and requiring councils to provide young people with positive activities but youth clubs more in demand from than ever before are unfashionable and misrepresented within political circles this is what were planning to change
5845975 we want to stop these thefts before they have an effect on infection control visitors cant wash their hands on entering some wards
5845976 it can cause convulsions coma and serious damage to organs but of course people who resort to this are already seriously unwell as a result of alcohol
5845977 i want to see anyone who poses a threat to our children dealt with as firmly as possible
5845978 ive spoken to child protection experts and the police and they have told me that these changes will further restrict the ability of child sex offenders to harm children both here and overseas
5845979 we are concerned that current travel prevention orders designed to prevent offenders from going overseas are not working hardly any have been issued against sex offenders in the past five years
5845980 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
5845981 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world i want gary glitter to be controlled while hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5845982 it is unfortunate that this coincided with the absence of the governor for some months and the resulting drift that was observable at this inspection needs urgently to be reversed
5845983 the issues raised in the report are currently being addressed by the governor and staff at frankland a new diversity and safer prisons manager is in post to ensure a focus on matters raised by the inspector in relation to anti bullying and diversity
5845984 journalists have been endlessly asking me how does a white girl from the countryside end up doing something like this
5845985 i dont know how i got here street dance was something i became really passionate about and one step follows another and you arrive at something
5845986 saying i cant do this is like saying a black man from hackney cant direct an opera anyone can do anything arent we past putting people in boxes
5845987 i saw janet jackson one day on mtv and that was the moment when i said i want to do that
5845988 i know it sounds crap but to me it was cool everyone doing intricate fast choreography
5845989 everyone in zoonation is there because they have worked hard they have made good decisions they have decided not to go down an avenue but to be part of a team and try to do something with their lives
5845990 we love dancing performing and making each other laugh and we like working with young people
5845991 we saw that it was about the bigger picture we had the opportunity to get people into the theatre who previously would have had nothing but a negative image of hip hop and young people and to get them leaving with a smile on their face
5845992 the power we have now is to go out and reach those who may not make the good decisions may not have that opportunity
5845993 i remember getting into trouble and running away when i was young just to get that adrenalin rush and bonding thing if youre doing dance youre not going out and robbing someone youre too motivated and knackered
5845994 im not saying dance is going to save the world
5845995 but it will make a dent in the problem and there are problems
5845996 ive run out of hands and we dont have funding but dance and music is such a beautiful gift it can change how people feel about themselves
5845997 i dont want to be quoted as an idiot who thinks if we all start dancing everything will be ok
5845998 but it will help unless someones got a brighter idea
5845999 landlords welcome students with open arms but families require long term secure tenancies
5846000 one reason incarceration rates are lower in europe is that the issue is not a political football
5846001 the american dream would result in a nightmare in england and wales
5846002 when pentonville was built it was always big it holds over 1 200 people
5846003 what do people find objectionable about size they say it is hard to manage a large scale institution the implied criticism is that standards will drop and we are incapable of running larger things
5846004 but the same argument would apply to running bigger shops such as supermarkets compared to corner shops faced with the challenges of inefficiences we have to find a better way by breaking these things into units you can provide an effective and humane regime for people
5846005 london is short of 11 000 places so there are 11 000 people from london postcodes who are stuck in buses and driven up the m1 and a1 and down the m3
5846006 i went there as would an offenders mother without a car let me tell you that is the toughest getting to visit your child or husband stuck in the middle of nowhere takes hours and hours if we value this continuity of family links then we have got to get over this prejudice about size and say we have to find a way to do this
5846007 the question i would ask her is why she and everybody else has been so ineffectual in persuading the judiciary of their point of view
5846008 one reason incarceration rates are lower in europe is that the issue is not a political football
5846009 the interesting question for the next couple of years is whether this locking up people will be depoliticised or not
5846010 it is a question of what the parties will agree it is highly unlikely the government will mandate a grid if the judiciary do not wish to implement it but you have got to have something
5846011 then we have to face up to the fact that we have to build more prisons and that is it
5846012 i had a pretty good suspicion that people who were well motivated would do well with the technique but you have to be committed to learning it for it to benefit you i suspected most folks might not be that committed and so we might not show terribly much
5846013 this is a good large trial it is good enough evidence for people to take it seriously
5846014 but at the moment the alexander technique is not available on the nhs
5846015 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5846016 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5846017 a layoff is done because of union rules i dont know where you get that
5846018 thats just a phony headline its done by union rules im sorry about 99 percent of the people are unionized in the city of chicago so dont make up phony stories
5846019 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5846020 united behind a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care with everyone in and no one left out
5846021 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5846022 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5846023 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5846024 it can take up to 10 years for a person to develop type 2 diabetes so it means we have yet to see the most damaging effects of childhood obesity
5846025 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5846026 in the 1970s people would have felt it was social death to go to an open day with their parent now its the norm
5846027 universities are increasingly and self consciously addressing parents as much as children in how they market themselves now they see it as a three way conversation with parents acting as advocates in the way that schools rather than universities are used to
5846028 the conventional explanation is that with parents paying more for their childs education they want a bigger say in it but i think it goes deeper than that
5846029 there is a powerful sense of infantilism where parents cant let go
5846030 i welcome the universities acknowledgement that its us as parents who pay the fees and we have a right to know whats going on and be involved
5846031 but weve got to be really really careful we dont take away the ability of youngsters to find their own responsibility university is about learning how to be independent and that should be protected
5846032 about one in 10 students have used the option our customer service tells us anecdotally that for the most part its when son or daughter has called their parent calls back to ask further questions
5846033 there are some of what you might call pushy parents using it with half a million applicants a year some are very very strong minded and independent and others want their parents to do the work for them
5846034 london challenge has been very successful it tells us that additional resources and improvement strategies need to be precisely targeted if schools are to receive the right kind of support to raise achievement and in particular to narrow the achievement gap between rich and poor
5846035 it is unacceptable that children have the odds stacked against them simply by default of having poorer parents the government must put its money where its mouth is and end child poverty so that all children no matter their background have equal chances to achieve a decent education
5846036 at gcse the gap in achievement between children from poorer and more affluent backgrounds is narrowing and results for children on free school meals are rising faster than the average since 2002 the percentage of pupils on free school meals achieving five or more a c grades at gcse has risen by 12 5 percentage points in comparison with 9 1 percentage points for pupils not on free school meals
5846037 weve received very reliable information that this particular defendant was the mastermind and the person who brought together this conspiracy
5846038 they tricked the victim into leaving and going to a desolate area at which point they used a deadly weapon robbed him of his personal property including his wallet and cell phone and at which point they summarily executed the victim and left his body on the roadway
5846039 the coalition has to address the issues and get on with it
5846040 with the disagreements first on the president and then on the judges they are making fools of themselves
5846041 some of our partners had reservations over timing im very hopeful the country cannot afford break up of the coalition
5846042 what we are seeing is no change in the pakistan government policies after musharraf
5846043 we had an ok winter and a good spring but we are having a tough summer
5846044 recently isaf and ana forces were deployed into the area and started going on patrol this was their third patrol and it came under attack yesterday afternoon and it lasted several hours there were coalition air bombardments but it is an uninhabited area so we have no reports of civilian casualties
5846045 the taliban wanted to show off to the world with a spectacular strike
5846046 this morning we ambushed nato troops in sorobi district using mines and rockets we destroyed five vehicles
5846047 france is resolved to fight terror for democracy and for freedom
5846048 the cause is just and it is the honour of france and of her military to defend it
5846049 what are the aims of this war how many troops must there be to reach its stated objectives
5846050 there are families suffering who must be cursing sarko for having sent young guys out there to act the big guy in front of his friend bush
5846051 without sarkozys political choice these men would still be with us
5846052 the proportion of childless women has been increasing steadily by about one percentage point a year
5846053 women are waiting longer to finish their education so childbearing starts later
5846054 you will need to be able to copy the look and style of both authors signatures
5846055 we like how light and airy it is and the flow of the house
5846056 and all of the changes they made such as the placement of the windows are things we would have done ourselves
5846057 my winter home actually has less volume at least the part i live in i did add a couple of big rooms for entertaining
5846058 what is happening in real estate proves people have been holding back on buying and selling
5846059 we approached the practical and the beautiful ad well as the architectural
5846060 what is the name of that famous bookstore in denver yes ive been to the tattered cover many times

5846068 this was emilys first extended fishing trip up north since she moved to minnesota in 1993
5846069 she hadnt fished since she was a child in kenya and this was her first experience fishing minnesota style

5846076 but what hope has a band of desperate men against four children
5846077 money its a hit dont give me that do goody good bullshit
5846078 the money age were living through now is a short term futureless kind of prosperity
5846079 money is a more democratic medium than blood but money as a cultural banner you can feel the whole society deteriorating around you because of that
5846080 a c d hybrid and soft in the head to boot
5846081 i think we took everything a little too seriously back then
5846082 obviously its changed a lot since then writing a pop song wasnt very high on our agenda but now we definitely want to write songs with a pop edge
5846083 its not long ago that i thought things might not happen for us
5846084 this was emilys first extended fishing trip up north since she moved to minnesota in 1993
5846085 she hadnt fished since she was a child in kenya and this was her first experience fishing minnesota style

5846093 hey susie come on out here the angels are bowling
5846094 yep theres another strike theyre having a good time tonight
5846095 every now and then the angels like to go bowling that bolt of lightning is when one of them throws the ball and it hits the alley in a few second the ball hits the pins and that noise you hear is when the angel gets a strike and all the pins fall over
5846096 those chickens dont belong to anybody you know you could make them yours

5846105 i even got contacted by a former singer from nigeria who lives in sweden now
5846106 and was pleasantly surprised to have found some of his old music online
5846107 wants to bring to light some little known nigerian sounds particularly igbo music which is almost unheard outside of nigeria
5846108 world music purists look down their noses at a lot of this stuff because it can be cheesy and derivative
5846109 but this is the sort of music that the masses in africa listen to
5846110 more and more of my friends and associates who do not fall into the stereotypical world music demography i e old white and male had started paying more attention to music from outside america and europe
5846111 there seemed to be an opportunity to encourage younger people like my friends who werent around for the initial world beat boom in the 80s
5846112 victorian tafe teachers have been left with no choice but to stopwork today following tafe employers and the victorian governments refusal to resolve the dispute over a new certified agreement
5846113 social networking sites such as facebook are a fast growing phenomenon
5846114 social network users need to realise that the information and photos they put into cyberspace in some cases can be seen by others and can leave a digital tattoo that can be difficult to erase
5846115 the latest research from the us suggests 44 per cent of employers are now using sites like myspace and facebook to research job candidates
5846116 as a general rule its best not to publish information you would not want the world to know

5846120 my section is scheduled at 2 45 in the afternoon do i really have to not eat past midnight or can i eat at like 4am or something because i cant imagine going 16 18 hours without food not being able to eat until a few hours after recovery especially with the gestational diabetes and being hungry every few hours
5846121 ill write a note for them to see if they can move you up on the schedule most times theres a patient or two who go into labor before their scheduled date so they can probably move you up
5846122 how bout change the day to the day before when my regular ob can do the surgery

5846131 when the number of rows selected by the query is around 1 4 of the number of data pages in the table the index was not useful and it is more efficient to perform a table scan to fetch the rows selected this often turns out to be less than 5 of the rows in the table

5846133 i slacked off in my office and then was insubordinate to my boss with hilarious consequences

5846146 well if he were black he would be dropped out of high school to play professional b ball but since hes white and wants to drop out then hell just end up robbing a bank and working for a gas station if he were a mexican that dropped out then he would be working on cars like low riders or selling oranges or something like that maybe even roses if he were asian and dropped out then his family would have disowned him right about now

5846158 the recall itself is touted as a powerful tool of regulators for keeping consumers safe and the consumer product safety commission points to the growing number of recalls as an indication that the system is working to protect consumers but sometimes not enough is done beyond the announcement to ensure that consumers and all retailers know about the recall the cpsc is charged with ensuring that roughly 15 000 products in the u s marketplace today are safe to use yet when a product is cited as a hazard it is mainly up to the consumer to learn about the recall and take action unlike ms bykowski few consumers do on average just 15 to 30 of consumers who have purchased a defective product respond when the item is recalled says the cpsc responses can rise to about 60 for higher profile recalls that include some childrens products or home appliances but often more than two thirds of recalled products go unaccounted for leaving children and adults vulnerable to injuries ranging from lead poisoning caused by mouthing certain toys to burns from overheated fax machines that is because the notification which relies in part on press releases that may or may not be picked up by the media is often lax or low tech and many consumers simply dont want to deal with the paperwork or the hassle of mailing something back especially large items like a crib which has to be disassembled of course many consumers may never learn of the recall

5846189 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5846190 targeting u s and other nato forces and afghan forces have become larger and bolder and they include direct almost conventional style attacks
5846191 in late 2006 and into 2007 there was a much greater reluctance among the taliban and other groups to carry out these conventional style attacks
5846192 they clearly believe they are winning now and its caused them to be a bit more audacious
5846193 heartfelt thanks for the sacrifice that they are making and the commitment that the french are making to help secure afghanistan
5846194 its important to remember that we are all engaged in a serious effort to bring about a stable afghanistan
5846195 france will continue to assume its responsibilities in favor of a democratic and peaceful afghanistan and in the fight against terrorism
5846196 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5846197 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying large parts of georgia i cannot see the nato russia council meeting
5846198 the future will depend on concrete actions from the russian side
5846199 no specific decisions on programs or projects with russia have been taken
5846200 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want this process to move faster
5846201 the alliance has to take united firm position but without being aggressive
5846202 trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5846203 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5846204 it needs to happen faster thats what theyve agreed to
5846205 the united states sought precisely what we got in this statement
5846206 this alliance is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5846207 there will absolutely be no new line and nato does not accept that there is a new line
5846208 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5846209 we are very disappointed because despite the promise to us there is no withdrawal of troops
5846210 when you sign up to an agreement you have to respect it
5846211 we dont want to use this sort of pressure but we also dont want this document to remain a dead letter
5846212 it was an opportune moment in this sense that russian prime minister vladimir putin and george bush were together at the olympics dmitri medvedev the what i call proxy president of russia was cruising down the volga river and it looked like a quick move could be made the georgians could not have of course estimated that they would get away with this without some russian response maybe a fait accompli taking the city setting up a government there would have in fact made the russians hesitate
5846213 my best guess about saakashvilis thinking is somehow he believed i think futilely and mistakenly that the west particularly his friend george bush would come to his aid in some way but how they would come to his aid they couldnt do it militarily is a very difficult question
5846214 what he did expect i believe was a far less aggressive russian response coupled with a far more aggressive political diplomatic intervention on the part of the european union nato and the united states so i think he thought that under those circumstances a lesser russian response a more active political diplomatic response from the west and a quick move on their georgian part against what looked like a vulnerable target tskhinvali it would have amounted to a significant strategic advantage that he could move act upon but all of that adds up in all its parts to a miscalculation
5846215 the russian action was a big mistake because they went beyond south ossetia and theyve launched a second front in abkhazia which of course opened them to severe criticism and a severe reaction from western countries because this was an aberration of international law going into the sovereign territory of another country it wasnt just the conflict zone that is it was going beyond that so what russia did by this action was really open up this whole conflict to the international gaze im not sure ultimately thats what russia wanted because now the pressure is on russia to accept a diplomatic solution

5846229 ebitda from usa operations decreased by a 118 million to a 11 million
5846230 the result was driven by the continued significant deterioration in housing activity with us housing starts down 27 to 1 13 million compared to 1 55 million starts in the prior year
5846231 lower volumes increased raw material costs and one off costs of us 4 million associated with programs to reconfigure borals brick and roof tile production network contributed to the severe fall in earnings particularly in the second half of the year
5846232 cost reduction initiatives including network optimisation and overhead reduction aimed at reducing fixed costs continue to be implemented across the brick and roof tile business with an expected incremental benefit of us 31 5m in fy2009
5846233 overall borals earnings before interest tax depreciation amp amortisation ebitda declined by 10 to 688 million australian ebitda of 657 million was 52 million or 9 higher than the prior year offshore ebitda however declined by a 123 million or 82 to a 27 million
5846234 in australia ebitda of 657 million was 9 higher than the prior year ebitda from construction materials lifted by 8 to 489 million as a result of higher volumes and prices in most markets building products ebitda of 168 million was 11 above last year due to strong markets in queensland offsetting a decline in western australia as well as a solid lift in timber earnings
5846235 plant capacity utilization is currently around 40 percent in bricks and less than 30 percent in concrete roof tiles reflecting the slowdown in market demand
5846236 the outlook for the balance of 2009 remains positive with onesteels key segments of resources and domestic construction particularly engineering and infrastructure expected to remain strong
5846237 we expect international prices for steel and steelmaking inputs to continue to be volatile but generally remain at high levels by historical standards underpinned by continued strong international demand for steel and steelmaking inputs
5846238 the result highlights the strength of amnesties integrated business model with our major businesses demonstrating their ability to manage well in a volatile cost environment for raw materials ferrous and non ferrous scrap and steel
5846239 we estimate that cost synergies will increase to 80 million gross in the 2009 financial year and that we will reach a run rate of 100 million by the start of the 2010 financial year
5846240 international prices for steel and steelmaking inputs have increased to unprecedented levels in 2008 due to very strong demand the inflationary impact of this has led to a significant increase in working capital at year end
5846241 despite a build up in our working capital position we are confident that this represents an appropriate investment to support our customer service objectives
5846242 no improvement is expected to the domestic manufacturing residential construction and rural segments which will remain relatively weak
5846243 we expect international prices for steel and steelmaking inputs to continue to be volatile but generally remain at high levels by historical standards underpinned by continued strong international demand for steel and steelmaking inputs

5846304 the other way to look at this situation is from a spammers perspective there are approximately 250 million people out there who are interested in these kinds of products and have made purchases from spam in the past thats equivalent to double the population of japan mixed in with every other internet user as a spammer how do you reach that market without knowing specifically who these people are and with the bare minimum of expense easy send lots of emails to everyone

5846325 how many times did planes strike the world trade center before 2001

5846328 its not going to affect public ingress or egress into the building and it will be architecturally similar to the walls we already have that serve that purpose
5846329 its still taxpayer money but for the city budget at least its a pass through item it wont take away money from other programs

5846345 everyone is looking for a more of an iphone blackberry like solution
5846346 you can trick yourself into believing the iphone is not such a big deal if you say there are only 7 million in the world
5846347 but you would be completely wrong because youve got to take into account the engagement levels
5846348 symbian is not dead but it has a limited amount of time to act to capture developer mind share before it is too late

5846353 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5846354 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5846355 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the
5846356 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5846357 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5846358 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field

5846370 people across the country not just in london can see for themselves that after just three months the new tory administration in london is in complete disarray
5846371 the mayor of london has been frank in his opposition to his leaders claim which has always been the most cynical nonsense
5846372 in doing so he has signalled that at least one senior conservative is fed up of david cameron running britain down
5846373 if youre going to take very important political decisions about london transport its absolutely vital the mayor chairs tfl and tim parker agrees with me that thats the way forward
5846374 his exit after just a couple of months in fact confirms the chaos which has existed in boris johnsons administration since day one

5846380 the flora and fauna around us are shifting over time due to climate change
5846381 the result is desynchronisation if birds and the insects upon which they depend do not react in the same way we are headed for an upheaval in the interaction between species
5846382 the response is faster than we thought but it is still not fast enough to keep up with climate change
5846383 is most likely changing at its maximal possible rate which is insufficient to catch up to climate change
5846384 this discrepancy may have profound consequences on the ability of species to cope with climate change in the long run

5846393 london challenge has been very successful it tells us that additional resources and improvement strategies need to be precisely targeted if schools are to receive the right kind of support to raise achievement and in particular to narrow the achievement gap between rich and poor
5846394 it is unacceptable that children have the odds stacked against them simply by default of having poorer parents the government must put its money where its mouth is and end child poverty so that all children no matter their background have equal chances to achieve a decent education
5846395 at gcse the gap in achievement between children from poorer and more affluent backgrounds is narrowing and results for children on free school meals are rising faster than the average since 2002 the percentage of pupils on free school meals achieving five or more a c grades at gcse has risen by 12 5 percentage points in comparison with 9 1 percentage points for pupils not on free school meals
5846396 we have to see which of the two parties has the best candidates on them
5846397 having choices we dont like is no choice at all
5846398 the government may force us to pick from a few health care plans
5846399 it would never occur to tv viewers that harry and louise were talking about anyone new ad which will air during the conventions puts harry and louise back at the kitchen table but this time harry begins by complaining that rising health care costs have got small companies cutting their plans
5846400 you know lisas husband just found out he has cancer
5846401 no he just joined a startup and he cant afford a plan
5846402 whoever the next president is health care should be at the top of his agenda bring everyone to the table make it happen
5846403 sounds like harry and louise have gone liberal on us

5846411 i have never suggested and never will that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition
5846412 i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same

5846437 this project was conceived out of love and loss an opportunity for 25 photographers to bid farewell to a true love while some of the photographers featured in this book shot polaroid for many years others were relatively new to the medium yet what binds us is our unconditional love for the art and the desire to communicate our daydreams in soft love infused light
5846438 the more that you listen to them and think through and understand how they see the world you begin to want to shape your products to see if their ideas will catch fire

5846447 were pretty happy that we came up with rather realistic tumor sizes although this is a very basic model it should give researchers a tool to use when deciding if a particular secreted protein would be a good biomarker
5846448 early cancer detection is a very challenging but important goal for the cancer field this modeling work enables a very deep understanding of the problems that will have to be solved for blood based cancer biomarkers to be successful in this effort

5846458 above and beyond the prediction made by performance on neuropsychological tests if you take into account the degree to which the individual varies in their cognitive abilities theres an independent risk of dementia
5846459 the investigators found that relatively brief measures of memory and executive function reassessed annually would allow physicians to predict of dementia before the patient scores in the clearly impaired range
5846460 this suggests that arsenic would play a role in the development of diabetes
5846461 but there clearly needs to be additional research conducted because our study has certain limitations we are conducting those studies now but thats going to take a few years
5846462 this is a good base for future research but its a small sample size and doesnt look at dose response
5846463 in terms of magnitude people in taiwan and bangladesh are exposed to at least 10 times higher levels compared to people in the u s
5846464 we were interested in investigating if arsenic exposure at low and moderate levels could be related to diabetes
5846465 when we adjusted for diabetes risk factors and for markers of seafood intake we found this moderate to strong relationship between arsenic and the prevalence of diabetes
5846466 there are still many americans with arsenic in drinking water at levels above safety standards
5846467 this reinforces how important it is that all drinking water is below this standard the good news is that we can actually do something to eliminate arsenic from water
5846468 this confirms what a lot of recent studies have found no benefit of taking vitamin b supplements to reduce the risk of heart disease and it raises a few red flags
5846469 we could not detect any preventive effect of intervention with folic acid plus vitamin b12 or with vitamin b6 on mortality or major cardiovascular events
5846470 there is no evidence that individuals should take b vitamins to decrease the risk of heart disease and there may be some evidence that they shouldnt
5846471 the observational data was great but the interventional studies were negative
5846472 we have been optimistic about the role of antioxidants such as vitamin b in preventing heart disease yet many of these large trials have shown that there is no benefit
5846473 immediately treating people who have early stage glaucoma can delay progression of the disease
5846474 james brandt a professor of ophthalmology at uc davis explained the complexity involved with the smart contact lense its very different from situations like cardiac disease or diabetes where patients can wear devices that measure heart rate or blood pressure 24 hours a day for a week or more to get a better idea of whats going on we dont have that for glaucoma and thats one of the biggest clinical frustrations we have
5846475 despite widespread acknowledgement that obesity is endangering the health of millions of americans the country is still failing to respond clearly or comprehensively
5846476 we must work together governments schools and communities to improve nutrition and increase physical activity for all ages we must ensure that strong policies are implemented and enforced in every state not only to help reverse existing obesity rates but to prevent obesity among our nations children and generations to come
5846477 americas future depends on the health of our country the obesity epidemic is lowering our productivity and dramatically increasing our health care costs our analysis shows that we are not treating the obesity epidemic with the urgency it deserves
5846478 even though communities have started taking action considering the scope of the problem the countrys response has been severely limited for significant change to happen combating obesity must become a national priority
5846479 medicare web site is somewhat difficult for people to use
5846480 when e health tools are designed designers really have to think about a broad and inclusive group of users and what their needs and abilities are
5846481 we really have to think who we are designing these web sites for what their needs are and what their capabilities are
5846482 we cant assume that everyone has a sophisticated level of computer skills
5846483 without that information we question the usefulness of the study
5846484 cms has worked to organize and format these tools in a consumer friendly manner by conducting both qualitative and quantitative research of the web site tools with multiple audiences
5846485 the information gathered from testing is used to make improvements to the web site our research is ongoing and the web site continues to make enhancements on an incremental basis
5846486 it would be nice to have an administration more committed to people understanding what their rights are
5846487 the administration could provide better quality services with more accuracy
5846488 in fairness its also true that congress and the bush administration has made so much of medicare so complex that even folks with the best of intentions are going to be misdirecting consumers
5846489 in developing its proposals to make a positive endangerment finding and to regulate the greenhouse gas emissions from both vehicles and stationary sources epa consulted with a wide range of environmental and industry stakeholders
5846490 but others including oil industry representatives from exxonmobil the american petroleum institute and the national petrochemicals and refiners association adopted a
5846491 those arguments were echoed within the white house by vice president cheneys energy adviser f chase hutto iii
5846492 substitute legislative approach to adoption of a near term greenhouse gas emissions cap and trade program
5846493 an anti regulatory philosophy and concern about what regulation means for the american way of life he would talk for example about not wanting greenhouse gas controls to do away with the large american automobile
5846494 primary advisor to the secretary and the department on energy and technology policy development
5846495 there is a concern within this administration which i support that the imposition of a carbon cap in this country would may lead to the transfer of jobs and industry abroad to nations that do not have such a carbon cap
5846496 you would then have the us economy damaged on the one hand and the same emissions potentially even worse emissions
5846497 what would you include in a national energy policy especially with respect to natural gas issues
5846498 a multi pollutant regulatory strategy should be estimated for the power generation sector including gradually phased in mercury nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide emissions reductions reform replacement of nsr use of market based emission trading programs inclusion of both existing and new plants and equal treatment for both
5846499 not all will be done but perhaps some of these ideas could be floated and adopted
5846500 streamline requirements under the clean air act for electric generating facilities while at the same time making major reductions in air emissions
5846501 direct the administrator of the environmental protection agency epa to propose multi pollutant legislation that would establish a flexible market based program to significantly reduce and cap emissions provide regulatory certainty to allow utilities to make modifications to their plants without fear of new litigation provide market based incentives such as emissions trading credits to help achieve the required reductions
5846502 helped scale back a rule proposed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration to protect north atlantic right whales one of the most endangered animals on the planet from lethal ship strikes
5846503 acting on cheneys behalf hutto questioned whether there was sufficient scientific evidence to justify the economic costs that the rule would impose on shippers
5846504 perhaps this is why working in series is so important to photography for to shape a personal vision requires revisiting a subject over many images to create a more focused and particular view rather than relying on the unique aspects of a single image in other words photography is particularly suited to the accumulation of and relationships between many images rather than to the specific imprint on the individual image to create a unique vision or outlook

5846536 the establishment of wuhan university oracle spatial innovation center is a strong cooperation between a prestigious university in china and the worlds largest enterprise software provider
5846537 it will contribute significantly to the improvement of the academic level and r amp d capability of the geo spatial information technology sector in china and chinese consumers will have access to more advanced geo spatial products and services the center is a follow up of the launch of oracle academy program at wuhan university and i believe this foretells further cooperation between our university and oracle corporation
5846538 over the last 30 years r amp d has been at the core of driving oracles innovation and our position at the forefront of information technology it oracle has been increasing its r amp d investments in china and the establishment of three r amp d centres in shenzhen shanghai and beijing respectively is a strong testament of such efforts
5846539 the establishment of the wuhan university oracle spatial innovation center underlines our growing attention on localization and enhanced cooperation with local r amp d institutions we are committed to deliver the most suitable information architecture to our partners and customers in china to address their unique demands
5846540 wuhan university is one of the key universities in china it is the worlds largest base for geoinformatics education and research
5846541 as early as 1999 wuhan university began its exchanges and cooperation with the oracle in the field of spatial database its self developed gis system geostar utilized oracle spatial 8i oracle spatial 9i as the product of the mainstream database platform the establishment of this center will facilitate wuhan university and oracles cooperation on personnel training basic research and technologic development which in turn promotes the development of geoinformatics and spatial database

5846550 organised religion still bears no responsibility for its extremism and the problems its dictators have created
5846551 religion absolves people from blame or the need to fix anything
5846552 the inadequacy is not in the religious message but is in inadequacy of us as people
5846553 you need to believe in something higher in the awe we have spoken about
5846554 a sense of direction emerged which was largely but not universally agreed and which should translate into greater cohesion within the anglican communion giving it stronger boundaries and a stronger sense of identity
5846555 we went into the lambeth conference in a wait and see mode and we came out of it with some encouragement but still waiting
5846556 the importance of the role of the episcopacy the need for authority in the church and a concern for fidelity with the churchs tradition throughout the ages
5846557 subtly suggesting that we bring individuals into the catholic church some may come but what he was asking was that anglicans be attentive to the treasures that lie within their tradition as well as ours
5846558 the situation within the anglican communion in general has become markedly more complex
5846559 bishop odonohue writes of the failure of the catholic bishops of england and wales forthrightly to face the issues of homosexual activism as a body
5846560 disappointment that our bishops conference recently could not agree on a collegial response to the governments legislation on same sex adoption
5846561 attempting to arrive at a consensus among bishops with sometimes divergent views episcopal conference statements and documents have a tendency to be often flat and safe at a time when we need passionate and courageous public statements that dare to speak the full truth in love
5846562 i must admit that during my 15 years as a bishop i have increasingly come to share certain concerns about the relationship between individual bishops and the national conference
5846563 reluctance among the rest of the bishops to speak out on these issues
5846564 results often in the loss of the scandal and the folly of the gospel so that we are no longer the salt and leaven so urgently needed
5846565 confident courageous and prophetic bishops are vital for the well being of the church during this time of increasingly aggressive secularism
5846566 the passion to serve the lord is noticeably absent in many cases there seems to be at times a tiredness and reticence to preach the gospel
5846567 doctrinal and moral teaching in their collaboration with secular agencies
5846568 im thinking in particular of agencies with a responsibility for education or economic development the staff of these agencies are often in a position to witness to the truth of the churchs teaching on say the theology of the body with its positive refutation of pre marital sex safe sex or artificial birth control in their dealings with government departments and committees
5846569 there must be no back peddling on these issues just because certain truths are unwelcome in the corridors of power
5846570 we have talked too much and done too little we have witnessed over the past forty years a growing crisis in the catholic understanding or self identity of the church have we forgotten what it is to be catholic
5846571 the maturity of the pope john paul ii generation will lead i hope to a resurgence of orthodox committed adults in the church gradually renewing vocations to the priesthood religious life and marriage
5846572 what hes saying is what weve all been saying for years but now its a bishop saying it we can use it and quote it and build on it so yes its a very good thing
5846573 the concern was for the image of the institutional church how are we going to look
5846574 what i didnt find was any serious effort to sit down with the families to provide pastoral care to consider the harm that had been done to these victims
5846575 they knew that this man had repeatedly acted out in every assignment in spite of intervention
5846576 but i didnt see any indication that either the pastors or communities were informed
5846577 i would endorse him for any type of assignment for which his training qualifies him including parish work
5846578 the first thing that hit me in the head like a hammer was he was put in charge of altar boys
5846579 although there was medical information all that did was talk about the treatment he tried the main thing that should have been looked at was the pattern of acting out in spite of admonitions in the past and promises to do better he continued to act out
5846580 sex priests and secret codes the catholic churchs 2 000 year paper trail of sexual abuse
5846581 father doyle also became a thorn in the side of the church hierarchy
5846582 its fair to say the average dominican doesnt get paid 300 an hour
5846583 you used to be of the view that treatment was appropriate
5846584 to claim we didnt know what this was all about in the 1960s 1970s 1980s is fairly empty
5846585 my opinion is they were irresponsible decisions i think they were negligent parents would trust their children with priests those who would suffer the most children and families did suffer the most
5846586 both parts of pope john paul iis pontificate were equally important in the first part in which we saw him as a giant of faith with incredible courage extraordinary force a true joy of faith and great lucidity he took the gospel message to the ends of the earth
5846587 however i must say that because of the humble testimony of his passion to my mind these last years of his pontificate were no less important just as he carried the lords cross before us and put into practice the words of the lord
5846588 who had been a master of words thus showed us visibly it seems to me the profound truth that the lord redeemed us with his cross with the passion as an extreme act of his love
5846589 he showed us that suffering is not only a no something negative the lack of something but a positive reality
5846590 he showed us that suffering accepted for love of christ for love of god and of others is a redeeming force a force of love and no less powerful than the great deeds he accomplished in the first part of his pontificate
5846591 in the first part christ teaches the joy of the kingdom of god brings his gifts to men and then in the second part he is immersed in the passion until his last cry from the cross
5846592 in this very way he taught us who god is that god is love and that in identifying with our suffering as human beings he takes us in his arms and immerses us in his love and this love alone bathes us in redemption purification and rebirth
5846593 that thrives on activism on youth on being young strong and beautiful on succeeding in doing great things
5846594 learn the truth of love which becomes a passion and thereby redeems man and unites him with god who is love
5846595 let us therefore pray for all who are suffering and do our utmost to help them to show our gratitude for their suffering and be present to them as much as we can to the very end
5846596 this is a fundamental message of christianity that stems from the theology of the cross the fact that suffering and passion are present in christs love is the challenge for us to unite ourselves with his passion
5846597 we must love those who suffer not only with words but with all our actions and our commitment i think that only in this way are we truly christian
5846598 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
5846599 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
5846600 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
5846601 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
5846602 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
5846603 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
5846604 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
5846605 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
5846606 therefore it is simply ridiculous and wrong to try to silence a pastor accusing him of interfering in politics so that he cannot do good to the soul of a member of his flock
5846607 to bear witness to our faith not only in private in our homes but also in our public lives with others in order to bear strong witness to christ
5846608 a great loss and his contribution and guidance will be missed he was a friendly person who was sensitive to the problems of todays world which he always read in light of the bible he was in love with the word of god it is comforting to know that from heaven he will be participating in the synod he had been actively involved in drafting the instrumentum laboris and death took him by surprise while he was preparing for the synod
5846609 coordinate the work of experts and look after the drafting of proposals and other documents that the synod fathers would vote on
5846610 in order to have such complete work it is necessary to have someone who is a specialist in matters of the synod and bishop egger was certainly such a person
5846611 to become an increasingly larger bible group made up of men and women who under the guidance of the magisterium participate in the prayerful reading of scripture in order to be evangelized and to become evangelizers
5846612 for a lot of male victims theres not a lot of direct services that would be any good to them
5846613 they support you on your journey and you know they listen to you
5846614 those services the ones that probably fall in to what people would think are the light and fluffy services like meditation and gardening and some of the music therapies have all been suggested by survivors
5846615 the aim of the service is to respond to the wishes of survivors
5846616 we have co operated with the authorities since the beginning of the investigation
5846617 it is regrettable when something like this happens our priority and concern is always for the victims
5846618 i jumped out of the car to address this thing knowing i had to address it right then or run from cale yarborough the rest of my life and with that cale went to beating on my fist with his nose
5846619 i am deeply troubled by this matter and understand how devastating the announcement of it is to the brazilian community and to the st pius x parish community
5846620 i wish to assure all of you of my prayers at this difficult time i ask that you remember father lima and the individual who has brought forth this accusation in your prayers
5846621 he was certainly somebody who was dedicated to his ministry and the people he ministered to
5846622 it is good to see a good vision for the future where all social segments are together
5846623 paris would not have been my choice but i was asked to take this move and one of the vows i have made is obedience so i couldnt say no
5846624 there are other priests and ministers who have to change their postings and will not end up in as beautiful a city as i am going to
5846625 i was seven years in rome before i came here and when i was asked to come to belfast i thought it was the maddest suggestion it has ended up being the best seven years of my life as a priest and i have no hesitation in saying that

5846628 newman repeatedly made it clear that he wanted to be buried next to his life long partner ambrose st john no one gave the pope permission to defy newmans wishes the re burial has only one aim in mind to cover up newmans homosexuality and to disavow his love for another man it is an act of shameless dishonesty and personal betrayal by the gay hating catholic church
5846629 now cardinal newmans great friendship with ambrose st john is being slyly suggested as evidence of his being subject to a disordered sexuality the utter absurdity of this idea speaks for itself
5846630 there is little doubt that newman and st john were gay and had a loving long term same sex relation ship it is impossible to know whether this relationship involved sex it is conceivable that both men had a gay orientation but chose to abstain from sex abstinence does not alter a persons sexual orientation
5846631 the bodies do not lie side by side the coffins are separated by about three feet of earth
5846632 were going to have some issues here in florida we are going to have to be borrowing money to pay claims
5846633 at the end of the day we floridians will be paying taxes for 30 years of pretty significant amounts to be able to cover those losses
5846634 the states insurance company can charge inadequate rates because if they dont have enough money to pay claims they can come to our people and tax them we dont have the power to do that
5846635 finally pregnant i can t believe it is this for real

5846652 sleight of hand optical illusion ventriloquism puppets balloons clowning juggling storytelling and other visual arts
5846653 many people will come to see a woman get cut in half that would never set foot in a church building otherwise
5846654 weve surrendered the arts to the secular world for far too long
5846655 the magic that its speaking of is trying to speak to the dead or cast spells on people
5846656 what i do is sleight of hand its literally optical illusion its not what the bible forbids at all
5846657 objects of any kind are valuable to use in teaching lessons but when the objects are used in such a way that a mystery results the interest is not only more fully aroused but also the lesson connected with the mystery is more indelibly stamped upon the mind
5846658 all of a sudden i could create stories visual events that made people go ooh aah isnt that neat it was a very happy thing for me
5846659 the surprise ending in magic is indeed very much like the effect that jesuss parables had on his audience
5846660 i carry tons of equipment in order to do my shows
5846661 if jesus was a magician youd have to visualize 2 000 years ago jesus and the disciples walking through the dusty streets of galilee wearing sandals with three diesel trucks behind them carrying all their equipment
5846662 a lot of folks want the supernatural they want something special
5846663 they want to believe in something but they dont know which way to go you put the right thing in front of them and give them half a reason to go for it and they will
5846664 can you talk a little about posing staging pausing for applause things like that
5846665 and if you do something that others enjoyed you ought to let them thank you its just a matter of keeping your heart right
5846666 im trying to grow the sport and take it to a new level and try to get more people involved in it i think the first step in doing that is trying to get kids to feel comfortable in the water and be water safe
5846667 we saw people from lebron to kobe to president bush to bill gates we saw literally so many people that were in the stands cheering us on i think this sport is really starting to take off its just an honor to be part of it and to help this sport grow and attract new faces to it
5846668 sometimes i have a hard time staying focused and getting myself to go to practice did you ever feel like that and how did you overcome it
5846669 growing up i played a bunch of other sports once i really focused on the sport of swimming i was able to set so many goals and time standards that i wanted to get to and achievements i wanted to do and i was always focused on those its just something that i love
5846670 did you have to sacrifice to do this kind of sport
5846671 the biggest thing was in high school when your friends would go out on a friday or saturday and stay out late there were some things that i did give up but for me i wanted to have the opportunity to do something that no one else has ever done before
5846672 and have the kind of opportunities that im having right now because theyre priceless opportunities and amazing memories and moments that ill have for the rest of my life
5846673 beijing will raise power rates and fuel prices again this year the government may also find other ways to support power producers to ensure stable power supply
5846674 compared with the power production market the power grid sector is much more consolidated so its relatively easy for the government to compensate those power grids
5846675 after careful consideration our board rejected the offer after concluding that their proposal was not in the best interest of our stockholders the board believes the 5 25 offering price does not reflect the value of heelys and that entering into discussions with skechers based on their unsolicited proposal is premature at this time

5846683 we had just pulled up to the dock and some kids came over and said hey weve got a fish over here with two mouths
5846684 it was really unusual the fish has an obvious abnormality i had never seen anything like that myself before i cant speculate on what might have caused it
5846685 it was important for the fish to be displayed at the conference to show people what we have been claiming all along
5846686 people were in disbelief here they saw a fish that we suspect is very much linked to tarsands development and contamination of the athabasca river our elders tell us that what happens to the animals and the fish is just a sign of what is going to happen to human life
5846687 for the most part what we have been getting is natural parasites and fin erosion which are normal in sand bed rivers
5846688 throughout the 12 years there has been no significant impact shown from oilsands development
5846689 it is very heavily represented by industry and government and we feel that it doesnt do any justice as far as accurately representing any data to the community
5846690 this is evidence and we need to ensure that is preserved
5846691 some of the community concern was that even if they were bringing them in fish for testing i dont think ramp was doing a great job in communicating back to those individuals about the testing

5846718 to have insured nearly a half million people in less than two years is nothing short of remarkable
5846719 the significant reduction in free care through the health safety net provides further evidence that health care reform is having its intended effect

5846737 twenty one is not working alcohol education that mandates abstinence as the only legal option has not resulted in significant constructive behavioral change among our students adults under 21 are deemed capable of voting signing contracts serving on juries and enlisting in the military but are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5846738 americas future depends on the health of our country the obesity epidemic is lowering our productivity and dramatically increasing our health care costs our analysis shows that were not treating the obesity epidemic with the urgency it deserves
5846739 even though communities have started taking action considering the scope of the problem the countrys response has been severely limited for significant change to happen combating obesity must become a national priority
5846740 despite widespread acknowledgement that obesity is endangering the health of millions of americans the country is still failing to respond clearly or comprehensively
5846741 we must work together governments schools and communities to improve nutrition and increase physical activity for all ages we must ensure that strong policies are implemented and enforced in every state not only to help reverse existing obesity rates but to prevent obesity among our nations children and generations to come
5846742 the report shows the serious impact that the obesity crisis is having on our countrys health and economic well being
5846743 we need to continue to work to create a real push towards reversing the obesity epidemic it is time we make it a national priority
5846744 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5846745 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5846746 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5846747 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5846748 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5846749 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5846750 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5846751 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5846752 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence

5846756 silicon images product comes at the right time as the number of tvs and other consumer facing devices capable of receiving video over an ip network continues to grow
5846757 while silicon images technology could be used to enable multi room dvrs its real benefit could be its ability to help get cable providers content and applications to multiple consumer devices

5846764 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama

5846772 our new ix104c4 has the best indoor outdoor viewable display in the market today and signifies another milestone for xplore as we continue to innovate in the rugged tablet computing segment
5846773 the xplore tablet is a champion in design and the newest generation is no exception
5846774 we tested the new ix104c4 and experienced 20 greater performance than other rugged products
5846775 with the challenges todays companies face the need for rugged computing devices has grown significantly based on customer input and the needs of our target markets we developed the ix104c4 to be a computing tool to address the difficult extremes of any situation in the field on a forklift in a vehicle on a mobile cart or in a tank
5846776 we wanted to develop a product that would adapt to our customers ever changing situations with enhanced benefits and we have proudly accomplished that task with the ix104c4

5846778 we talked about how can we simplify it as a group i think that the guys had a real good grasp of this offense and i told eric and i told schotty this from day one that its a lot easier for one to get on board with ten than ten to get on board with one
5846779 that being said i felt like maybe there were some things that i was successful in the past that i could offer to the team without tearing the playbook up and without going with a new one im working my butt off on it and well see what happens

5846783 for me as a player id have some animation back at him but this is a different day and age i would relish facing a guy like that to be honest with you he better hope i never hit a home run because id pimp him worse than he pimps us every time he makes an out when he shoves it up peoples butts i guess he can do what he wants
5846784 if we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart then we will misunderstand this moment and miss its opportunities
5846785 if we think that we can use the same partisan politics where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great

5846800 i really have not he certainly hasnt either when i say were pushing the thing like were getting ready for saturday i understand the urgency if it was a regular season game but were treating it as if its a regular season game so i want to see how far he can come in that period of time what faculties he has as he goes in there
5846801 in fact we had a plan in place where wed play these guys through the half and we were talking about the fact that gus needed some snaps with the number ones
5846802 i know its easy for me to say after tarvaris gets hurt but he needed some snaps as opposed to having the second team offensive and wide receivers to throw to that he was able to throw to the no 1 guys so we actually were going to bring him out after the half with the ones in this game perhaps hell get a chance to start with the ones well just have to see when we get to saturday
5846803 hes had about every test that we know of and the doctors know of
5846804 its just hes uncomfortable with sticking the foot in the ground and breaking straight ahead stuff is ok its not a deal where two weeks rest has made the difference weve tried three or four days rest he went and saw a specialist again today we feel like were treating it right its just a matter of it settling down everybody heals different

5846816 many 20th century modernists disdained craftsmanship in favor of deploying industrial technology to design for the masses even though much of marcel breuer and le corbusiers early
5846817 perhaps surprisingly computer programming conforms to the classic arts and crafts movement definition of a work being made by one pair of hands
5846818 what most people dont understand about the proverbial modern geek
5846819 is that we have just as much of an interest in adult products as anyone else one only has to spend a couple of hours witnessing the debauchery that occurs during the evening hours at such conventions to understand this
5846820 in years past the convention welcomed various types of adult oriented panel discussions and seminars on such topics as 2257 web cam girls and various alternative sexual lifestyles
5846821 unfortunately due to a more conservative leadership at dragon con many of these bits of programming have gone by the wayside in recent years
5846822 thats one of the origins of consluts com and our parties we intend to bring back such adult oriented fun in a private safe and sane environment
5846823 the consluts party is a unique way to introduce our product to a targeted mainstream audience

5846826 yappo is happy to be part of consluts after the gamers are done slaying dragons we help them relax its a win win
5846827 cos its all about the romance and theres nothing more romantic than a legally binding contract
5846828 louis is off there gallivanting around the amazon he calls the office at 5 pm right during my busiest hour ive got 12 patients in the waiting room he forces my secretary to interrupt me i dont have a moment to breath the phone connection is terrible i cant hear three quarters of what hes saying and hes going on and on about something or another he needs me to do for him expecting me to drop everything for him at that moment
5846829 so what did he tell you when he called back
5846830 probably forgot whatever it was that seemed so important to him at the moment
5846831 you know louis hes just forgotten what responsibility is living the good life traveling everywhere he just doesnt know what it means for someone to have a schedule any more
5846832 boy is that finkelstein a pip i needed him to check something out for me awhile ago about the deadline on my chiropractic license renewal im in the middle of the amazon i have to travel upstream out of this village for two days on a broken down boat with this half drunk toothless capitan just to get to a pay phone ive got to punch it a half dozen times to get it two work it then takes me two hours to get an operator on the line who speaks english i finally get marty on the phone and would you believe it he hangs up on me
5846833 well you know marty he just lives in his own little world hasnt really done any extensive traveling since getting into practice just forgot what it means to try to make a simple phone call sometimes when youre out of the country
5846834 one snap of his jaws and my neck would have been broken like a chickens
5846835 so you dont believe it was the tigers intention to kill you then what was he doing dragging you across the stage with your throat in his mouth
5846836 if you look closely at the video of the incident
5846837 youll see quite clearly that the tiger didnt knock me down youll see that i fell to the ground
5846838 i have high blood pressure i believe at that moment i had a stroke i raised montecore the tiger since he was a cub and as certain as i know that im still breathing i know montecore dragged me because he knew i was injured this was simply his attempt to get me off stage to help
5846839 there are no bad feelings whatsoever if anything i love him the tiger more
5846840 i always complained about not having any shoes until i met a man who had no feet
5846841 sometimes god can dream a bigger dream for us than we can dream for ourselves
5846842 it is the wounded child in everyone who seeks to bring hope and restoration to a relationship where abandonment has occurred yet you chose to rise above your pain and love her anyway and one never knows how long we are given to make wrongs right upon the earth but you can do so now with peace in your heart
5846843 i think everyone in the world should read them i finished my second tour of the book last night and now i am moving on to the rest of the series my dad and your dad are in right now i can just hear them now
5846844 this hit a special place in my heart as i
5846845 the one thing i have learned about human nature is its phenomenal ability to go into denial rather than be responsible for ones own behavior
5846846 you could figure it out because your background as a holistic doctor has taught you that most human beings cannot resist the temptation of love and sex
5846847 people sometimes would rather die than admit to being wrong
5846848 nobody appreciates i had never been thanked enough i had always been repaid with indiference
5846849 hey my monthly pizza arrived without mushrooms and onions under the cheese
5846850 what is the missing piece from your life and most peoples lives that may be causing you my friend to live a life of quiet desperation
5846851 what is the missing piece from your life that may be causing you james to live a life of quiet desperation
5846852 i dont know what you ever saw in her she was a flake from the beginning
5846853 let me tell you the general hospital version of our family
5846854 who is this person who makes such an large statement
5846855 if i die here in my house all alone no one will know and there is no one to take care of my children
5846856 splitting them up would be devastating to them on top of the potential devastation of the loss of their mother
5846857 the fear and uncertainty for them is a horrible thought
5846858 let he who is without sin cast the first stone
5846859 no they are the sons and daughters of the priests and nuns they are supposed to be celibate
5846860 when the p m a positive mental attitude is allowed to prevail love does as well eliminating being s o b
5846861 love me love my warts and i will do likewise for you
5846862 mining the moment for something that feels good something to appreciate something to savor something to take in thats what your moments are about
5846863 so im not good enough smart enough pretty enough popular enough
5846864 change the way you see not the way you look
5846865 so you can be on your own so you can support yourself financially and love what youre doing
5846866 i need to live here so i can own so i dont dive into uncertainty so i dont do something scary or over my head
5846867 you say you still love me and if you do please release me
5846868 i bet you have a good reason for feeling that way
5846869 i dont want my children ever to have to experience the grief of losing someone they love as much as i loved my parents
5846870 i bet you have a good reason for feeling that way
5846871 the spirit of liberty is that which is not absolutely certain it is right
5846872 youve got to check out this group they get high by climbing mountains
5846873 no matter how flat the pancake is there are still two sides
5846874 just wait till it snows chip wont shovel the snow only a path from his door to the garage
5846875 no ever since i was diagnosed with cancer two years ago the doctor told me not to shovel snow
5846876 turn around and go the other way then youll be chasing him
5846877 god why you didnt help me when i desperetely was crying and praying for your help i so beleaved in you
5846878 i sended a boat yau didnt go i sended a helicopter you didnt go
5846879 guys i cant handle this on my own its over to you

5846884 i wish i could borrow your body for just one day michael then i could eat whatever id like
5846885 we create our own heaven or hell your thoughts can imprison you or set you free complications conditions or people do not upset you but the way you think about them causes your upset freedom is not possible until we discipline and retrain our minds
5846886 when you feel frustrated or upset by a person or a situation remember that you are not reacting to the person or the situation but to your feelings beliefs about the person or the situation
5846887 every step i have taken was to bring me closer to you
5846888 i wish i knew at that age what shaun knows
5846889 the riptides if theyre around at all only pull you out to shoulder deep water and ive only seen a shark inside the breakers once and he was a small one
5846890 so when will you let go of what you dont want so you can have what you really do want if all stories are invented why not pick one or design one that really works for yourself
5846891 even though you may want to move forward in your life you may have one foot on the brakes in order to be free we must learn how to let go release the hurt release the fear refuse to entertain your old pain the energy it takes to hang onto the past is holding you back from a new life what is it you would let go of today
5846892 any day six feet above ground is a good day
5846893 the beauty in the midst of it was so staggering
5846894 god knows amp cares about our problems and wants to help if we will just believe in him amp let him
5846895 god loves us very much and wants us to be happy
5846896 if i tell you you would say that i am crazy
5846897 the beauty in the midst of it was so staggering
5846898 god a higher power the universe the loving spirit of my husband or whatever you choose to call it
5846899 it is too pretty a day to be so unhappy did you fall down
5846900 now what is this man going to try to get from her
5846901 she once fell clean off her wooden shoes now look at her
5846902 in that moment i changed from a girl facing nothing but emptiness to someone with a purpose
5846903 i just ordered the books last night so have not
5846904 why would you want to go to a move that demoralizes women and all that we have worked so hard to change
5846905 if you were willing to go to jail for the child i should be willing to kick drugs for her
5846906 i sought my god but my god i could not see i sought myself but myself eluded me i sought my brother and found all three
5846907 you know its a good thing youre working with this produce instead of me because id be making faces out of the vegetables i just wouldnt be able to contain myself
5846908 all i have seen teaches me to trust the creator for all i have not seen
5846909 mom let me leave you with this maybe hes healed
5846910 either he is going to be around forever or he is never going to come eat at hardees again
5846911 peace i leave with you my peace i give to you do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid
5846912 dear creator tomorrow i am supposed to go help someone take a bath problem is it is a 1 hr job and it will take me 45 minutes each way on bus and wait time
5846913 does evil exist and if it does do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it do we defeat it
5846914 el no a la privatizaci n es una posici n muy definida y reiterada exhaustivamente
5846915 sabemos que la responsabilidad de legislar est en quienes nos representan en el congreso de la uni n el comit nacional estar acompa ando a sus legisladores
5846916 siempre hemos dicho que en cualquier reforma es importante tomar en cuenta a los trabajadores
5846917 brand new dungeons and an arena mode that add exciting new dimensions
5846918 clearly there is frenzy around this good long term planning will get us out of it nothing less
5846919 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5846920 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5846921 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5846922 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5846923 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5846924 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5846925 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5846926 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5846927 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5846928 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
5846929 i was just ecstatic going on off a walk off at the little league world series
5846930 i was thinking that i had to shorten up my swing and get a hit so we could win
5846931 the airline is taking good care of this soldier heading home on leave
5846932 we are carrying the remains of cpl brock bucklin home he was killed in action in iraq and his twin brother brad is accompanying him back
5846933 the reality of that is etched in my mind forever
5846934 i was engrossed in looking out the window and when i turned back and saw what was happening i was angry and disappointed i knew then that we had to do something to first bond with those people that stayed on that airplane but maybe more importantly we had to reach the people who got off
5846935 because theres something very wrong when we cant spend 30 minutes of our life to honor the incredible sacrifices that these members of our military and their families are making
5846936 weve been able to give hundreds of scholarships to spouses
5846937 whether its getting secretarial skills or cosmetology school or some kind of vocation so they can get those skills and assume that role of bread winner and provide for their family financially
5846938 big cats and dinosaurs if you see any of those give us a call
5846939 when i see patients die in such conditions i become depressed for a week and want to isolate myself from the rest of the world
5846940 in 2001 members of the inbound tour operators council itoc signed formal written agreements with the ird about the gst tax treatment of the fees they charge to overseas wholesalers for arranging tours the ird advised in the formal written agreements that the fees should be zero rated and the industry has followed this advice now however seven years later the ird has advised the industry that it has changed its mind apparently because it believes it made an error in a meeting with the industry last week top ird officials said they would not honour the formal written agreements signed with the industry in 2001 and would now seek back taxes
5846941 i guess we the starters are going to play the most we have played in the preseason i thought last game against dallas our intensity and our tempo was there so hopefully we can carry that over into this game
5846942 hes mastered the gameplan he has a great feel for defenses hes been with a lot of different systems so he has a good feel of what we are trying to do he has a good feel for just gameplans in general he is flexible and thats what i like most about him if i have an idea i ask him about it and talk to him about it and if he likes it and we can agree on it we will put it in it has been give and take and i have enjoyed it so far
5846943 any quarterback is going to be kind of the face of the community the face of the program there is a lot of pressure on you youre pulling the trigger and youre making things happen so thats why they pay you a lot of money its a lot of pressure but i enjoy it and obviously things are going well right now
5846944 you have to be a little bit surprised you have the little guy wr eddie royal out there and hes playing well picking up the offense wr brandon marshall is doing great things the offensive line we have all new guys up there we have tommy c casey wiegmann in we have two guys on the outside the tackles t ryan harris playing at a high level running backs anybody we are putting in there is rushing the ball well just the volume of plays and the formations we are throwing at them its been incredible how everyone has picked it up
5846945 yeah eddie royal is falling right into place he listens if i tell him something he is going to do it right after the play if i want to tweak it or if i want to back shoulder him i just talk to him about it and the next play he does it it is going well when brandon gets out of his suspension we are going to need him and we are going to need a couple other guys to step up because it is going to be hard to replace what brandon does for us on the field
5846946 i have been talking to aaron since the whole thing has blown up i met him in tahoe when things started getting crazy for him i think he is handling it great he is a down to earth guy he understands the situation and he is playing well right now i wish him the best of luck and i am excited to see him play
5846947 jake we obviously didnt make as big of a deal of retirement as brett favre did he kind of went quietly and that is the type of guy jake is a first class guy he understood what was going on and he kind of wanted out anyway i cant imagine being in that situation having a guy like brett favre with what he has done on the field and all of his accomplishments taking over for him it is a tough situation it is like the guys that had to take over for john elway and dan marino it is tough they are always going to be there and you are always going to hear about brett favre as long as he is in a uniform
5846948 i met him a few times when we played and when i was down in tahoe he is a good guy he is cool we talk every once in awhile a couple times a week just to see how things are going if he throws a pick i give him some trouble and if i throw a pick vice versa he will probably send me a couple text messages
5846949 that is not necessarily true if you go back and watch a lot of clips from three four or five years ago youll see a lot of empty sets they were throwing the ball all over the place especially with john elway they threw their fair share of deep balls in empty sets right now with our running game when we get in those sets you are going to see limited amounts of defenses they have to prepare for our run and that kind of limits their blitz and what they can do if we go empty with their checks and stuff as long as we are running the ball we are going to be able to do things like that
5846950 i dont know if brandon has ever been covered on third downs if we ever go into a three receiver set and he gets in there he is the guy that they have to cover and that is not an easy task for any nickel guy he understands what we are trying to get done and he understands the defenses and where the openings are at its fun having him out there especially for a guy like eddie royal and even for a guy like brandon marshall because he has been around the league and he has been around some great offenses
5846951 we thought it was the answer to a mystery thats been going on for too long
5846952 at a high rate of speed and crossing the painted double yellow lines

5846954 our goal was to try to get personalities and artists who are in the target range of our target consumer
5846955 when i got on i was only ordered to pay 114 a month because the courts couldnt determine how much money i was gonna make
5846956 i was like what the hell is that who can survive on that as far as it looked to them i didnt have a job but i was paying more than what was ordered and something came up one day and she came to me and said i think we need to sit down and talk because i need more money
5846957 we came up with an agreement i was paying 2000 a month i would take care of all his medical issues expenses extracurricular activities anything to do with my son and that was the agreement and i never missed a payment
5846958 do you want to see more independent films in theaters
5846959 how do we now cut through the clutter of hollywood blockbusters
5846960 its a way i can manage my contacts from all the positions ive had
5846961 i feel like i have access to my business contacts and their contacts at my fingertips to pull in resources when i need them
5846962 us box office is a tiny piece of the pie compared to international rights and home video
5846963 the way that were going to turn a profit is through international showings weve already grossed half a million dollars in the uk box office our opening week in greece we were the number 7 film in the nation we sold every ticket for every screening for a week we sold the theatrical rights in spain scandinavia poland turkey israel

5846974 the u s considers japans syndicates to be the worlds largest and is more wary of them than are the japanese themselves
5846975 there is always the notion over why the japanese government lets this vicious mafia run rampant americans are also of the impression that the gangs will act as a hindrance to their economic activities in japan
5846976 of several hundreds of billions of yen in investments even if just 1 were to flow into the yakuzas coffers their crookedness would stand out
5846977 some americans might tend to lump regular japanese businessmen with yakuza and regard such people as sinister but theres no evidence to support this so they assemble whatever information they can with the aim of stirring up trouble
5846978 one hundred percent of foreign journalists are convinced that the yakuza are the same type of criminal organization as the mafia
5846979 to some extent such a misperception should be obvious since they know nothing about the yakuzas history if you go back to their formative period youre talking about 500 years ago
5846980 jake adelstein the writer of the first article about the gang leaders liver transplant in the washington post on may 11 was a former reporter for one of japans biggest newspapers
5846981 he had mentioned in an interview that he was preparing to include it in an upcoming book
5846982 tokyo vice an american reporter on the police beat in japan
5846983 up to now the japanese police have only provided the names and dates of birth of about 50 yakuza members despite the fact that there are about 80 000 of them in total

5847020 i love horror films not just because i crave the goose bump factor of a good evisceration but also because horror is one of the most metaphorically rich genres of the post modern age
5847021 horror is an allegory for existence teeth takes a bite out of sexism in society the last winter fast forwards to the rising tide of global warming even the granddaddy of modern monster movies jaws indicts the pettiness of business interests determined to keep the beaches open no matter whats in the water horror intimately reflects who we are what we want and what scares the capri pants off us from hamlet to hostel horror is as fundamental to human existence as comedy and tragedy its like beckett only with disemboweling whats not to love

5847033 lo importante es por cu nto ganar la senadora con una diferencia de 10 puntos por encima de obama la senadora podr seguir la carrera pero si est por debajo de los 5 puntos entonces habr presiones para que se retire y no divida m s al partido
5847034 hillary es una luchadora ella quiere seguir la carrera hasta el final y sabemos que los clinton no toman un no como respuesta el problema sin embargo es que se quede sin dinero y entonces tendr que darse cuenta que no puede seguir

5847037 que importancia tiene la vida y qu importancia tienen los autos la vida deber a estar primero y luego los veh culos pero para ellos los pa ses productores de etanol est n primero los autos y luego la vida
5847038 estas pol ticas que se implementan ya tienen un impacto negativo sobre la humanidad los precios de los alimentos se han incrementado especialmente el trigo que bien significa el pan tenemos problemas con eso en bolivia pero no es un problema interno sino externo
5847039 en las cumbres internacionales haremos un vigoroso llamado a los pa ses m s grandes y ricos de la tierra para limitar con prudencia esta reconversi n de las tierras al etanol

5847045 los cocineros espa oles que estamos aqu competimos mucho pero ante todo somos grandes amigos somos como familia en otras disciplinas los diez de arriba ni se hablan
5847046 adem s hay que recordar que la gastronom a no es s lo la parte l dica de elite sino tambi n la alimentaci n la salud y espa a se est convirtiendo en un l der en ese sentido

5847052 el futuro de la gastronom a est en latinoam rica
5847053 no s lo por los productos sino tambi n por la manera de encarar la vida
5847054 al rev s de lo que ha ocurrido en espa a am rica latina necesita todav a hacer la revoluci n de los cocineros
5847055 todav a en argentina hay que comer asados en brasil la feijoada y en per la causa pero hace falta que los cocineros hagan su propia cocina
5847056 como ocurre con los pintores o los escultores unas veces ser n mejores y otras peores pero si se limitan a copiar la cocina regional popular tradicional o a hacer lo que se llamaba la alta cocina francesa nunca ser n artistas ser n puros artesanos y eso no emociona a nadie
5847057 en espa a en estos momentos hay grandes cocineros hay restaurantes muy creativos muy divertidos muy interesantes

5847062 we told the airlines we would allow them if someone gave a birth date to exclude that person from the list
5847063 let the person get their boarding pass directly at home or at the kiosk just like everyone else some airlines have done this some have chosen not to because they dont want to spend the money
5847064 and their attitude is well tsa gets the blame for it so i guess if they can do what they are doing now with food and can charge you for it but i hate to suggest that i may give them an idea
5847065 we are now awaiting tsas announced january 2009 implementation of the secure flight program which is expected to reduce the number of misidentified passengers
5847066 in the meantime the airlines worked collaboratively with tsa to further minimize unnecessary passenger inconvenience a key part of that short term solution relies on frequent flier program enrollment to help resolve misidentification issues and as a result we are urging passengers to enroll
5847067 we have done a thorough investigation and were confident the restaurant is not the source

5847129 the edmund rice centre welcomes the australian governments announcement of its pacific guest worker scheme
5847130 pacific island nations have been asking for a scheme like this for a long time and the government is to be congratulated for listening to their calls
5847131 the three year trial makes a welcome companion scheme to australias small vocational training initiatives that are increasing the number of skilled workers in the pacific
5847132 in our discussions the president made it clear that a well designed labour access scheme is not just about stopping australian fruit from rotting on the vine nor is it just about getting a job
5847133 for kiribati it will build up work skills send remittances home and make a dent in high youth unemployment and unrest
5847134 most australians would not be aware of just how carefully and generously those remittances are shared out among the island community
5847135 but most importantly labour access is one of the strategies that low lying island nations are calling for to help them prepare for the inevitable loss of land and livelihood that climate change is bringing them
5847136 the criticism some have levelled at the scheme that australian indigenous unemployment should take precedence over the situation of pacific island indigenous people is an unfair pitting of one group against another
5847137 this information is knowledge every woman should have every woman needs to understand how to recognise the fertile and infertile phases of her menstrual cycle
5847138 she can use this knowledge to avoid pregnancy without the side effects of medication or devices alternatively she can maximise her chances for achieving pregnancy naturally with fertility education the choice is hers
5847139 women today are under a lot of pressure juggling career and family commitments
5847140 they need to be able to make choices confident they are not compromising their potential to have a family this is what fertility education can do
5847141 fertility education along with pap smears and breast scans is one of the must dos for good sexual and reproductive healthcare it is no surprise that women hear about the benefits of fertility education from other women women who appreciate being empowered to control their own fertility
5847142 it is impossible for asian diocesan priests to organise such an informal gathering without the fabcs support and the thai bishops permission
5847143 no priest can say he belongs to this or that country
5847144 no chance to go out to know what is happening outside his diocese and update himself with modern trends or other priests thinking
5847145 recently a priest was killed in nepal and 10 priests were receiving death threats they are living under fear but who is there to support them
5847146 all of our ornaments are handcrafted in our studio using materials that would have been available in the 1920s amp 30s or as close to it as possible we also incorporate as much actual vintage material as we can find all of our dresdens are made by a company in germany that has been producing them since 1861 the company still used the same machinery and the same dies to stamp them so are they actually reproductions or are they vintage hmmmm good question most of our plaster items are made using antique or vintage candy molds some of the molds we have made ourselves all of our designs are original and we get our ideas from actual vintage halloween items old magazines catalogs and the like

5847189 overall obama holds a narrow edge over the arizona senator 45 to 43 which falls within the polls margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points in june obama was ahead by 12 points other polls at that time showed him with a narrower lead
5847190 more striking than the head to head matchup however is the drop in obamas favorable rating in the run up to his selection of a running mate and the democratic national convention next week in denver
5847191 obamas favorable rating has sunk to 48 from 59 since the last times bloomberg poll in june

5847194 like billy graham warren knows that liberals mistake his kind spiritedness for moderation
5847195 in fact warren stands side by side with the hardest right wing of fundamentalism theological point by point but hes a much better salesman
5847196 initially i was concerned it would be a feel good affair without tough questions asked by warren the promo mentioned leadership environment poverty and so on as topics to be discussed it turned out to be a very good forum with warren asking a lot of insightful questions
5847197 im going to ask them about abortion i am going to ask them about the definition of marriage but im also going to ask them about more than that

5847207 he has served the city well in a lot of ways and worked harder than many of us
5847208 but im starting to feel like im part of a charade i hope youll step down if you dont live here
5847209 seventeen months ago i started with staff and was directed to follow the general plan process
5847210 theres not an application so we cant talk about it

5847217 i worked some 30 years for the county and i feel that citizens have a right to be heard
5847218 its generally seen by the board as a fair process and a fair requirement
5847219 on our opening day we had a lot of good reactions
5847220 i thought the adults would come in and say oh this is so cute but a lot of adults took it seriously it made us feel better
5847221 our earth is deteriorating and as much as we try to convey the message were still going to be using our cars were still going to be wasting our energy by showing people this exhibit it will educate people about what we can do
5847222 one idea is to have a lot of murals and public art
5847223 we were working with artists who really believed that art could bring the community together we wanted to bring together different cultures through public art we set up an outdoor stage for performers
5847224 there was this one girl who was into bringing a lot of culture i was interested in bringing technology it was interesting bringing all these ideas into one plan
5847225 an acute care hospital which will continue to provide for the health care needs of the entire community
5847226 we are not unaware of councils policy in regard to this property
5847227 but we need to discuss if its still relevant its a physically obsolete structure
5847228 the project youre proposing challenges our hillsides i dont want to see anything poking up
5847229 at six stories it definitely would indicate a shift in thinking
5847230 when we started palo alto everyone was concerned about the same issues you are it turned out to be a grand slam home run
5847231 the sweet spot for us is 250 to 300 units
5847232 our operations are funded by monthly fees in order to keep fees reasonable we need a certain number of units two hundred units would not provide the services we are known for
5847233 it sounds like its a one time bump in property taxes for los gatos

5847255 kenapa tokoh2 muslim di indonesia tdk belajar dari ulama2 islam di negara maju utk bagaimana mengislamkan orang2 intelek kristen
5847256 hal semacam itu sudah biasa tapi belakangan ini makin banyak kaum perempuan yang memiliki pendirian sendiri

5847297 there is a dangerous tendency to accept in afghanistan practices which would not be countenanced elsewhere because of cultural differences and local traditions
5847298 they are very aware of the inequality in the system

5847301 the russians are alcohol sodden barbarians but now and then they vomit up a genius the empire of the czars hasnt produced such a frightening genius since joseph stalin
5847302 the new reality is that a nuclear cash rich and energy blessed russia doesnt really worry too much whether its long term future is bleak given problems with muslim minorities poor life expectancy rates and a declining population instead in the here and now it has a window of opportunity to reclaim prestige and weaken its adversaries
5847303 you know that our countrys population is declining by an average of almost 700 000 people a year we have raised this issue on many occasions but have for the most part done very little to address it first we need to lower the death rate second we need an effective migration policy and third we need to increase the birth rate

5847352 one of the aims of this project is to come up with a strategy that isnt very expensive
5847353 a trust needs to have a small staff and be able to broker relationships with people being able to marshal initiatives within the local community
5847354 the strategy i think is to offer the owners something that actually solves a problem for them and the fact that their buildings are falling apart and decaying losing value and generating bad will
5847355 what does it leave behind i have tried to show that once it passes through everything we are left with stronger sounder versions of our most important ideas some of the traditional details perish and some of these are losses to be regretted but what remains is more than enough to build on

5847368 todays leading thinkers and writers grapple with the escalating tensions and pitfalls of americas expanding global political and military reach
5847369 in this utterly original book andrew bacevich explains how our empire of consumption contains the seeds of its own destruction and why our foreign policy establishment in washington is totally incapable of coming to grips with it indispensable reading for every citizen
5847370 a clear eyed look into the abyss of americas failed wars and the analysis needed to climb out in andrew bacevich realism and moral vision meet
5847371 in the limits of power andrew bacevich takes aim at americas culture of exceptionalism and scores a bulls eye
5847372 andrew bacevich has written a razor sharp dissection of the national myths which befuddle u s approaches to the outside world and fuel the washington establishments dangerous delusions of omnipotence his book should be read by every concerned us citizen
5847373 in the limits of power andrew bacevich delivers precisely what the republic has so desperately needed an analysis of americas woes that goes beyond the villain of the moment george w bush and gets at the heart of the delusions that have crippled the countrys foreign policy for decades bacevich writes with a passionate eloquence and moral urgency that makes this book absolutely compelling everyone should read it

5847381 no mistake i am here to ask the southern baptist convention and all of you in this room for your help the department of justice has many tools to protect religious freedoms in this country and we are using them but even with all of our passion and our dedication to this cause we cannot do it alone
5847382 we are pleased to see the bush administration focus renewed interest on religious freedom
5847383 find it unsettling that only a single denomination representing a fraction of the rich diversity of religious life of america was selected to receive the attorney generals personal presentation it would seem more appropriate had he made such an appearance before an ecumenical or interfaith gathering symbolically underlining the vision of a nation in which the law plays no favorites but sees all faiths as equal before the constitution
5847384 the first amendment has two protections for religious freedom prohibition on religious establishments and protection for free exercise of religion
5847385 the administration has often ignored the importance of the no establishment principle by supporting attempts of governments to endorse a religious message using tax dollars to fund pervasively religious organizations allowing religious discrimination in hiring for federally funded projects and going to the supreme court to cut back on the rights of citizens to challenge such practices
5847386 who will send a letter which guarantees that virus samples sent by indonesia will only be used for reassesment diagnostic and not for commercial purposes
5847387 once we get the letter we can start sending our bird flu samples until the right mechanism is put in place
5847388 what we need to do and want to do is develop mechanisms that will permit countries to have access to vaccines if they need it
5847389 i want to be treated in a third rate hospital in a third world nation and have a 80 chance of not making it
5847390 several months ago i postured that a nuclear option to stop a spread of bird flu would be to use neutron weapons against the disease but not so much as the indon people regretable but perhaps necessary at that time it had not spread so flagrantly revere said that it wouldnt work anyway and i agreed it wouldnt stop it but it would slow it to a crawl
5847391 you would use it to produce vaccine for your people and we would have none
5847392 if the indonesian elite cares so little about their own people how would they care about some abstract people of the outside world

5847409 young people are the target of more advertising media and marketing than any generation before and their mindset is both incredibly savvy and unusually jaded
5847410 young people do not want to be defined by a normal lifestyle they favor a unique and personal journey
5847411 relationships are the driving force being loyal to friends is one of their highest values they have a strong need to belong usually to a tribe of other loyal people who know them well and appreciate them
5847412 young people engage in a nearly constant search for fresh experiences and new sources of motivation they want to try things out themselves disdaining self proclaimed experts and talking head presentations if something doesnt work for them or if they are not permitted to participate in the process they quickly move on to something that grabs them they prefer casual and comfortable to stuffy and stilted they view life in a nonlinear chaotic way which means they dont mind contradiction and ambiguity they may tell someone what that person wants to hear but then do whatever they desire

5847447 how could one man rout a thousand or two men put ten thousand to flight unless it was because their rock sold them and the lord delivered them up
5847448 amen i say to you it will be hard for one who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven again i say to you it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for one who is rich to enter the kingdom of god
5847449 for men this is impossible but for god all things are possible
5847450 we have given up everything and followed you what will there be for us
5847451 amen i say to you that you who have followed me in the new age when the son of man is seated on his throne of glory will yourselves sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel and everyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times more and will inherit eternal life but many who are first will be last and the last will be first
5847452 so much emphasis certainly in movies and pop culture is placed on falling in love and getting married but then everyone kind of shuts up and doesnt really look at what happens during married life and how married love is very different from the premarital love that got you to the altar we could learn a lot about what is in the nature of marriage and separate that from what our personal problems might be we could probably have fewer divorces if people realized that some of the problems have to do with the nature of married life its the only relationship that is both domestic and sexual its very hard when youre living day in and day out with one person
5847453 i have talked to tracy yao rafer and also stayed in contact in coach adelman even when he was out of coaching yao is the missing piece in the playoffs he has to stay healthy and ill do whatever yao says i spent time with mutombo in the bahamas and he gave me great advice on how to lengthen my career by taking care of my knees

5847467 yeah i dont think so we might have to do this another day
5847468 maybe friday morning if you can put him in the bathroom in a cat carrier i can them work with him and if i need to sedate him
5847469 how about i try to catch him now and you can sedate him
5847470 itll take five to ten minutes we should leave him in here so he doesnt crawl into someplace we cant get him out of
5847471 young people dont find department stores cool every time theres an obituary the department stores lose a customer
5847472 afraid so still ive seen worse the surgeons should be able to fix you up weve got you in some splints now to keep the bones from moving around but once we get you to an or theyll put on a few plates some screws bad news is youll never be able to clear airport security again
5847473 oh my this is quite out of the ordinary im afraid
5847474 this is out of the ordinary i havent even called our insurance agent yet you guys certainly give prompt service
5847475 actually the hospital called i was in the building for another client and uh thought id take care of this right away but i see youre uh still uh awake
5847476 well i didnt hit my head that hard and despite the pain medication my legs are throbbing just enough to remind me what happened
5847477 i regret to inform you that based on the situation and damage incurred we are determining your case to be a total loss im very sorry
5847478 i pretty much figured that after seeing the damage myself but even the police office agreed it was the other womans fault
5847479 well i dont deal with fault mr carter just the numbers you see
5847480 i dont think ill be driving for quite some time so it might be better to settle up after ive had some time to recover i know it was an older car but it must be worth something
5847481 yes my geo you said it was a total loss i assume i might still get a thousand or so out of it it was in pretty good shape despite the mileage
5847482 oh no mr carter you have this all wrong im from chicago casualty i represent your major medical carrier im the adjustor that has been assigned to assess your injuries and make recommendations regarding your care
5847483 you did say that my case was a total loss
5847484 yes im afraid so ive been over the estimates three times im afraid i cant justify the needed surgery and rehabilitation based on your life expectancy and the current value of your body parts
5847485 we will cover five days of minimal hospitalization with adequate pain medication to keep you comfortable but after that time im afraid we must insist that you well stop receiving medical care and we be allowed to salvage the body for any useful parts to recoup our expenditures to this point
5847486 all they did was put in an iv and wrap my legs with these splints this must be a joke is there a hidden camera around here
5847487 no no camera but the expenses so far have been considerable mr carter
5847488 lets see 5 435 for emergency field treatment at the scene of the accident
5847489 talk about high liability insurance those guys are covered to the gills
5847490 675 for transportation to the emergency room 3 125 for diagnostic ct scans and radiographs 8 432 for blood work iv medications consults and emergency care oh and 422 for the splints each that is not including your five days minimal hospitalization youre already at 18 511 we estimate your daily hospital bill to be around 3 300 that will be a total expenditure by our company of 35 011 so you see mr carter chicago casualty has been quite generous in providing you with quality emergency treatment and care up to this point
5847491 well thats not exactly what the policy says mr carter did you read the policy
5847492 we are only required to provide complete care in the event that recovery is imminent and full and the technology exists and is in common use in other word we cant do a head transplant until they become a codable procedure on the reimbursement form
5847493 but the doctor said they would be able to repair my legs
5847494 furthermore mr carter if a patient shows no signs of recovering such as in a persistent vegetative state or requiring heroic measures to sustain life we may elect to discontinue medical care
5847495 im still here brain is fine no machines keeping me alive
5847496 if at any time the cost to sustain a patients condition or to repair damage exceeds the patients intrinsic value or treatment would not result in recovery of the patient to a value exceeding the costs the insurer may decline paying further medical costs and attempt to recover costs as obtainable from the removal and distribution of body parts from the corpse
5847497 for the purposes of your health insurance policy mr carter you may as well be
5847498 we wouldnt kill you in fact it is better if the parts are harvested while the heart is still beating for the major organs eyes and bones and cartilage and skin keep for quite some time
5847499 you cant get a doctor to do this its crazy
5847500 we have our own surgical technicians that do the harvesting
5847501 not if you are a total loss i admit the wording of the policy is not specific to your situation but the way i interpret it we have a fiduciary responsibility to our shareholders and policyholders to cut our losses in your case and obtain as much salvage value as possible
5847502 now considering your age and previous medical conditions we can estimate values for certain organs and parts
5847503 oh we dont sell them per se there is an allowable harvest storage distribution and transportation fee that our subsidiary which does all that stuff is allowed to charge the organs are of course free to whoever needs them but we are entitled to some reimbursement for our trouble
5847504 heart and lungs come in at 2 568 your previous history of smoking greatly reduces the value there
5847505 youre going to deny me medical care for 11 875 thats insane ill just put the balance on my credit card heck a new car will cost me twice that
5847506 thats not the way it works mr carter if we did approve repairs were looking at almost two hundred thousand dollars in additional charges over the next year im afraid we couldnt take the financial risk of continued insurance considering potential complications and your history of needing medical care
5847507 but this is the first time ive ever had to be in the hospital
5847508 exactly mr carter youve been with us for less than three months at this point without surgery and rehabilitation youre costing us an extrapolated yearly cost of 140 044 on a premium of 3 567 numbers dont lie mr carter ill see you in five days
5847509 i told david not to switch he thought it would save the company a few thousand bucks dont worry well get it straightened out
5847510 you are a mess look at you two broken legs cuts and bruises that car was a death trap an accident waiting to happen
5847511 no not a mess a loss theyre writing me off im too expensive
5847512 no it was the guy from the health insurance im a total loss it would cost more to fix me than im worth so they want to pull the plug and sell off my parts
5847513 very funny gary had me going for a second those pain medications arent helping your sense of humor
5847514 well pay whatever the insurance doesnt cover how much could it be
5847515 im dr wilson i saw your chart at the station and since im the orthopedist on call i thought id check in sorry i wasnt here sooner no one paged me we had an emergency
5847516 both legs eh still the radiologist report is hopeful we should be able to get you back up in six months or so
5847517 i thought the insurance had determined me a total loss
5847518 thats ridiculous youre not even in a coma let me check your insurance page
5847519 well on rare occasions peoples insurance coverage runs out or the doctors and insurance company agree that further treatment is pointless but your husband here isnt in that position it must be a mistake
5847520 thats what i thought but the insurance guy went over the numbers he seemed so analytical
5847521 cant you just go ahead and fix him doesnt the hospital have the ability to help people without insurance
5847522 well if you had no insurance at all yes wed be obligated to provide care and repair the fractures but you do have insurance and the insurance company has the option to cut their losses
5847523 cant we just cancel the insurance its not like we couldnt pay for it ourselves over time
5847524 when it comes to financial matters the hospital administrators dont like to get into battles with insurance
5847525 so theyre just going to cut me up for parts
5847526 once they stop paying for care in five days youre not going to feel much like living especially as the bones start to heal back together in abnormal positions heck you might get lucky and have a bone marrow embolism and it will be over like that
5847527 if there was a way to do this i would
5847528 but my hands are tied if i touch your husband i will not only be fired but every insurance company in the countryd blacklist me worse yet i cant even bill for this consultation
5847529 all these insurance policies have loopholes and exceptions and twisted procedures and rules maybe there is a way to beat them at their own game
5847530 here is the insurance page you look this over im going home to get our copy of the policy well figure out something
5847531 you think we can beat this insurance company at their own game maybe we need to call the police or insurance board or something
5847532 if we cant find anything well have to but maybe we can find something that will make them reclassify you from a total loss
5847533 as i explained to you before mr carter i cant get involved
5847534 they have no choice when you put it like that they worded their policy too well it seems
5847535 i should be able to book an or for this afternoon
5847536 oh and dr wilson be sure to use the very best stuff
5847537 only the top of the line for you mr carter
5847538 theyll take the edge off for the anesthesia they shouldnt knock you out but youll get a good buzz
5847539 mr carter um im afraid theres been some sort of misunderstanding
5847540 ive actually been expecting you i didnt think it would take long you guys probably saw something pop up on my hospital bill and realized what was happening
5847541 well yes the lorazepam tablets are typically given to preoperative patients of whom you are not
5847542 oh but mr crawford i am a preoperative patient in an hour i will be an operative patient and later tonight i will be a post operative patient chicago casualty will be sparing no expense at fixing me up titanium alloy bone plates and screws top quality inpatient and outpatient physical therapy the best pain medications even a private room with cable and all the nfl games during my recovery whats even better is that youll owe me twelve thousand nine hundred dollars at the end of the day what a deal
5847543 we dont even do that for patients who qualify for coverage why would we do it for a total loss
5847544 ah mr carter i see youre nice and relaxed for surgery
5847545 i represent his insurance company and we have denied his claim this patient is a total loss
5847546 everything seems to be in order with regard to that
5847547 here it is approved my a mr bernard crawford thats you i believe
5847548 of course it is now cancel this mans surgery or i will be forced to call the hospital administrator and possibly deny any payment on this patients bill
5847549 you can call the administrator his extension is 1874 but im afraid hes signed off on this
5847550 mr carter you are entitled to four more days of care then thats it we are entitled to any and all salvageable body parts for distribution at our discretion now i dont know what you think you are pulling but this must stop now as it is im going to have a tough time with the lorazepam tablets going through since they werent pre authorized the hospital may have to swallow those so to speak
5847551 mr crawford you really must read the policy more carefully im sure you have it memorized paragraph by paragraph but perhaps youre too close to see certain subtleties for once the insurance company is going to get screwed and the best part is you did it to yourselves
5847552 its your total loss provision cleverly buried in a section on exclusions for special diets not related to metabolic or hormonal disorders prescribed by a clinical nutritionist under fda livestock feeding guidelines you guys must get a laugh when you write these things
5847553 im not disputing the total loss thats where your problem is
5847554 yes the policy expects everyone to dispute the total loss who wouldnt after all we are talking about someone dying granted most people covered under this provision are going to die anyway but you never took into account specifically a patient who was still conscious
5847555 i bet you guys thought it was pretty compassionate to include the five day waiting period pay out a little for a few days then reap a windfall with body harvesting in fact your little subsidiary that harvests parts and distributes them for what are undeniably reasonable fees doesnt even get notified until the day before harvest why should they they have other things to do
5847556 so they harvest you early i dont care if you give up the four days
5847557 oh you should you see since i wont be using my body for those four days im entitled to compensation equal to but no greater than the daily expenses for unused days that is over and above my deductible of three hundred dollars
5847558 no one has ever waived their time even people with dying relatives never waive the five days its crazy
5847559 its in the policy and you yourself quoted me the cost of three thousand three hundred dollars a day at four days left minus three hundred
5847560 and im entitled to that check by the end of business today
5847561 yes but even so we dont have to pay for your injuries
5847562 then why are you having surgery to fix your broken legs
5847563 and repair my lacerations they say the plastic surgeon guy here is excellent
5847564 mr crawford again you are too close to the policy step back a moment i am not your patient now i am your property well was your property until you sold the distribution rights to my parts
5847565 nothing in the policy says i cant in fact the policy assumes that all tissues for distribution will go to you preferred distributor but by law you have to include language delineating an open bidding process of course without having to actually notify anyone its up to the other parties to sniff out available bodies before the bidding closes
5847566 assuming you did waive the five days and properly bid on the distribution rights i still dont see how we have to pay for your surgeries and recovery it will cost us a fortune it just isnt included in any coverage
5847567 again mr crawford youre thinking like a weasel trying to steal an egg from under a chicken youre not paying under the policy in fact the policy specifically forbids any further treatment once the five days are waived
5847568 under the organ donation section it specifically states that chicago casualty will do all that it can to insure the organs provided are suitable for use and free from defects or damage prior to distribution since my bones and skin are included in the list you provided for me the other day you have to make sure they are in good condition before i can take possession as i read the policy that means the bones must be fixed and the skin repaired
5847569 its not the intention of the policy to have otherwise healthy people harvested for organs when they can be fixed you are the one who is trying to stretch the wording to save your company some money now you are stuck with the whole bill and you owe me almost thirteen thousand dollars
5847570 the hospital billing department has copies of all the appropriate policy sections my waiver and bid for distribution rights oh and since this is not a patient coverage theyre going to want to be paid right away instead of waiting four to six months like you usually make them do
5847571 carter three oh seven got a date in or six
5847572 ill get the total loss waived well pay for the standard coverage
5847573 naw ill go with what ive got now sorry mr crawford
5847574 a long time ago in a galaxy far far away
5847575 reba is one of the best editors i have worked with her work is thorough reliable and efficient she is always a pleasure to work with i would recommend her to even the pickiest of authors
5847576 reba hilbert is a consummate professional editor who provided an invaluable service to me in preparing my manuscript for publication we all know the old saying that a lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client well the writer is equally foolish for not calling upon an excellent editor like reba i work as an editor for academic journals and teach editing but i wouldnt think of publishing without the assistance of rebas keen editorial perspective

5847601 despite the progress achieved in agriculture and rural development more than 850 million people still remain hungry and poor our greatest challenge is to reach the world food summit and first un millennium development goal to halve by 2015 hunger and poverty worldwide
5847602 the challenge of increasing investment in agriculture is especially great in africa governments in that region have recognized the urgency of committing their own resources to agriculture in the maputo declaration of 2003 african heads of state committed their governments to allocate 10 per cent of their national budget to agriculture and rural development within five years thus doubling the present level of resources to agriculture
5847603 that is where it is critical to provide food and employment the seed planted by a farmer leads to a flourishing agribusinesses that paid taxes and helped build rural schools and roads agricultural development is the first step of a long term sustainable economic growth everyone gains from investment in agriculture
5847604 the right to adequate food is indivisibly linked to inherent dignity of the human person and is indispensable for the fulfilment of other human rights
5847605 we consider it intolerable that more than 800 million people throughout the world and particularly in developing countries do not have enough food to meet their nutritional needs
5847606 i think the ethics committee is going to review this matter
5847607 theres been a lot of favorable talk about larry in the cloakroom
5847608 and i think the initial shock has worn off and seeing him back in good spirits hes been a colleague for a long time 17 years you dont toss over a friend of that duration and intensity easily
5847609 i dont think its one of those situations where people dislike larry

5847613 it is regrettable that america has not gotten over the o j simpson criminal case
5847614 the fact that he is being held without bail seems unfair and over the top
5847615 o j has always been able to satisfy his obligations to the court he cooperated with the authorities in this case he is not a flight risk and he certainly cant hide anywhere
5847616 by our standard there was no major show of force
5847617 certainly he has abused that courtesy so i would not expect anyone to extend it to him again

5847620 but these were things that belonged to him a long time ago
5847621 were going to presume that the bulk of the stuff is probably in police custody
5847622 assuming that this case is resolved one way or another at the end of the case the stuff will never go back to mr simpson
5847623 hes going to walk out of clark county empty handed
5847624 this is the kind of case that will test how fair and professional our legal system is when you have such a groundswell of dislike for someone you have to make sure they are treated like anyone else

5847683 its a mind blowing concept that the god who created the universe might be looking for company a real relationship with people but the thing that keeps me on my knees is the difference between grace and karma
5847684 you see at the center of all religions is the idea of karma you know what you put out comes back to you an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth or in physics in physical laws every action is met by an equal or an opposite one its clear to me that karma is at the very heart of the universe im absolutely sure of it and yet along comes this idea called grace to upend all that as you reap so will you sow stuff grace defies reason and logic love interrupts if you like the consequences of your actions which in my case is very good news indeed because ive done a lot of stupid stuff id be in big trouble if karma was going to finally be my judge id be in deep shit it doesnt excuse my mistakes but im holding out for grace im holding out that jesus took my sins onto the cross because i know who i am and i hope i dont have to depend on my own religiosity
5847685 i knew that i was on the outside of something i just didnt know what it was until now

5847736 weve been surrounded and battered by troubles but were not demoralized were not sure what to do but we know that god knows what to do weve been spiritually terrorized but god hasnt left our side weve been thrown down but we havent broken what they did to jesus they do to us trial and torture mockery and murder what jesus did among them he does in us he lives

5847744 im categorically opposed to the death penalty its an archaic form of punishment fraught with problems which reduces those perpetrating it to the level of the offenders who themselves are often at the margins of society and subject to a poor or inconsistent level of justice

5847748 the most reliable source of foreign money going to poor countries
5847749 principal sources of foreign capital for small family businesses throughout the developing world
5847750 migration could do more to boost the economic prospects of many developing countries than either overseas aid or foreign investment
5847751 development often first enhances and thereafter reduces the scope and incentives for migration
5847752 the most direct development effect of migration is its direct impact on income and poverty levels in the source countries by allowing workers to move to areas where they are more productive migration leads to a direct increase in global output and income
5847753 while questions abound no one doubts that individual remittance payments which carry little or no overhead efficiently meet basic human needs in developing countries
5847754 beauty of remittances is that unlike overseas aid they end up directly in the pockets of people they are designed to help
5847755 only 31 of the households earned their money entirely in the dominican republic
5847756 if you believe that the world is an unequal place and that the rich should do more to help the poor then freer international migration should be the next front in the battle for global economic justice
5847757 by exacerbating and solving the problem of limited employment migration again makes transnational community a necessary part of everyday life it shrinks the number of jobs available by diminishing farmings prestige and reclassifying it as an occupation of disrepute
5847758 migrant remittances can undoubtedly play a role in many ssa countries but at present these remittance flows are largely directed to meeting the consumption needs of family members left behind rather than channeled towards directly productive investment activities
5847759 if poor people prefer to spend their money on televisions then its up to them
5847760 migration offers the solution to the very problem it creates dominicans go to the united states to do the work that americans wont do anymore they do what is too denigrating to americans but now for the banilejo it is too denigrating to work in the fields
5847761 thirty percent of filipino children live in households where at least one parent has gone overseas
5847762 compared to their classmates the children of migrant workers more frequently fell ill they were more likely to express anger confusion and apathy and they performed particularly poorly in school

5847868 mortgage debt is viewed as much riskier now than it was a couple of years ago during the housing boom
5847869 probably about a year ago that would have been fine
5847870 the tightening of the guidelines by fannie mae and freddie mac as a result of the mortgage collapse have had a rippling effect with all lenders and all loan types
5847871 its very difficult to imagine a scenario in which the federal government doesnt step in
5847872 we have 12 players ready to step on the court
5847873 it sounds corny but youre only as strong as your weakest link
5847874 we learned a lot from that loss were not going to take anything for granted
5847875 when you wear that usa jersey a lot is expected
5847876 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
5847877 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5847878 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5847879 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5847880 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5847881 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5847882 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5847883 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5847884 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5847885 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5847886 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5847887 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5847888 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
5847889 were creating an ambiance a point of relaxation a meeting place
5847890 they started in los angeles and flourished there for a reason
5847891 because l a is all about image and hype and being seen being seen doing things that are cool people see a photo of paris eating pinkberry and they want it
5847892 then jet took him down and said wake up wake up wake up
5847893 i do not mean to personally impugn them as they might be good people in the flesh but the medias images of them are smelly and vile and i must always attack the medias representation of what is good or cool
5847894 those who inhabit the media world of glamour and entertainment and fashion and gossip are horrid people who have no talent of any kind and yet think of themselves as tastemakers
5847895 miss jolie says she likes mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh
5847896 arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5847897 one great thing about hockey is that youre able to display aggressive behavior in an acceptable manner you dont have to go to prison or whatnot for striking someone with an elbow it makes a good setting to look at aggression
5847898 we were astounded to see that this relatively simple measurement in the face predicted how aggressive men were in a lab based computer game and then equally astounded to see that the same measure could predict aggressive behavior in a real world setting that of sports
5847899 competitors may have used this cue likely on a subconscious level to decide whether or not to take an opponent on
5847900 for example if people were asked to rate how aggressive men were was on the basis of photographs would their ratings be accurate
5847901 these are the types of follow up research questions that we are now investigating
5847902 surprisingly i have found that their behavior is opposite to these expectations something that could be attributed to a self defeating prophecy effect whereby babyfaced men overcompensate for social expectations that are unpleasant for young men
5847903 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice
5847904 hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
5847905 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5847906 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that
5847907 he slept on his arm the other night and he came in and felt some tingling in his fingertips
5847908 as far as pain goes its not that much pain at all with it its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered until now
5847909 im very frustrated but theres not much for me to do
5847910 i want to play i want to compete theres only so much time in a career and i want to get out there and help my teammates were in a great situation right now were leading our division and weve got a great chance to go to the playoffs and you want to be a part of that
5847911 its a dangerous area it is in the elbow it is in the tendon
5847912 we didnt expect to have more swelling today you expected to have less swelling and the fact that you have more swelling thats a concern and thats why if it goes that route we have to be more careful and be more conservative
5847913 well just try to match up the best way we can
5847914 the thing i want to be careful of at this stage of the season is anointing someone as that person and then that doesnt work out
5847915 i do not necessarily determine the role the relief pitcher determines the role
5847916 im considering everybody from the gulf coast league to triple a can any of yall throw
5847917 the reality is true proven guys are not going to get through
5847918 i feel comfortable that the answer when billys not here is in that room
5847919 the guys in there are going to have to step up i think weve got the guys
5847920 were not the only team that goes through this and we have to find a way to get it done
5847921 the number of penalties will decrease and the quality of care will dramatically improve as hospitals take action to improve
5847922 the entire intent of these fines is to improve the overall quality of care in california
5847923 i am the pro of the hospital the other nurses call me to put in ivs that they cannot get in
5847924 the chat rooms let me know what to look up where to go
5847925 in real life traders typically congregate and become better traders by sharing knowledge if you put them online theyll chat as well
5847926 the mbta ultimately is trying to silence some uncomfortable truths that these students uncovered
5847927 they brought an action against three college kids rather than address the problems in their own house
5847928 its a lot like the shock absorbers on your car
5847929 it isolates the vibrations just traveling through the structure all the way up to the seat
5847930 what we want to make sure of is that we dont get into a situation that would leave aftereffects with the crew
5847931 theres nothing on our risk list that is what i would call a showstopper or a major issue that we cant deal with

5847981 if you are going to raise kids for true greatness it most likely will cost them some ridicule thats because true greatness often runs against the grain of popularity convenience and conventional wisdom its risky too grooming kids for true greatness means they might have to make their lives vulnerable to people and situations that play fast and loose with their hearts obviously god has called us to a level of shrewdness when raising our kids we need to make sure that were monitoring what they are facing and helping them process it through the proper spiritual filters im not advocating that you recklessly throw your kids to the mercy of a hostile world but thats why god invented righteous godly parenting we can create those filters in the safe harbor of our home thereby empowering our kids to live on the front lines of their peer group and make a difference god has not called us to raise safe kids hes called us to raise spiritually potent ones

5847989 through lease option families are moving up the ladder into upscale homes in the atlanta area
5847990 our inventory of luxury homes available for lease option in metro atlanta is becoming quite extensive slower upscale home sales are creating openings for lease options and families are taking advantage of these opportunities
5847991 selling homes on lease purchase terms has become an invaluable tool to atlanta homebuilders and is being utilized daily in marketing properties that were just sitting and costing builders untold thousands of dollars per month
5847992 to sell a home in atlantas current buyers market requires creative thinking on behalf of the seller the popularity of lease purchase options reflects that kind of thinking

5848042 het is bar en boos het is soms zo erg dat ik er s ochtends wakker van word als ik mijn ramen open heb
5848043 veelal overdag maar het verschuift steeds meer naar de avond en nacht er zit niet echt een patroon in
5848044 maar als het dan net eventjes iets minder is zeggen ze tsja ik vind het eigenlijk wel meevallen je krijgt het gevoel dat je niet serieus genomen wordt
5848045 terwijl dat eigenlijk niet zou mogen want het is een afgesloten systeem
5848046 die zakken gaan naar een gecertificeerd geurlab daar bepalen geurpanels de mate van stank
5848047 er is disproportie tussen het aantal klachten en de uitkomst van de metingen op basis van de uitkomsten zouden er veel minder klachten moeten zijn
5848048 wel de dag ervoor en de dag erna er waren sowieso weinig klachten in juli in augustus begon het pas echt
5848049 we gaan verder op zoek naar de bron van de overlast gedeputeerde moons neemt dit soort klachten uitermate serieus het bureau metingen heeft opdracht om de zaak verder uit te zoeken
5848050 er wordt gezocht naar een relatie tussen het weer en de klachten de bedoeling daarvan is dat we gerichter kunnen gaan zoeken naar de oorzaak we gaan meten op het moment dat de kans op geurhinder het grootst is
5848051 we kunnen eerst de omvang en ernst van het probleem in kaart brengen maar we kunnen die stap ook overslaan en ons meteen richten op het bedrijfsproces van kws dus het treffen van praktische maatregelen het hangt er van af hoeveel geduld er nog is want onderzoek kost veel tijd

5848104 if the light in you is darkness how great is that darkness
5848105 the only true god is the head of the messiah the messiah is the head of the man and the man is the head of the woman
5848106 the words that i speak are not my words but the words of the father who sent me
5848107 the works i do are not my works but my father does the works
5848108 truly i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the father do for what the father does the son does likewise
5848109 why do you call me master lord master lord and do not do that which i say
5848110 exercised their senses after drinking of the testimonies in the discernment of that which is good and that which is evil
5848111 then said the messiah unto him a certain man made a great supper and invited many and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were invited come for all things are now ready and they all began to make excuse the first said unto him i have bought a piece of ground and i must needs go and see it i pray you have me excused and another said i have bought five yoke of oxen and i must go to prove them i pray you have me excused and another said i have married a wife and therefore i cannot come so that servant came and told his lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring here the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind and the servant said lord it is done as you have commanded and yet there is room and the lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for i say unto you that none of those men which were invited shall taste of my supper
5848112 and there went great multitudes with the messiah and he turned and said unto them if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yes and his own life also he cannot be my disciple and whoever does not bear his cross and follow after me cannot be my disciple
5848113 the one god father of all will supply all their needs
5848114 you can not serve the only true god and money
5848115 love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father he who is in heaven
5848116 the words you hear are not my words but they are the words of the father creator who sent me
5848117 you have heard that it has been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but i say unto you that you resist not evil but whoever smites you on your right cheek turn to him the other also
5848118 whoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven
5848119 why do you call me master lord master lord and do not the things which i say
5848120 not every one that says unto me master master shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that does the will of my father who is in heaven many will say to me in that day master master have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me you that work iniquity therefore whoever hears these sayings of mine and does them i will liken him unto a wise man who built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and every one that hears these sayings of mine and does them not shall be likened unto a foolish man who built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it
5848121 recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men if it is possible as much as lies in you live peaceably with all men dearly beloved avenge not your selves but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay says the lord therefore if your enemy hungers feed him if he is thirsty give him drink for in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good
5848122 see that none renders evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men
5848123 not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but contrariwise blessing knowing that you were called to do so that you should inherit a blessing for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile let him eschew evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers but the face of the lord is against them that do evil and who is he that will harm you if you are followers of that which is good but and if you suffer for righteousness sake happy are you and be not afraid of their terror neither be troubled but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you for the reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in the messiah
5848124 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places
5848125 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strong holds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of the messiah
5848126 you therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of the messiah no man that wars entangles himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier
5848127 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god
5848128 blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you
5848129 confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god
5848130 these things i have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world
5848131 for unto you it is given in the behalf of the messiah not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake having the same conflict which you saw in me and now hear to be in me
5848132 forasmuch then as the messiah has suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of god
5848133 for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction and many there are who enter that gate because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leads unto life and few there be that find it
5848134 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you are like whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness even so you also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites you build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous
5848135 but i say unto you who hear love your enemies luke 6 27a
5848136 whoever hears these sayings of mine and does them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock
5848137 and why do you call me master master and do not the things which i say
5848138 for whoever shall do the will of my father who is in heaven the same is my brother and sister and mother
5848139 whoever lives and believes in me my testimony and my example of the life shall never die

5848167 and now o father glorify me with your own self with the glory that i had with you before the world began
5848168 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was not is god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not any thing made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shined in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he john the baptist was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light the messia he was the true light which enlightens every man that comes into the world he the messiah was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of the only true god
5848169 for our father sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believes on him is not condemned but he that believes not is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of our father and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for every one that does evil hates the light neither comes to the light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that does truth comes to the light the messiah that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in our father
5848170 the messiah answered yet a little while is the light with you walk while you have the light lest darkness come upon you for he that walks in darkness does not know where he goes while you have light believe in the light that you may be the children of light the messiah spoke these things and departed and hid himself from them
5848171 the light which enlightens every man born into the world
5848172 the whole world is under the control of the evil one

5848207 listen to the commandments of the lord your god which i charge you today to observe them carefully and do not turn aside from any of the words which i command you today to the right or to the left to go after other gods to serve them
5848208 but it shall come about if you do not obey the lord your god to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes with which i charge you today that all these curses will come upon you and overtake you
5848209 so all these curses shall come on you and pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed
5848210 if you are not careful to observe all the words of this law which are written in this book to fear this honored and awesome name the lord your god
5848211 so all these curses shall come on you and pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed

5848230 the same could be said of laura nyro and judee sill the language they use doesnt have the rage of alanis or liz phair or pj harvey but theres still some of that matching of rage to articulacy and thats unusual in pop
5848231 you could not play that on the radio now its incredibly filthy so its not as if it hadnt been expressed before liz phair

5848292 cualquier f rmula que garantice la viabilidad del parque puede ser buena y adecuada y hay que buscar no s lo mantener esa industria tur stica sino sus beneficios sobre el entorno inmediato

5848306 nuestro peor enemigo es el hombre del tiempo incluso cuando se equivoca las familias planifican con mucho tiempo su visita al parque as que si les dicen que va a llover el pr ximo fin de semana ya no vienen aunque luego salga un d a luminoso
5848307 estos resultados avalan nuestra decisi n de desestacionalizar el negocio y convertirnos en un destino de ocio familiar atractivo durante todo el a o

5848355 the alliance needs to make sure that when it takes on pledges of collective defense it is prepared to stand by them

5848459 uncontrolled diabetes wreaks havoc on the body often leading to kidney failure blindness and death a new study shows that the nations unchecked diabetes epidemic exacts a heavy financial toll as well 174 billion a year thats about as much as the conflicts in iraq afghanistan and the global war on terrorism combined its more than the 150 billion in damage caused by hurricane katrina the incidence of diabetes has ballooned there are 1 million new cases a year as more americans become overweight or obese according to the study released wednesday by the american diabetes association the cost of diabetes both in direct medical care and lost productivity has swelled 32 since 2002 the report shows diabetes killed more than 284 000 americans last year according to the diabetes association
5848460 previous studies from our lab have demonstrated many connections between chronic partial sleep deprivation changes in appetite metabolic abnormalities obesity and diabetes risk

5848464 therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation the old has gone the new has come
5848465 next year the banks may face higher credit costs and that may lower earnings growth
5848466 the positive earnings revision cycle over the past 12 months looks to be ending as nims are reaching a plateau and credit risks are rising as chinas economy faces potentially greater than expected slowdown risks
5848467 the odd bit of profit taking maybe but i think the stakes theyve got are quite unique and they wouldnt be in a rush to sell unless they were really financially stretched
5848468 what is the normalized pre bubble savings rate you dont have to dial back to the jurassic period just the late 80s or 90s
5848469 before we became addicted to asset bubbles the savings rate was roughly 8 percent
5848470 weve never been in a recession with the interest ratio where the household side is today
5848471 you are talking about the need to eliminate 350 billion of debt service about 2 trillion of household debt has to be totally eradicated
5848472 lets not use the word cure if you dont mind when you talk about cure you imply that were broken i dont feel broken
5848473 oh great maybe hell say something about the problems faced by women with asds
5848474 at that point the georgian leadership told some of us we have no choice but to defend our villages and our people and lift the cease fire our message remained the same that we understand the predicament you face
5848475 but we strongly recommend that you not engage in a direct military conflict with russia because that is unwinnable
5848476 were not trying to issue vague empty threats or wag our finger but simply stating the fact that this military operation has imposed a serious cost on russia in terms of its standing in the world
5848477 thats not as good thing its not something that we relish its not something that we want to see happen
5848478 the target regime for local authorities must be changed so instead of a focus only on individuals waste priority is given to ensuring businesses are doing their bit to reduce waste an important step would be to introduce true individual producer responsibility for waste associated with a companys products so manufacturers who behave irresponsibly face financial consequences and those who are doing the right thing are supported
5848479 there is excessive packaging on a number of items chocolate biscuits easter eggs and so on and people should be alerted to the fact that this is not an efficient way for businesses to operate wasteful packaging was something we thought needs to be addressed
5848480 early sell by dates enables supermarkets to turn round their stock more quickly and they are obviously loathed to expose themselves to legal action if there is something wrong with their food
5848481 therefore perfectly good food may be thrown away because of a mixture of supermarkets being overly cautious and being keen to move stock along
5848482 this independent report highlights the failings of the government to tackle the vast amount of waste produced by businesses and the lamentable record of this government in helping firms increase their recycling labour ministers seem obsessed with hammering householders with heavy handed bin taxes bin fines and bin cuts despite the fact that domestic rubbish is a small fraction of the total amount that we throw away
5848483 such a change could lead to manufacturers adapting their business model to encourage more sustainable consumption amongst their customers
5848484 the committee looked at the growth of fast fashion and point out that the increased use of cheap fabrics for clothes intended to be worn for a short period of time and then thrown away makes recycling of fabric more difficult and is reflective of an increasing throwaway society
5848485 businesses need to match the efforts local people have made in recent years to reduce this countrys reliance on landfill it is unfair for them to profit at the taxpayers expense as councils are left to deal with the rubbish they create
5848486 reducing packaging is vital if we are to avoid paying more landfill tax and eu fines which could lead to cuts in frontline services and increases in council tax the days of the cling film coconut must come to an end we all have a responsibility to reduce the amount of waste being thrown into landfill which is damaging the environment and contributing to climate change
5848487 the landfill tax escalator specifically targets business and commerce as high waste producers we have a big programme of engagement with business and have invested over 650m in the last three years
5848488 people across the country not just in london can see for themselves that after just three months the new tory administration in london is in complete disarray
5848489 the mayor of london has been frank in his opposition to his leaders claim which has always been the most cynical nonsense
5848490 in doing so he has signalled that at least one senior conservative is fed up of david cameron running britain down
5848491 if youre going to take very important political decisions about london transport its absolutely vital the mayor chairs tfl and tim parker agrees with me that thats the way forward
5848492 his exit after just a couple of months in fact confirms the chaos which has existed in boris johnsons administration since day one
5848493 there are heroes in this world but there are no supermen and the hero is not necessarily the person who wins the gold medal
5848494 headcount reduction will result from the integration of the back office functions with that of abbey
5848495 there remain significant external risks presented by the deterioration in the broader economic outlook and the continuing turbulence in financial markets
5848496 there is no way we could be liable for maintaining a pension fund for employees of someone else
5848497 he is on a yacht in the caribbean and i gather the reception is not very good
5848498 following constructive discussions with the rmt today we have been able to agree in principle a two year deal that will satisfy all parties
5848499 i dont want this any more i cannot do this
5848500 the most important thing is to get jade back and get her with the right people so they can take care of her
5848501 i have cancer it is bad needs urgent treatment i immediately need to go home
5848502 i know it sounds crazy but i have to pay my bills
5848503 and if i do face cancer i need to make sure i can support the boys
5848504 i pray she comes out of this soon and stronger
5848505 so sorry jade but youre strong enough to come through
5848506 fifa today confirmed that it has asked the georgian fa to nominate a neutral venue for the group 8 world cup qualifier match against the republic of ireland on september 6 fifa has indicated that it expects to confirm the new venue next week
5848507 everyone will understand why liu xiang had to abandon competition
5848508 we hope he will relax and focus on recovery we hope that after he recovers he will continue to train hard and struggle harder for the national glory
5848509 theres so many people concerned about me and who support me i feel very sorry
5848510 they only work four and a half days each week every day there are two coffee breaks there cannot be any discomfort because of human rights
5848511 you could not criticise them either they have all kind of institutions unions
5848512 had the highest level of political review since the founding of the peoples republic of china basically all reviews were from the central committee level
5848513 severe threat to the safety of planes coming out of the airport
5848514 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
5848515 whether it is automobile emissions reduction or construction site dust reduction or coal pollution reduction i believe that the requirements will be more stringent
5848516 i want to see anyone who poses a threat to our children dealt with as firmly as possible
5848517 ive spoken to child protection experts and the police and they have told me that these changes will further restrict the ability of child sex offenders to harm children both here and overseas
5848518 we are concerned that current travel prevention orders designed to prevent offenders from going overseas are not working hardly any have been issued against sex offenders in the past five years
5848519 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
5848520 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world i want gary glitter to be controlled while hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5848521 i had a pretty good suspicion that people who were well motivated would do well with the technique but you have to be committed to learning it for it to benefit you i suspected most folks might not be that committed and so we might not show terribly much
5848522 this is a good large trial it is good enough evidence for people to take it seriously
5848523 but at the moment the alexander technique is not available on the nhs
5848524 from now on they are not allowed to talk to any of the coaches they can give them time checks in the countdown to when they are ready to roll and thats it
5848525 well let them race there will be a handshake before they start and we will let them go there will be no camps no sides
5848526 that was the fairest way to do it because one of them could have said to me oh jasons riding this gear or something
5848527 it was very clear they wanted to be level and fair it was difficult because normally you have a chat about how are you going to beat this guy and we were on our own this time
5848528 it was exactly the same in one way you have a plan and a plan b but you get used to being told what this guy is going to do so about 10 minutes before the race it was like what i am going to do so you have to think about it and you think i have ridden a couple of these races in the past you just try to do the basic things right
5848529 from the outside it looks as if you are all calm and everything is great but theres always doubts you have you try to push them out and focus on the job you have to do i didnt think about three gold medals not even today i wasnt thinking about that i was thinking purely about the sprint itself the technical elements because if you break it down it takes care of itself
5848530 we knew it was a five day event not just two or three like a world cup ive trained hard on my recovery a lot of hard efforts with short recovery time its paid off psychologically you know you have it when you come to the tough bits
5848531 the olympics the gold medal thats the factor if it wasnt for the olympics probably after the kilometre was dropped id have thought thats it its the desire to rekindle that feeling of what it is to be olympic champion it wouldnt matter if it was in the team sprint or the keirin table tennis volleyball id do any sport for that
5848532 i knew i had to fight from behind in the race i may not be fast but i can fight
5848533 we do have trouble nowadays with the young vets who tend to see everything in black and white

5848551 over 700 million cartridges were thrown away world wide in 2003 and since more and more people use inkjet cartridges this amount will continue to grow year after year empty cartridges contain residual toner powder ink a plastic casing aluminum and other parts these parts are all non biodegradable and they will take more than 1000 years to decompose in landfill sites the remanufacturing of cartridges as an alternative to producing new ones currently reduces world demand of oil by 300 000 barrels and saves 17 000 tons of aluminum as well as 10 000 000 tons of timber besides helping to reduce carbon emissions a major cause of global warming it conserves resources and reduces waste 1 5 pints of crude oil are needed to produce one cartridge in the last 6 months alone inkjet cartridge recycling has saved more than 50 million liters of oil more than the exxon valdez oil spill in alaskas prince william sound in 1989
5848552 if america wants to solve its dependency on foreign oil sources or wants to deal with its environmental concerns we need to aggressively step up our involvement with nuclear power

5848562 technology is a tool to address some of the worlds most pressing challenges related to health care education economic development and the environment
5848563 no nations or individuals are untouched by these issues get involved be part of the solution
5848564 it was a thoughtful piece focusing on what technology can do rather than focusing on 45 nanometer technology
5848565 intel will have plenty of opportunity to talk about products and technology he was trying to raise the level over individual products
5848566 it was certainly crafted to hit some hot button issues
5848567 this is part of a larger recognition and effort by large it vendors that they need to do more to encourage innovation around the world
5848568 this was actually a very wise thing for them to do
5848569 what barrett was really talking about was that technology can no longer be innovative and cool but it needs to have a practical application like health care or energy consumption it has to make a difference in the way we live and work
5848570 at its peak ipv6 represented less than one hundredth of 1 percent of internet traffic
5848571 this is somewhat equivalent to the allowed parts of contaminants in drinking water
5848572 we believe this is the largest study of ipv6 and internet traffic in general to date by several orders of magnitude
5848573 though not a landslide of adoption it is still something
5848574 we create feature teams with n developers n testers and 1 2n program managers
5848575 on average a feature team is about 40 developers across the windows 7 project
5848576 some have said that the windows team is just too big and that it has reached a size that causes engineering problems at the same time i might point out that just looking at the comments there is a pretty significant demand for a broad set of features and changes to windows
5848577 it takes a set of people to build windows and it is a big project the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds cliche but what i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate
5848578 its not going to be a quick bounce back its going to be a slow steady state of recovery although were coming into a recession if you look at it from a historical context where weve seen some fairly harsh economic shocks our it spending our it development and our initiatives continue to move forward
5848579 you could be forgiven for looking at the economy the news and the commentary that were on the edge of a precipice about to fall off but were not it spending as a percentage of turnover and it spending as a percentage of budget are going up because it is fundamentally critical to the business
5848580 by the time we forward a 1 1mb e mail back it up synchronise it across multiple devices route it across the network one week later it is 51 5mb we are creating more stuff than we can keep
5848581 this is a good move for intel and its good for customers that intel is making the move
5848582 it will speed development of solid state drive ssd technology and drop the cost smaller pc manufacturers will be able to buy pre integrated ssd drives that will seamlessly slide right into current laptop and desktop designs which means no additional redesign or development cost
5848583 on the plus side they are faster smaller and can take less power they arent mechanical and are thus more reliable than regular hard drives
5848584 the downside is that currently they are more expensive over time the price of ssds will come down but i believe most users will eventually have systems that utilize both ssds and traditional hard drives a decent sized ssd will give a speed boost while the regular hard drive will store the bulk of the data

5848629 since many have set their hands to the task of drawing up an account of the events which were completed amongst us telling the story just as those who were the original eye witnesses and who became the servants of the word handed it down to us i too made up my mind to carry out a careful investigation of all things from the beginning and to write to you theophilus your excellency an orderly account of them so that you might have in your mind a full and reliable account of the things in which you have been instructed
5848630 so you love those that love you everybody does that
5848631 the way mr darling won her was this the many gentlemen who had been boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her and they all ran to her house to propose to her except mr darling who took a cab and nipped in first and so he got her he got all of her except the innermost box and the kiss he never knew about the box and in time he gave up trying for the kiss

5848667 as the mortgage meltdown forces more homes into foreclosure in the bay area some of these properties are being picked up by investors who are putting them back into the rental market
5848668 the upshot of this activity is that more single family houses are starting to show up as rentals in parts of the east bay such as antioch and in san joaquin county in addition some condo for sale properties in downtown oakland such as the broadway grand are being rented out as apartments because developers are having a hard time finding buyers in todays tough housing market
5848669 joy diricco a realtor in the antioch office of prudential california realty has 20 listings for various short sale properties in antioch and brentwood such sales help people who are having problems paying their mortgage avoid going into foreclosure

5848672 though mark schniepp executive director of the california economic forecast project in goleta does not believe prices will drop much more he predicts more year over year price declines for as long as foreclosures continue to rise
5848673 much of the declines were seeing right now is influenced heavily by distressed sales he said

5848675 julys median price for a southland home was 348 000 down 2 percent from 355 000 in june and down 31 1 percent from 505 000 for july 2007 broken out separately los angeles county home sales fell 3 2 percent in july compared with a year ago while prices dropped 26 9 percent

5848682 experts pointed to the record 40 8 percent of the sales involving homes foreclosed in the previous 12 months and the fact that new foreclosures are outnumbering the sales of foreclosed properties julys 1 259 foreclosure sales compared to junes 1 838 foreclosures
5848683 peter dennehy senior vp of sullivan group real estate advisors of san diego said the percentage of foreclosures and the mix of housing needs to be quite a bit smaller closer to the traditional level of 1 percent to 3 percent of sales
5848684 prices will stop falling he said when foreclosures stop increasing existing home sales are strong and the unsold inventory gets far below its current level of 19 058
5848685 while agents report overbidding on some foreclosure properties christopher thornberg a principal at beacon economics in los angeles said that interest is coming from vulture funds with millions of dollars to spend on distress sales

5848951 our members are taking this action very reluctantly they care deeply about the vital services they provide and those who depend on them and we apologise for any disruption
5848952 however members feel they have no choice when the employers offer is effectively a pay cut
5848953 the issues are difficult and complex and need to be carefully thought through
5848954 however as soon as possible we will arrange talks with the trade unions in a bid to reach a settlement which takes account of the soaring cost of living which affects councils just as much as our workers
5848955 i would encourage both parties to try to resolve the dispute to ensure that there is no further interruption to public services and i hope that resolution can be achieved by local authorities and their employees
5848956 to date most attention has been given to the plight of women trafficked into the sex trade but we have also found evidence of trafficking into scotland for domestic and agricultural labour
5848957 the case information we have been given also shows there are different methods of trafficking and different routes into scotland
5848958 we have come across an example of marriage being used as a mechanism of trafficking women into scotland for sexual exploitation and we have seen cases of trafficked persons being recovered at the port of stranraer
5848959 without acceptance of their status they cannot access appropriate services or help police with their inquiries
5848960 the fight against trafficking has been very much police led in the uk but we know that many victims of trafficking will never disclose their situation to a police officer because they fear shame deportation or reprisals from their traffickers
5848961 time it takes lenscrafters to make you a pair of bifocals
5848962 based on being seen in a bodybuilding video that he has somehow committed some fraud regarding his disability nothing could be further from the truth
5848963 this is a firefighter who has risked his life since 1986 for this city

5848974 a few weeks ago i was phoned by the relations of two constituents on a thursday evening who were literally frantic with worry
5848975 they had been advised it was unlikely fife council would be able to provide home care services over the forthcoming weekend to their relations
5848976 i am not sure whether the information just does not exist or whether the information is so damaging that there is a reluctance to put it in the public domain
5848977 i am appalled by the comments of some councillors who seem determined to question the professional integrity of fife council employees by suggesting they are hiding information from councillors
5848978 as an administration we are determined to be as open as possible about the councils performance
5848979 we all know how the internet revolution has connected otherwise strangers in virtual relationships the web is also giving new life to old junk by helping people give it away to those who need or want to reuse it for free

5848988 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5848989 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that

5848995 continued to gain significant momentum through the first half of 2008
5848996 when i was a kid i worked picking up range balls at holiday park golf course and the janitor for the summer was the late ken burkell he turned me on to a lot of the cool country music that was happening then such as flying burrito bros commander cody new riders of the purple sage and gram parsons that combined with my parents love of folk music was something that always stuck with me ive had a few twists and turns in my writing through the years but i think those early influences have always been there in varying degrees the pikes always had a bit of that flavour but on my own ive been able to take the music as far as i want in that direction you just cant beat the sound of a pedal steel singing away
5848997 i seem to be able to give some dark subjects a pretty poppy sound
5848998 i think it all stems from my childhood too much hay fever medication being bullied around insomnia jane austen novels but for the most part its a happy record i felt like i was coming back to life when the seeds were sown for this album and i had fun damn it
5848999 to be blunt i had a drinking problem and ive definitely battled some demons over the past few years
5849000 i seem to have a talent for finding humour in some fairly pathetic situations and ive always tried to be honest in my songs if nothing else its selfishly cathartic i think sometimes you have to fall down to the bottom of the well to notice the beauty of the light and the smell of the fresh air at the top
5849001 its your job to find that link that brings together their vision of the production with your skills in enhancing that vision with your music sometimes it just clicks other times you have to really dig around to find it but when it really works it feels great
5849002 when im writing my songs i dont answer to anyone but myself for better or worse its complete freedom but when im writing for a producer its for them to convey their visual art and hopefully to inject some of my own heart into whats going on ive been very lucky in that ive worked with many people who have given me a lot of space creatively speaking
5849003 initial strategic review of the business and the quarterly financial review
5849004 well you can say that im the one curly fry in the box of the regular

5849008 nothing has really gotten the press or the worlds attention about war protests like this has
5849009 theres been this wonderfully out of proportion knee jerk response its clever inflammatory and symbolic
5849010 its an indication that the 60s are not completely dead in berkeley
5849011 the tragedy is that the issue of the war seems to have gotten lost the issue instead has become berkeley itself and i dont think thats what the city council had in mind
5849012 but well take the heat and the attacks even though were under a lot of pressure i think its fair to say this war is a misuse of our young people and well stand up for that
5849013 huge protests tonight at berkeley city council meeting over military recruiting
5849014 to the business community of berkeley california your city council did not have your interest at heart when they used their political power to make a stand against the war in iraq it is obvious that they did not consider the backlash from the rest of the country on your business i think you should remind them that they were elected to protect your interests as a community and not use their power to express their own idealistic viewpoints as individuals they can accomplish this without using their political office as a microphone im sorry to say that your mayor and the city council have failed you and i think come election time you should remember this
5849015 greloc cannot open file long path to temporary build files here

5849020 immediately the owners came out and changed the gas prices they brought it down we had marvellous success down in st louis missouri
5849021 we believe not just in prayer because we believe that faith without works is dead so weve encouraged people to car pool more and organise their days more because its a combination of faith with these other factors
5849022 we just thank god for blessing us with small victories and we expect greater things to come
5849023 i have a magazine article you will be very interested in
5849024 on november 23 1992 shevardnadze announced that he had become a born again christian and had been baptized at a georgian orthodox cathedral

5849029 i dont think it would be productive for our football team you have to be a productive part to be an nfl player and theres responsibilities to being an nfl player its a privilege its not a right theres a lot that comes with being an nfl football player
5849030 looking at the radar it looks like were right on the path
5849031 it seems to be getting worse we may be sailing in our neighborhood
5849032 leukophoresis is just to extract the white cells giving back to the patient the red the serum and everything
5849033 when we have just the white cells we grow in our petri dish until we have a sufficient number
5849034 they will still need an injection very close to the site where the pancreas is but it will be under the skin injection so its very safe and its no different than doing an allergy test
5849035 over 20 million people have diabetes and if i can help thats 20 million people you know im going to do it
5849036 the best traditional metal album for 2008 arrived if there is a band who can ignite again the fire of heavy metal scene then it is sabaton
5849037 with this great new album sabaton will climb a little bit closer to the true metal throne
5849038 is it possible to do what we want to do with our current toolset
5849039 has anyone else in the organization already solved this problem
5849040 i took a sharepoint class with you last year and i was wondering if you knew who was in charge of training now

5849046 isolated to a batch of garlic we are no longer using
5849047 and you say i never do anything to help out around the house
5849048 sixty percent of employers report they currently offer flexible schedules to employees and 39 percent plan to provide more flexible work arrangements in 2008
5849049 in a nutshell its taking one job and dividing it into two and allowing two people to fulfill the duties of one job in our job sharing in my role i work two days and my counterpart works three days
5849050 if you dont really think through ahead of time how the job is going to be divided there could be some overlap which could possibly lead to some communication problems
5849051 do you have any advice for people that are considering job sharing
5849052 the first step would be to evaluate the current position and really think through whether that position could be divided and would it still be a successful position with two people the second step would be to go to your hr department and see if they would consider it make sure that you have all your questions answered that management might be interested to know
5849053 you know we really should back up everything on your computer
5849054 ciao sei bellissimo ti andrebbe di uscire con me tvb sofia

5849058 no matter what dynamic is at work i would argue that this relationship whatever it is between god and man is becoming frayed
5849059 who can say where things would be if it atheism enjoyed as long a run in the west as christianity for instance with all of these things in mind it is my conclusion that gods days may be numbered god may be on the side of believers but history may not be and if that is any indication we could very well see a godless culture in the next generation or two
5849060 spero che la spada di peter sia pi affilata della sua penna

5849063 its an unusually volatile election with a very high number of undecided voters and so many moving parts
5849064 if we hadnt laid the groundwork for the last year we couldnt be delivering now
5849065 but were incredibly confident in the organization we have to get out the vote
5849066 one thing you know about me is that i have been vetted ive been through this i understand exactly what is coming at me and there isnt any new information i mean its just more of the same its been recycled over and over again i dont think we can say that about my opponent

5849074 ive gotten literally hundreds of letters over the last week from women saying they would still love it if she were the nominee or if he would pick her
5849075 theres a case for hillary to be on the ticket but the real question is is bill a voice for the campaign and the administration and what do you do about disclosing all of the donors to his foundation and his library
5849076 picking her would have a groundswell impact on democrats but not picking her will leave her to have a new role leading on her issues and supporting barack for president
5849077 i think the convention will help bring the wings of the party together especially the fact that senator clintons name will be put in nomination for a roll call vote that will make a big difference
5849078 as for picking senator clinton as vice president thats senator obamas decision
5849079 to suppose that the reactions are widespread in those social animals that form relationships based on individuality
5849080 in other words grief will occur in species where there are prolonged relationships involving individual recognition based on parental care kinship or mutual benefit
5849081 studies of the mental processes of other animals indicate that the conceptual level necessary for understanding death has not been achieved

5849116 i spent a long time on the telephone with colin powell on the sunday before the vote and colin powell assured me they were going to do all of the planning necessary they were not going to rush to war he assured me that they were going to do all the inspections and exhaust the remedies of the united nations and finish the diplomacy
5849117 if you were to talk colin powell today or then deputy secretary of state richard armitage theyll tell you they misled colin powell and through him the rest of us were given evidence that never would have passed scrutiny
5849118 they did rush to war they didnt do the planning they didnt exhaust the remedies and as i said in a speech on the floor of the senate if they dont do these things that they promised i will oppose what theyre doing if he goes unilaterally i will oppose it and thats exactly what i did
5849119 i spent a lot of time trying to understand precisely what the extent of that evidence was
5849120 what has not been written about a lot is the due diligence that i did leading up to that vote i went to the united nations security council and i met with every single one of our security council ambassadors in a meeting i am the only senator i think that took the time to do that i spent two hours with them learning from them what their perceptions were from their countries about saddam husseins weaponry they agreed that iraq undoubtedly had weapons and that there needed to be some kind of inspection process put in place and they believed that they needed more time to put that in place ultimately we were going have to hold them accountable

5849139 i was always overwhelmed with emotions and didnt know what to do i felt angry anxious and afraid
5849140 i thought i was supposed to be responsible for the whole family
5849141 even if my parents had a little fight i thought i had failed to keep the family together i worried about their finances and taking care of my younger sister nikki
5849142 i felt controlled by everyone in my life my parents my pastor even my friends
5849143 my dad died and i didnt want to bother my mom i had no one to talk to
5849144 i couldnt stand all the pressure to be perfect in everything i did
5849145 i wasnt fitting in at school i had no friends and felt really lonely
5849146 i honestly dont know why i do it i just feel empty inside
5849147 rarely is the driving force behind cutting as clean as we would like it to be usually its a combination of several things
5849148 i felt like im the one in control instead of everyone else
5849149 it helped me feel like im here like i am living and maybe i matter
5849150 when i did it i could escape my fears and anxieties
5849151 i felt like i was bad like i needed to punish myself
5849152 i did it to survive otherwise i might have ended my life
5849153 is just not something were talking about enough with kids
5849154 youre going to get the impression theres something wrong with you because you feel intense pain
5849155 his identity began to unravel and i eventually discovered the man was a well known criminal fraudster
5849156 my brother was a runner my sister did continuity my uncle did all the lighting my aunty did the catering my cousins also did the catering and helped out an old friend from school played one of the sheep shearers it was crazy we all knew each other

5849160 i dont think ill have much trouble in greymouth and i think i might be all right in hokitika
5849161 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5849162 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that
5849163 he slept on his arm the other night and he came in and felt some tingling in his fingertips
5849164 as far as pain goes its not that much pain at all with it its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered until now
5849165 we are aware of his passport number and will happily assist mr gadd to the intended destination in case he has second thoughts about stopping off here
5849166 to not be overly clogging my head with baseball scenarios
5849167 im obviously excited to get out of the house and back on the field
5849168 i was only home for five or six days i was able to keep throwing and due diligence to stay ready
5849169 hes deemed entirely healthy hes built up as much as he needs to be to pitch long out of the pen hes ready to go today well utilize him from the sixth inning on
5849170 we dont know exactly what were going to do yet for saturday well see how it goes through this series then well make a decision probably at the last minute
5849171 keep the ball down change speeds and get ahead in the count thats about it
5849172 im in limbo ill just test it every day by playing catch and take the next step from there
5849173 to not be overly clogging my head with baseball scenarios
5849174 im obviously excited to get out of the house and back on the field
5849175 i was only home for five or six days i was able to keep throwing and due diligence to stay ready
5849176 hes deemed entirely healthy hes built up as much as he needs to be to pitch long out of the pen hes ready to go today well utilize him from the sixth inning on
5849177 we dont know exactly what were going to do yet for saturday well see how it goes through this series then well make a decision probably at the last minute
5849178 keep the ball down change speeds and get ahead in the count thats about it
5849179 im in limbo ill just test it every day by playing catch and take the next step from there
5849180 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5849181 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5849182 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5849183 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5849184 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5849185 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5849186 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5849187 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5849188 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5849189 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
5849190 im very frustrated but theres not much for me to do
5849191 i want to play i want to compete theres only so much time in a career and i want to get out there and help my teammates were in a great situation right now were leading our division and weve got a great chance to go to the playoffs and you want to be a part of that
5849192 its a dangerous area it is in the elbow it is in the tendon
5849193 we didnt expect to have more swelling today you expected to have less swelling and the fact that you have more swelling thats a concern and thats why if it goes that route we have to be more careful and be more conservative
5849194 well just try to match up the best way we can
5849195 the thing i want to be careful of at this stage of the season is anointing someone as that person and then that doesnt work out
5849196 i do not necessarily determine the role the relief pitcher determines the role
5849197 im considering everybody from the gulf coast league to triple a can any of yall throw
5849198 the reality is true proven guys are not going to get through
5849199 i feel comfortable that the answer when billys not here is in that room
5849200 the guys in there are going to have to step up i think weve got the guys
5849201 were not the only team that goes through this and we have to find a way to get it done
5849202 gravierende missst nde in der versorgung von psychiatrischen patientinnen im verantwortungsbereich der gemeinde wien
5849203 obviously well evaluate him every day he gets in here and see how his knee is holding up

5849205 we have to wait and see how some things come out and then ill give it to you on thursday
5849206 it feels a lot better than it has which is a good sign its coming out good the more i play catch the better it feels

5849212 there are some negatives they missed but thats what i wanted them to miss
5849213 its so unreal to spend all your time at a desk eight hours a day or whatever thats not real life you have to work and interact with all ages not just your age
5849214 talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road when you lie down and when you get up
5849215 their academic preparation typically is self directed and initiated which builds strong research skills since many of them work at their own pace many will go far beyond a traditional curriculum
5849216 were still very very close and we always have been i think thats due to homeschooling we were always there for our children so theyre always there for us
5849217 thats why its hard to make a determination we need something thats standardized
5849218 for homeschooled students because so little weight can be given to the transcript in terms of what the gpa means or how the student has competed among a group of peers a lot more weight is given to standardized test scores either the sat or act so if test scores are strong we judge the transcript to be strong if test scores are weak we judge the transcript to be weak thats about the only way weve found to objectively evaluate homeschooled students
5849219 the admissions committee and other scholarship committees view a home school gpa as helpful but we place greater weight on the standardized test scores a student with a 4 0 gpa is questioned if he has a 720 sat total a student with a 4 0 and a 1300 sat total has confirmed his academic preparation
5849220 a parents education background has no substantive effect on their sic childrens home school academic performance
5849221 shed always say when she came back home the next year well that was fun because i got to be with my friends but now im going to learn something
5849222 apple has determined that in very rare cases batteries in first generation ipod nanos sold between september 2005 and december 2006 can overheat causing failure and deformation of the ipod nano apple has received very few reports of such incidents less than 0 001 percent of first generation ipod nano units which have been traced back to a single battery supplier there have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage and no reports of incidents for any other ipod nano model any first generation ipod nano customers who have experienced their battery overheating should contact applecare for a replacement any other customers who have concerns about their first generation ipod nano battery should also contact applecare
5849223 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice
5849224 hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
5849225 what were primarily seeing is that there is an increase in vegetation in northern canada
5849226 areas that were normally occupied by herbs for example are becoming occupied by shrubs were seeing a migration of the tree line northwards these sorts of changes have implications on wildlife and the people who depend on wildlife in the north
5849227 i have seen a lot of people challenging others to races since michael has been doing so well
5849228 now theyre suddenly starting to think i can be like mike
5849229 it is possible to get to a level that up to this point people thought was impossible
5849230 im trying to get my work done today and the phones ringing off the hook
5849231 weve just experienced the greatest media attention that weve ever experienced as a sport
5849232 michael phelps has taken it to a whole new level
5849233 i learned that if you kick harder on your streamlines then you can go farther
5849234 if i was michael phelps right now i would probably be swimming
5849235 because swimming to me is really fun and also it would keep him in shape
5849236 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5849237 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that
5849238 he slept on his arm the other night and he came in and felt some tingling in his fingertips
5849239 as far as pain goes its not that much pain at all with it its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered until now
5849240 the mystics have not moved one ounce in their 11 year history and weve got to start making some changes it is the only way this team is going to survive
5849241 if i cant move the marker here im going to lose my fan base im going to lose my corporate support and i just might as well shut down and i dont want to do that i want to make a difference in this team i want a winning team
5849242 our issue has not been lack of effort it has been lack of talent
5849243 this is pro basketball and good coaching and gutty performances can only take a team so far the mystics need athletes and we need scorers and we need a roster of young ladies whose collective physical skills make other teams in the league dread the thought of playing us
5849244 the mystics have been operating for too long without a long term plan
5849245 in the three years that i have been an owner and a general partner our thinking has been far too shortsighted and our player personnel decisions are far too needs based that all ends today
5849246 shes done a wonderful job and she knows what our new mission is

5849301 he struck her and may have pushed her around a little bit
5849302 our findings do not support the use of b vitamins as secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease
5849303 despite widespread acknowledgement that obesity is endangering the health of millions of americans the country is still failing to respond clearly or comprehensively
5849304 we must work together governments schools and communities to improve nutrition and increase physical activity for all ages we must ensure that strong policies are implemented and enforced in every state not only to help reverse existing obesity rates but to prevent obesity among our nations children and generations to come
5849305 its a revolution in thinking about the origin of heart disease the cholesterol hypothesis has been that eating an exces
5849306 this confirms what a lot of recent studies have found no benefit of taking vitamin b supplements to reduce the risk of heart disease and it raises a few red flags
5849307 we could not detect any preventive effect of intervention with folic acid plus vitamin b12 or with vitamin b6 on mortality or major cardiovascular events
5849308 there is no evidence that individuals should take b vitamins to decrease the risk of heart disease and there may be some evidence that they shouldnt

5849316 sono molto contento di come sono andati questi due giorni di test le modifiche di assetto che abbiamo trovato ieri si sono confermate molto positive anche oggi mi hanno permesso di ripetere il mio miglior giro di ieri che avevo ottenuto con una nuova gomma sperimentale anche con la stessa gomma che ho usato in gara domenica e di migliorarlo ulteriormente di alcuni decimi con una gomma sperimentale ancora diversa da quella di ieri la bridgestone sta facendo un buon lavoro ma sono soprattutto contento di questo nuovo set up che migliora la nostra moto sotto tutti gli aspetti e sar utile per le prossime gare ho provato anche due qualifiche ma non ho spinto molto anche perch sinceramente in questo momento le prestazioni in qualifica non mi preoccupano affatto ma voglio solo concentrarmi su come migliorare per le gare e cercare di fare del nostro meglio da qui alla fine del campionato

5849318 i made it to match because this will be a perfect beer girl costume the blouse is a blouse i already owned the only other company i have bought from that makes their own designs and makes clothing to order is this place called cameo intimates com
5849319 its called a raquel cami garter and i purchased it from trashy com trashy lingerie is based out of los angeles and their own seamstresses make these items as you order them they have the best lingerie as far as quality and originality anywhere that cami garter costs about 150 bucks and the matching thong costs about 40 its a little expensive for lingerie but this is not something that will ever fall apart because its so well made hey when you lounge around the house in sexy lingerie all day you need to buy stuff that will take a little wear and tear i wear a bra i bought from them in my video ultimate cherry brady interview its called the cameo sheer comfort bra in the color sunflower its a 36g and its very comfortable both companies should take pride because they are really putting out some quality products
5849320 thats one example the laws in your countries say that homosexual acts actions are punishable by various rules i dont need to argue
5849321 if the practice homosexuality is now found to be in our society
5849322 it is of service to be against it alright and to that extent what my understanding is is that those that are responsible for law and order will want to prevent wholesale importation of foreign practices and traditions that are not consistent with native standards native way of life
5849323 so that people who find themselves in a position where they go away from the word of god the same word of god can bring them back to life and that is in uganda as already archbishop akinola is saying

5849327 naturally were disappointed but we can still finish first and reach the play offs
5849328 grozav este purul adevar sunt mama unui astfel de specimen era in anul 4 de facultate pana in noembrie anul trecut era un student destul de bun in noembrie a dat de wow si de atunci a ajuns un zombi nu stiu cwe sa mai fac este plecat de pe lumea asta am ajuns sa cred ca mai bine il omor eu decat sa il vad cum se distruge singur nu stiti ce simt ca mama cand vad ditamai omul care sta cate 18 20 de ore si omoara la zgorogi
5849329 the supreme courts decision let wrongdoers off the hook without any responsibility for the consequences of their actions
5849330 it simply defies any reasonable sense of justice to let wrongdoers corporate or individual walk away from a problem they helped create
5849331 landlords are responsible for maintaining a home safe from lead homeowners are responsible for keeping their kids safe taxpayers are responsible for paying medical expenses and abatement costs of lead
5849332 yet the corporations that started this public health crisis bear no responsibility under the supreme courts opinion they got away scot free justice was not served
5849333 you cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today
5849334 rev martin luther king jr taught us that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly
5849335 the supreme courts closing of the door on a just solution to their problem is a great injustice that affects us all
5849336 the supreme court said that their hearts go out to those children whose lives forever have been changed by the poisonous presence of lead
5849337 but they should be reminded of the admonition from saint augustine who said charity is no substitute for justice withheld
5849338 s de alguien un seat blanco aparcado delante del mio m s que nada porqu llego
5849339 hay que ser idiota para venir a escuchar a alguien a quien han elegido en privado para que les robe
5849340 these four lawmakers have worked tirelessly to address georgias critical transportation needs
5849341 we commend them for moving the ball on this important issue
5849342 when it comes to energy consumers are much more cost conscious
5849343 control or lack of it is a highly emotional value tied to a core american value the freedom of choice and should be leveraged in messaging
5849344 we are extremely pleased with the outcome of this transaction which further strengthens our liquidity position
5849345 despite the fact that the industry continues to face stubbornly high fuel prices and a deteriorating economic environment this transaction demonstrates the markets confidence in us airways ability to persevere in these new and challenging times while we still have a lot of hard work to do our business transformation plan continues to gain momentum and we look forward to reporting on our other initiatives that are currently under way
5849346 it is with much regret that we accept toms resignation
5849347 we understand toms desire to pursue his career development and to spend more time with his family we wish tom all the best for the future and appreciate his dedication professionalism and friendship over his 17 years of service here
5849348 several influential community leaders recently asked that i consider offering myself as a candidate
5849349 having given most of my adult life to furthering the interests of the city and its people it is a call that i must give serious consideration
5849350 hes got a lot of experience and name recognition both in the legislative and judicial branches of government
5849351 i am deeply involved in several initiatives to save atlantas youth from the downward spiral of crime
5849352 these volunteer efforts along with the daily work of my judgeship make this a very difficult time to consider redirecting my life
5849353 people who live and work in erickson communities nationwide have a history of supporting these three groups through board membership volunteerism donations and participation in fundraising events
5849354 europe has a lot of good players and a host of very promising young guys but who among them has a great record
5849355 the big picture is that there are several dimensions in which games have effects
5849356 should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
5849357 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
5849358 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
5849359 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
5849360 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
5849361 therefore it is simply ridiculous and wrong to try to silence a pastor accusing him of interfering in politics so that he cannot do good to the soul of a member of his flock
5849362 i read this question on the message board today i wanted to hear what you guys had to say about it
5849363 an airplane is sitting on an enormous treadmill as the plane starts its engines the treadmill runs in the opposite direction at the same speed the plane is moving can the plane take off
5849364 first the belt speed did not match the wheel speed second the fact that it was a prop plane made a huge difference ever heard of bernoullis principle the propeller generated wind which blew over the wings providing the lift necessary for the plane to take off put a jet on that thing no way it would take off
5849365 people ask me all the time about my whisper rock type of sound all i can say to them is that the quieter my vocals are the more an audience is apt to listen to the lyrics and when i decide to get loud i do it because the lyric calls for it and if i do it sparingly it means more each time
5849366 this record represents the last two years of my life its about falling in and out of love the world in which i live my friends my family but most of all its a loss of innocence record in writing these songs i am trying to get back to where i started while also growing as an artist simultaneously not a very easy task but one that i will continue to struggle with for the rest of my creative life it helps when people like patty griffin rob schnapf lenny castro and greg leisz jump on board i still cant believe i was fortunate enough to work with them this record is exactly the way i intended it to be and i hope people dig it
5849367 and i probably wont again until its my own as i cannot imagine topping that experience
5849368 i am ecstatic to have heidi voigt join our swimming staff at nmsu
5849369 she is extremely professional and has a great amount of experience that will help lead our team to the next level
5849370 it says a lot about where we have come in a short time to be able to hire such a quality coach
5849371 its nice that a lot of coaches think we have a pretty good program and its definitely a positive
5849372 ive always said that polls dont win games for you and even though a team looks good on paper you still have to prove that on the court
5849373 were all excited to get the season started and hopefully we can play up to our potential
5849374 we know we have a very very tough schedule and we play against some of the best teams in the country and stanford texas and oregon are all great teams while texas and stanford have the potential to win a national championship this season
5849375 if we compete well and in games late we will be on target its going to help us in conference play and hopefully in the ncaa tournament
5849376 i know what its like to be married to an icon
5849377 adapted from an unproduced screenplay by tennessee williams will have its world premiere sept
5849378 als jullie je samen eens vervelen mogen jullie mij wel bellen hoor
5849379 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5849380 what were seeing with the clones they present are the ones that look good
5849381 clone enough dogs and occasionally you have offspring that arent perfect
5849382 but its comparable to what you have through conventional breeding
5849383 more than 7 billion in losses are attributed to illegal internet distributions while 11 billion is the result of illegal copying and bootlegging
5849384 global theft of sound recordings cost the u s economy 12 5 billion in lost revenue and more than 71 000 jobs and 2 billion in wages to u s workers
5849385 develop a plan for offering alternatives to illegal downloading or peer to peer distribution of intellectual property as well as to plan to explore technology based deterrents to prevent such illegal activity
5849386 from all the salesmen looking a pr0n during their off hours
5849387 the hummer is way too expensive for the chinese military and demand from civilian buyers is not big enough to justify a purchase especially with oil prices running near an all time high
5849388 unless someone is going to acquire it for military use i just dont see it being a viable product line
5849389 then again if you do a complete overhaul you would take hummer away from what defines it and makes it the brand that it is
5849390 obviously we are very sensitive to the disaster that happened and the need for absolute transparency
5849391 every entry judged will have individual judges comments and we will include on the back of each award who the judge was
5849392 judges will include faculty members from the poynter institute a journalism think tank based in st petersburg fla
5849393 it certainly flies in the face of the spirit of financial disclosure
5849394 in texas we have a long tradition of not talking about the number of cattle you own or your net worth
5849395 a blind trust businesswise is not very different from this grantor trust but youre taxed on passive income versus income
5849396 identification of each trust asset if known to the beneficiary from which income was received by the beneficiary in excess of 500
5849397 dewhursts lawyer ed shack said dewhurst cant identify which assets are producing more than 500 because the proceeds get
5849398 in my interpretation of the law you only have two choices you either disclose your assets if its in a regular trust or you have a blind trust
5849399 there is short covering in the market as the crop reports are good additional area in the state may come under guar seed
5849400 guarseed prices are likely to trade sideways with positive bias on continued short covering however some fresh selling may emerge at higher levels due to higher crop estimates
5849401 the uncertainty with regard to financials has kept the downward pressure on
5849402 home prices keep falling assets continue to deteriorate the economy continues to slow which can only worsen the unemployment rate and increase delinquencies
5849403 theres seemingly no end to this cycle and thats to the detriment of any financial stock
5849404 what its showing is that theres a great deal of concern about the solvency of these companies
5849405 consumers are not likely to make very large ticket purchases when prospects in the labor market are weakening and confidence remains very low
5849406 i thank you all for your support of our family it has been hard to deal with but life must go on
5849407 if you would like to make a donation to help our family we have set up a paypal account to do so contact for more details
5849408 i was doing it out of the kindness of my heart but i was also being deceived and i felt really stupid
5849409 wanna hear what the bear did to barry this one time
5849410 barry told me one day he said whyd you save me and he cried a little bit why didnt you just let me die in there i couldnt help it i burst out laughing right in his face
5849411 jij bent gewoon verliefd op de liefde en geniet met volle teugen van de seks die daarbij komt kijken
5849412 ik vind het ook heel fijn om jou weer te zien lief
5849413 needs to figure out if hes going to let rush limbaugh and the right wing of his party direct his choice
5849414 john mccain is pro life always has been and his administration will be pro life anyone picked as his vice president will respect those views
5849415 after careful consideration our board rejected the offer after concluding that their proposal was not in the best interest of our stockholders
5849416 the board believes the 5 25 offering price does not reflect the value of heelys and that entering into discussions with skechers based on their unsolicited proposal is premature at this time
5849417 we may wind up airing some of it on cnbc or maybe the usa network and then cut away to something else
5849418 were basically going to treat it like the hammer throw
5849419 if there are some plagiarized bits in this speech hell stick them at the end after the audience has lost consciousness
5849420 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5849421 that is a comment that he typically gives for people who ask about the vice presidency
5849422 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5849423 try to remember hunger poverty injustice environmental destruction and global warming are just the symptoms overpopulation is the disease
5849424 the idea that we might grow too big can be disproved only for the moment never for good
5849425 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5849426 if you have a few hundred followers and you let some of them molest children they call you a cult leader
5849427 why is larry king giving this guy yet another platform to spew hate filled propaganda against millions of catholics
5849428 why are we letting this kind of bigotry stand theres been enough anti catholicism in this country we dont need larry king and bill maher fanning the flames of hate
5849429 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5849430 an unnamed source at an american isp says staff there briefly

5849437 especially if this ruling is appealed us v boucher could become a landmark case the question of whether a criminal defendant can be legally compelled to cough up his encryption passphrase remains an unsettled one with law review articles for the last decade arguing the merits of either approach
5849438 thousands of images of adult pornography and animation depicting adult and child pornography
5849439 i tend to think judge niedermeier was wrong given the specific facts of this case
5849440 they point out where your expectations of your capabilities may be overstated
5849441 they may reveal to you things you havent thought about its a good way of testing that youre going to do the job the way you think you were its the difference between doing drills and doing a scrimmage
5849442 none of the players took 100 percent of the correct right actions if they had we wouldnt have done our job as planners
5849443 any time you get a group of information technology experts together theres always a desire lets show them what we can do
5849444 whether its intent was embarrassment or a prank we had to temper the enthusiasm of the players
5849445 this is one of those technologies that makes it possible to turn net neutrality on its head
5849446 all three of them had done work with respect to the accelerator at brookhaven which walter wagner challenged back in the day
5849447 have apparently not educated themselves about the extensive analysis that has been done
5849448 theyre just being way off the wall on the facts
5849449 its wasting lots of time and effort to argue against this but i think its important to dispose of this as soon as possible
5849450 there is no way that the lhc will produce black holes capable of swallowing up the earth
5849451 this claim is based on extremely well tested theories of physics and on observations of the cosmos
5849452 but it is notable how often we have been asked about the problem
5849453 and we especially want to refute those like dr r ssler who try to use science to back up their claims
5849454 the beam of particles has the energy of a eurostar train traveling at full speed and should something happen to destabilize the particle beam there is a real danger that all of that energy will be deflected into the wall of the beam pipe and the magnets of the lhc causing a great deal of damage the lhc has several automatic safety systems in place that monitor all the critical parts of the lhc should anything unexpected happen power or magnet failure for example the beam is automatically dumped by being squirted into a blind tunnel where its energy is safely dissipated this all happens in milliseconds the beam which is traveling at 11 000 circuits of the lhc per second will complete less than three circuits before the dump is complete
5849455 in fact i think its wonderful if its done safely
5849456 i had a big big weekend i got married to portia de rossi sorry john stamos this ones taken
5849457 kendra wilkinson has been offered her own reality show about starting her life over again when she moves out of the playboy mansion hugh hefner knows her time is coming
5849458 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5849459 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5849460 we should whack them dell over linux dealings we should make sure they understand our value
5849461 im thinking of hitting the oems harder than in the past with anti linux they should do a delicate dance
5849462 i want it i want it i want it i want it
5849463 would i really give up all i have if i thought it might make a difference
5849464 the hummer is way too expensive for the chinese military and demand from civilian buyers is not big enough to justify a purchase especially with oil prices running near an all time high
5849465 unless someone is going to acquire it for military use i just dont see it being a viable product line
5849466 then again if you do a complete overhaul you would take hummer away from what defines it and makes it the brand that it is

5849473 a prototype from her paris hilton push up bra line
5849474 the cw and our studio partner cbs paramount network television have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere
5849475 were not hiding anything simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9 02 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5849476 there are a lot of people who are not here tonight but thanks to everyone who did make it
5849477 its all a bit sad to be honest with you
5849478 if she loves him then good for her but if it was done for attention its a bit sad
5849479 i did stuff like that when i was 19 as well like get a tattoo because it pissed my mum off
5849480 its just a great big cry for help and if anything people need to stop talking about her badly and you know maybe all she needs is a hug

5849494 hold barack obamas rhetoric to account and expose his record of political expedience
5849495 theres no doubt we cannot compete with the sheer weight of the democratic convention but what we can do is offer some loyal opposition
5849496 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5849497 big cats and dinosaurs if you see any of those give us a call
5849498 theres broadly two choices either make them a part of the federal financial safety net or distinctly private for my money id prefer to see them credibly and demonstrably privatized
5849499 despite what u s treasury secretary hank paulson said these giant mortgage guarantee agencies are not going to exist in their present form in a few years
5849500 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5849501 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
5849502 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
5849503 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away right away elections aint that kind of thing
5849504 there has been no evidence of any tampering on these machines
5849505 i think were the only county in the country that has that contract stipulation
5849506 i have a huge inventory of machines that i am not able to use
5849507 who wants to buy a system that has been decertified especially when other states are following suit
5849508 at some point and time we just have to figure out what the heck it is obviously its not what i want but at this juncture its something that needs to happen obviously theres something going on
5849509 i just have some numbness in fingers that obviously im not used to having as far as pain goes theres not very much pain at all with it its just like i said you have to figure out what it is or it gets so bad to where it gets to be a really bad problem
5849510 its something that weve dealt with like i said ive never had to deal with it on that level its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered like this until now
5849511 the judge today correctly found that it was unlikely that the cfaa would apply to security researchers giving an academic talk
5849512 a presentation at a security conference is not some sort of computer intrusion its a protected speech and vital to the free flow of information about computer security vulnerabilities
5849513 the mbta ultimately is trying to silence some uncomfortable truths that these students uncovered
5849514 they brought an action against three college kids rather than address the problems in their own house
5849515 i am disappointed the state assembly majority today failed to work across party lines with governor paterson senator aubertine senate democrats and senate republicans to cap soaring property taxes a circuit breaker alone without a tax cap is just not good enough rather its a job half done
5849516 i kind of feel like its like that already people are underage drinking all the time people may go a little crazy i dont know if it would be the best idea as people might go nuts
5849517 i think people do it more because they like to rebel so they like to do things i think its a very good idea
5849518 if you go downtown on any thursday friday or saturday night now youll see there are a lot of persons 18 or 19 who are now illegally drinking
5849519 basically theyve just been driving for a couple of years if they are able to get the alcohol legally and start experimenting with that and then get behind the car thats a whole other issue
5849520 this suggests that arsenic would play a role in the development of diabetes
5849521 but there clearly needs to be additional research conducted because our study has certain limitations we are conducting those studies now but thats going to take a few years
5849522 this is a good base for future research but its a small sample size and doesnt look at dose response
5849523 in terms of magnitude people in taiwan and bangladesh are exposed to at least 10 times higher levels compared to people in the u s
5849524 we were interested in investigating if arsenic exposure at low and moderate levels could be related to diabetes
5849525 i think its important that people realize that the olympic games can be gamed
5849526 its their way of showing see our system the chinese communist party put our country on top of the gold medals chart
5849527 were interested but we need to know who else is interested to know if were really interested
5849528 were interested but we need to know who else is interested to know if were really interested

5849540 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5849541 i like the environment a lot and they are rebuilding all their facilities so it should be pretty nice once its all done
5849542 im not thinking about recruiting too much yet i want to go where i have a good chance of playing early thats gonna be important but right now im taking it slow
5849543 i went to their camp and thought i did well i guess they want to see some more of me during the season but they are pretty interested
5849544 i didnt start watching college football until the eighth grade
5849545 i watched a lot of lsu because we had a local guy who went there
5849546 i like the environment a lot and they are rebuilding all their facilities so it should be pretty nice once its all done
5849547 my mom really wants me to stay close but my dad wants me to get away
5849548 i know they have good tradition and i feel like if i went there id have a good chance to play early
5849549 they have new coaches so things will be different there and they will be rebuilding
5849550 ive been watching them on tv a lot the last few years
5849551 it seems like a real good environment i just want to see them throw the ball more and hopefully the new coaches will do that
5849552 i have the ability to jump up and get the ball
5849553 i can break tackles for the short yards and make big things happen when i have the ball im like
5849554 i want to run smoother routes and work on my feet
5849555 shit my legs feel like theyre gonna fall off but im gonna keep running even though every step i take is fucking painful
5849556 how does it feel to have beaten mark spitzs record of 7 gold medals
5849557 uh um well um uh i mean i dont really know its just uh im not sure really
5849558 we dont expect to recover additional money in the near term as a result of this order
5849559 we are making efforts to have him returned to the united states
5849560 which bodes well for philadelphias international service and wed like to begin more service to europe and to the middle east and asia in the coming years
5849561 announcing our first service to the middle east is the perfect follow up to our london heathrow service which began in march
5849562 we appreciate us airways commitment to enhancing our citys economy and culture with this new service we look forward to working with us airways to further establish philadelphia as a major international gateway
5849563 you might be wondering why starting tel aviv is any different in an environment where fuel is costly
5849564 china is a developing international market from the united states whereas tel aviv is very established and we absolutely know that our tel aviv service has better economics
5849565 mr bush at long last has it not dawned on you that the america you have now created includes cold blooded killers who will kill people to achieve their political objectives
5849566 they are those in or formerly in your employ who may yet be charged some day with war crimes
5849567 im gonna print it out hang it up and memorize it
5849568 because i cant say shut the fuck up thats why frankly
5849569 you dont take keith on by just saying you cant do that
5849570 keith is reasonable but youve got to be smart keith is usually two steps ahead of me when i do come and say keith its a give and take
5849571 and its things like this that are keeping us the minor leagues that he was fired that afternoon
5849572 was i like him but is baltimore ready for him
5849573 regardless of the baggage he may or may not have i want to meet this guy and see if hes the real deal and he was
5849574 he thought that was going to compromise his objectivity and reporting
5849575 i didnt know at the time that he didnt like to fly but i think that he was probably right in his reasons
5849576 thats a six four three double play if youre scoring at home or if youre by yourself
5849577 he didnt want to do the story and it evolved into the hottest story of the time it made my life miserable it was bad and it did not end pretty
5849578 i can honestly tell you it shook me up a little bit
5849579 ive known keith for twenty seven years cnn first day he was in tv i knew right away that keith had something that id never seen he was made for this i mean the guy is crazy but he is made for this
5849580 sometimes i imagine that i hear a howl coming from there
5849581 i have been accused of having an obsession with him i am a minor leaguer compared to his obsession with me
5849582 if my child were killed in iraq i would blame the likes of jeffrey immelt
5849583 in the same sense that george bush lowered and made even more disreputable the presidency of the united states
5849584 i really do owe him a percentage of my salary
5849585 moral or intellectual confusion about what is right or wrong
5849586 the man who sees absolutes where all other men see nuances and shades of meaning is either a prophet or a quack
5849587 i really did think well if this is the end of my career i will have gone down for a good cause
5849588 thats what we keep hearing from the audience more and more is that they appreciate that we have people who are actually speaking truth to power or being transparent in their own personal viewpoints
5849589 in ways that msnbc never had a show take off
5849590 they want the shortcut wow that guys smart i get him in this crazy world of so much information you look for places where you identify or you see where you fit into the spectrum because you get all this information all day long
5849591 it is a newscast with commentary and analysis the way most really good newscasts used to be
5849592 dosages of the various components vary in a greater degree than were used to or maybe were even done in the heyday of this kind of thing but if you listen to those daily murrow newscasts in the forties on the radio murrow would do the news two and a half three minutes take a break and then do a two or three minute commentary
5849593 shut the hell up or posing the question regarding bush as olbermann did
5849594 there are people who with absolute conviction believe that brian williams is a communist
5849595 there are people who with absolute conviction believe that katie couric is in the pay of the pentagon there are people who are absolutely certain that charlie gibson sleeps with hillary clinton based on the last debate this is an old schoolyard thing i learned from being repeatedly beat up in the fourth grade it finally dawned on me one day they are going to keep beating me up whether i respond to them or not
5849596 brian sometimes looks like his collar button is going to burst from the restraint that he has i know the pain that he goes through he measures each word like an apothecary and they beat him up too the point is why not why not add something to the discourse
5849597 maybe in a years time after youve given me those three minutes to sort of reprogram maybe ill get four or five
5849598 hes not a reporter ive never seen anything that hes done that was original in terms of the information its all derivative i like him i agree with his perspective and i think hes very very good on television but hes not a newsman
5849599 ten years ago if he had done at cbs what he does every day on the air at msnbc he would have been fired by the end of the day
5849600 i think it would not do any worse than the three that are out there now
5849601 it would not get more than double the amount of protest that any of the shows have now
5849602 and now hes doing that in news there are those at nbc news who worry that griffin may be right
5849603 keith and i have each carved out our roles in this vast information spectrum
5849604 what cable emphasizes more and more is opinion or even advocacy whether its bill oreilly or keith olbermann or lou dobbs thats what that particular platform or venue does its not what i do what i do is different i try very very hard not to come up and say to people this is what i believe or this is good or this is bad but rather this is what im learning in my reporting or this is what my analysis shows based on my reporting and as long as i can do that im very very comfortable and nobody has asked me to do anything but that
5849605 ninety nine per cent of the people are passing you by you try to stop them and grab them thats most of cable news and then there are the lite in cable news olbermann oreilly they have audiences that come to them and theyre unique
5849606 if they are watching me in larger numbers than anything else on the network it would behoove the network to put me on as often as possible especially in a political context
5849607 and its under constant examination theres dialogue going on behind the scenes all the time its not perfectly sorted out
5849608 we are creating a new universe and it has all kinds of new laws and science and physics coming into play as well in this information world
5849609 and youve got planets out there colliding with each other new life forms taking shape others have drifted too close to the sun and theyve burned up and we dont know how its all going to settle down and it has now and forevermore a radiant effect
5849610 i believe msnbc really needs to bring in a medical team at this point i dont know what happened to him i really dont he didnt use to be this way
5849611 there were a few things that i could see were going to be impediments
5849612 i cannot imagine that kind of evil knee jerk reflex
5849613 im sure you dont want people to conclude that there is really no distinction between the news as reported on nbc and the opinion as reported on msnbc despite the increasing blurring of those lines
5849614 we always read with great interest what the white house sends us
5849615 and we wake up the next day and do what we do for a living
5849616 the business of making judgments before the polls have closed and trying to stampede in effect the process
5849617 i think that the people out there are going to begin to make some judgments about us if they havent already if we dont begin to temper that temptation to constantly try to get ahead of what the voters are deciding
5849618 me doing a commentary against my own opinion is pandering black and white and im not going to do it would i pull back a little bit or think long and hard about whether or not i want to knowingly alienate part of the audience yeah and i did i mean i held fire on senator clinton for quite a while after she began to really scare me with some of these tactics
5849619 my husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the california primary somewhere in the middle of june right we all remember bobby kennedy was assassinated in june in california
5849620 why in the name of all that all of us hold dear would anybody ever say anything like this
5849621 can she in good conscience continue in the race for president after having said anything like this is her political career at an end
5849622 because a senator a politician a person who can let hang in midair the prospect that she might just be sticking around in part just in case the other guy gets shot has no business being and no capacity to be the president of the united states
5849623 when you look at the states that she won and the popular vote that she piled up and the number of delegates that she has on her side shes got real bargaining power in all of this
5849624 i mean six home runs six minutes worth of home runs one after the other out of the ballpark
5849625 it was like you meet a guy and you fall in love with him and hes funny and hes clever and hes witty and hes all these great things
5849626 and then you commit yourself to him and he turns out to be a jerk and difficult and brutal and that is how the hillary viewers see him its true but i do think theyre going to come back theres nowhere else to go
5849627 those questions are best left to the mccain campaign at this time
5849628 all the negative attacks from the mccain campaign seem to have been paying off
5849629 as a guitarist composer barrios is the best of the lot regardless of era his music is better formed its more poetic its more everything
5849630 tutti hanno un miglior amico con cui fare del sesso orale tranne me
5849631 if anything the presence of a grandfather was associated with decreased survival of grandchildren
5849632 it doesnt surprise me that men in those societies live longer than men in monogamous societies where they become widowed and have nobody to care for them
5849633 it is necessary that the church not only shows more support and openness to these apostates but also teaches and advises all members bishops stake presidents etc who usually dont know how to deal with such a situation in terms of organizational and ecclesiastical questions and out of insecurity fail to treat the critical member with the necessary love and respect that even a normal stranger would receive
5849634 in the current economic condition people are driving less and it obviously affects every facet of the u s auto industry including how often they replace tires or buy new cars
5849635 the current economic condition further impacted the stores but they were not performing well before this year and we dont expect them to perform well

5849669 they never shunned her for her music or her lyrics
5849670 eles concederam apenas doze gols durante toda a temporada e s dois ambos de p nalti nas ltimas oito rodadas uma estat stica que se deve principalmente ao her ico goleiro victor e a obstinada defesa formada por leo rever thiego e especialmente pereira

5849678 if you know your site was infected dont you have an ethical responsibility to provide a warning shouldnt we change the rules so that the guy with a sexually transmitted disease has to say hes infecting people
5849679 if this were to prevent one breach of someones private data the good would have outweighed the expense
5849680 the real problem is that no one is fixing their sites
5849681 the same tens of thousands of sites get infected over and over with different malware using the same methods a few class action lawsuits could be a good incentive to fix this
5849682 should hundreds of millions of disclosure messages have gone out we dont want to create unnecessary noise or panic or distract from the messages that really matter
5849683 we have a real problem with hard data in our industry and we need a kind of statistical clearinghouse

5849757 we have been told by expert consultants in the field that discharging excess water to the river is a viable option
5849758 in some ways it is a more environmentally sensitive option as irrigation takes a lot of energy
5849759 if the planning department says they do have consent to discharge then we are obliged to assess their application
5849760 while this situation has always been a fear we were given assurances by minister sartor that this mine was not licensed to discharge
5849761 right from the very start of the proposed mine community concerns have centered on the probability of discharge of polluted water from the mine into mammy johnsons river and from there into the karuah river and eventually into port stephens itself

5849773 nou eh als we in afrika hadden gewoond had u ook doodgeboren kunnen zijn
5849774 als we in afrika hadden gewoond was de kans groter geweest dat jij putjesschepper in plaats van dokter was geworden
5849775 het zou handig wezen als de dingen omhoog zouden vallen voor jou
5849776 vrij nederland las ik vroeger ook voordat ik overspannen werd
5849777 ik zit hier al vanaf 9 uur vanochtend van de therapeut moet ik er elke dag uit om de zinnen wat te verzetten trouwens wat moet een mens met deze luchten binnen het is weer om verliefd te worden maar daar heb ik geen zin in dat heeft me juist gek en overspannen gemaakt
5849778 gek was ik op die vrouw een schoonheid was het niet maar zij had iets wat mij aantrok een korte ragebol als kapsel en een open gezicht met blauwe kijkers die je direct konden aankijken en zij was serieus hoewel lachen ook in haar repertoire zat maar mijn humor kon ze dan weer niet waarderen zeker niet als ik een luchtige opmerking over vrouwen maakte want zij was en is een feministe die de leer zeer serieus neemt
5849779 ik heb haar na een leuke avond uit eens gezoend wat zij beantwoorde met passievolle gretigheid en heb daarna mijn liefde verklaard verder is het nooit gekomen
5849780 zij had dus een hoop gevoel maar helaas voor u van beton
5849781 inderdaad een paar maanden geleden heb ik nog een brief gestuurd naar haar praktijk met de vraag of ze contact met mij wilde opnemen mijn psychiater vond dat een goed idee
5849782 nee nee mijn psych is een vrouw en dol op motoren
5849783 en hebt u nog reactie gekregen van haar uw voormalige geliefde
5849784 gisteren heeft zij mij gebeld maar ik zat hier zoals elke dag en is door haar mijn voicemail ingesproken dat zij er geen behoefte aan hernieuwd contact iets met een geschiedenis die ze liever vergeet
5849785 therapeutisch zeer verantwoord het is ook geen manier om via een voicemail op een brief te antwoorden
5849786 vanochtend was ik toch nog verdrietig maar ben ik toch om 9 uur het park ingegaan zoals elke dag
5849787 alles waar je niet dood aan gaat maakt je sterker
5849788 county zoning regulations have a legal description of the city of hays 3 mile boundary which may be a problem in itself
5849789 the boundarys always changing you really cant have a 3 mile map out there and call it this is the 3 mile boundary it may be different next month than it is this month
5849790 were getting this information to the developer also just so theyre exactly sure which ones are in which ones are out
5849791 the code is very specific the legal descriptions of the area
5849792 het is wel een mannensport jansen je bent toch geen zwanger wijf
5849793 de verzorging en het vreten zijn hier prima maar er wonen hier ook wat trullen jansen daar ben ik nog een goudhaan bij
5849794 nee maar het is wel de waarheid hier verderop woont er n en die loopt de hele dag om een zuster te roepen dat begint al om zeven uur s ochtends
5849795 net zei je nog dat ik er zo goed aan
5849796 ouwehoer niet zo daar kan jij toch niks aan doen je beweegt bijna niet
5849797 ik heb vroeger altijd de burgerlijke pers gemeden maar ja het vrije volk bestaat al jaren niet meer nou lezen we het ad maar daar staan artikelen in waar je een scheet van moet laten

5849799 windmills seem to have generated a lot of public interest
5849800 is not usable for a 12 month period it needs to be torn down and turned back to green
5849801 i think when the wind blows my trees make more noise
5849802 from what ive read i think 30 decibels is what they recommend
5849803 the level of noise produced during wind turbine operation shall not exceed 40 dba measured at the boundaries of all the closest parcels that are owned by non site owners
5849804 i dont think theyre good for the community any type of motorized device is going to break down
5849805 subdivision that creates more than one parcel cannot be used for a windmill on each parcel as long as it is owned by the same person
5849806 its time to decide if you want to look at windmills or do you want to look at huge utility bills and portraits of soldiers getting killed
5849807 dan kan ik het dus rustig nog een keer doen
5849808 i think we need to eliminate special use permits altogether and just ban inside the 3 mile radius
5849809 that would simplify everything for everyone here it would simplify everything for all the developers
5849810 its not clear what the university can do or cant do
5849811 i think thats not going to be anything that we can clear up in the time weve been allotted so i think we need to move forward
5849812 to have one more bill go up is just more than they can handle
5849813 verbally they seemed to be very accommodating because they recognize that was their fault
5849814 sage grouse mule deer antelope and other sagebrush dependent species
5849815 if you approve the application you are entitled to come to the zoning office and building permits are issued and they are allowed to start construction
5849816 in this case we approved it with 18 or 19 different conditions most of the conditions related to specific approval criteria
5849817 for example one of them is that they need to provide a de commissioning plan so if a product is no longer in use or they go bankrupt or something we have provisions in place where we can dismantle all of those towers that are sitting out there
5849818 its possible that while they have constructed the lay down yard and are running trucks up in tazewell county while pouring foundations and building towers in logan county that the opposition group files an appeal and challenges our decision which case is now in court and is a brand new hearing
5849819 its also possible that the judge might find that we are in error they had not met the criteria and they could overturn and throw out our local approval
5849820 in which case we have no conditional use of approval granted weve got towers that are under construction we have a lay down yard that is built
5849821 it has to be reviewed by legal counsel and approved by the county board
5849822 we would need to adjust the road use agreement accordingly to make sure the roads will be repaired
5849823 they are in the process of setting up an escrow account and performance bonds

5849837 what our experiment showed is that this shift in perspective having this distance from yourself allows you to relive the experience and focus on why youre feeling upset
5849838 they were more likely to initiate a conversation after having perceived themselves as more changed
5849839 we think that feeling you have changed frees you up to behave as if you have you think wow ive really made some progress and it gives you some real momentum

5849845 we hope that our installations will bring about a net cooling of the area
5849846 if the meltdown is not stopped we hope that it will at least be slowed down
5849847 if you are trying to cool a glacier wind screens are a crazy idea
5849848 these are the main factors and that is why the covers are so effective
5849849 when the shelling started the georgian troops would wait until the south ossetians would retreat to their basements as they have done for years during similar attacks and then the georgian army regulars would throw grenades into the basements of the houses or open fire on the civilians crowded inside their tiny basements
5849850 we thought it was the answer to a mystery thats been going on for too long
5849851 with the quickness a little tale of young black love hardcore style
5849852 mobileme was an upgrade not something new so that is particularly telling
5849853 i grew up with my dad im an only child my father was a cowboy and he really loved me very much but i think he wanted a son occasionally
5849854 im angry it makes me feel like a non person
5849855 i saw him at christmas and birthdays and he provided money for school clothes and he called occasionally
5849856 the fact that weve never been recognised and then cindy has to put such a fine point on it by saying something thats not true
5849857 we must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people especially children to be victims
5849858 i see this man pulling this long gun from under his shirt and he started shooting i just couldnt believe it some people thought it was firecrackers but i knew different i saw the little girl rubbing her leg and the boy with blood coming out of his head
5849859 opposes juvenile curfews because theyre essentially a violation of fundamental rights of innocent people
5849860 curfews essentially are placing an entire demographic in this case youth under house arrest for the inappropriate actions of a few
5849861 we need to keep the young people off the streets
5849862 and the parents need help the law is the law
5849863 this dude pulled a gun on me last week to take my bike we are moving to atlanta the whole family
5849864 and the mothers are always looking to have fun they dont make time to look after their young ones
5849865 the children cant stay in their homes because of what their mothers are doing behind the bedroom door they are having sex the boys especially have a big problem with that every kid i know who is in trouble its always the same story they cant handle their mothers boyfriends
5849866 i hope it works but i think its going to cause a lot of trouble a lot of kids are going to end up being locked up i bet you
5849867 i just cant be there thats all they cant coop us up like that its not right
5849868 i really dont care about it i will still be outside anyways
5849869 users need to be careful about overheating of the machines
5849870 our ministry told apple to improve its technological development and probe the cause of the incidents so that similar incidents do not happen again
5849871 he was just looking out to see what was going on when they opened fire and he was hit three times there was no reason for this he wasnt doing anything
5849872 they looted the main shop and then started shooting people
5849873 he had gone to see if he could find any food it was a risky thing to do maybe he shouldnt have gone out but he had to feed his family they killed him because he was a georgian and a young man
5849874 they came in two cars usually a military jeep at the front and a minibus at the back its usually young guys in their early 20s they behave like theyre on a hunting trip
5849875 she doesnt have friends or relatives here but well find somewhere for her to stay
5849876 i am an old man this is all i had all the pictures of my family everything had gone now i have nowhere to live who will look after me
5849877 the russians invaded so they have to take responsibility for what happened on occupied territory this is another srebrenica
5849878 is whether public opinion will be reinforced in its feeling of the uselessness of the french presence in afghanistan or whether the public will rally round their soldiers in difficulty and become more favourable to it
5849879 if the west swallows the pill and forgives russia the georgian war the invasion of peacekeeping tanks into ukraine will just be a matter of time
5849880 how do you prevent the russian ships from coming in
5849881 i dont know of any way to do so if we continue to stick to the point of view of not letting them in this will mean a war between ukraine and russia
5849882 there can be no business as usual under present circumstances
5849883 the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honour the words of president dmitry medvedev to abide by the six point peace plan which is not happening at the moment
5849884 considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5849885 full respect for the principles of georgias independence sovereignty and territorial integrity
5849886 im not much of a small talker and i dont think she is either i was a little nervous because i hadnt seen or talked to her in 14 years everyone was making it out to be such a big deal that i think we both fell prey to having that affect us
5849887 they started off kind of tentative but by the time we were five takes in they were giggling and seemed to be reconnecting

5849890 as an organization we have chosen to embrace an environment of accessibility despite the additional time and expense involved
5849891 our goal is to make sure that our flooring information is available to everyone
5849892 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
5849893 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
5849894 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5849895 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
5849896 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
5849897 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
5849898 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
5849899 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
5849900 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
5849901 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
5849902 we had just pulled up to the dock and some kids came over and said hey weve got a fish over here with two mouths
5849903 it was really unusual the fish has an obvious abnormality i had never seen anything like that myself before i cant speculate on what might have caused it
5849904 it was important for the fish to be displayed at the conference to show people what we have been claiming all along
5849905 people were in disbelief here they saw a fish that we suspect is very much linked to tar sands development and contamination of the athabasca river our elders tell us that what happens to the animals and the fish is just a sign of what is going to happen to human life
5849906 it is very heavily represented by industry and government and we feel that it doesnt do any justice as far as accurately representing any data to the community
5849907 this is evidence and we need to ensure that is preserved
5849908 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5849909 big cats and dinosaurs if you see any of those give us a call
5849910 police have previously received reports and conducted investigations into the receipt of this kind of material
5849911 we encourage parents whose children come across any form of child exploitation images or other inappropriate material to contact their nearest police station
5849912 a decision was made for the war to start in august the war would have happened regardless of what the georgians did whether they responded to the provocations or not there would have been an invasion of georgia the goal was to destroy georgias central government defeat the georgian army and prevent georgia from joining nato
5849913 he has been calling angela merkel nicolas sarkozy and rice for months and they have all been telling him to stop worrying that the russians wont do anything and theyve basically been ignoring him
5849914 this was a heavy armoured russian column moving slowly on very rugged terrain in the highest mountain range in europe
5849915 think how many hours of preparation assembly then marching it would take for that column moving at that speed on rugged terrain to be at the kurta bridge at six in the morning if that isnt a premeditated invasion i dont know what is
5849916 tskhinvali doesnt exist its like stalingrad was after the war
5849917 any civilised country would act the same way i may remind you that on september 11 the reaction was similar american citizens were killed you know the reaction
5849918 although many australians dream of living on the coast or in the country in reality the best quality of life in australia is found in the suburbs
5849919 in the suburbs residents often have the best of all worlds with access to good schools modern hospitals and reliable jobs but also large houses fast internet connections and low crime rates
5849920 it is horrifying the incident further shows that violence in south african schools is a real problem and people especially parents are worried about it
5849921 it is an extreme situation also underlying the general problems facing our youth problems of identity confidence in the future abuse of drugs and breakdown of familys moral system
5849922 this is traumatic parents leave their children with us in schools and expect to find them in one piece
5849923 he is clearly a disturbed child it is not normal to find a child walking about masked with a painted face and with a sword
5849924 we have all seen what the chinese have done it has been fantastic
5849925 but i am not intimidated by that we can have a show that is equally as fantastic without wasting money
5849926 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre

5849941 we are excited to be working with somatic digital to further extend access to our high quality content to a wide range of specialized learners
5849942 the tragedy of hurricane katrina is that owners with pets waited until the last 24 to 48 hours and found that most shelters and hotels would not allow pets many pet owners defied evacuation orders and subsequently lost their lives because they did not want to leave their pets behind
5849943 it is particularly important that pets have a collar with an identification tag
5849944 from cnn to the bbc everyone seems to be talking about this trend of people investing in profit making websites for capital gain or income
5849945 but theres never been an easy way for amateur or professional investors to arrive at a fair value for a site theyre looking to buy sell or hold this new tool should save investors huge sums of money in valuation and due diligence checks and should open up the holding of websites to an even broader base of investors

5849953 it happens in every business you cant hold these young kids back
5849954 the fans will see players come and go within mls all the time it happens in every team
5849955 when you have that sort of money sitting on the table its difficult to hold a young kid like that back
5849956 his future now is over there we need to move on i have to find the next one
5849957 its a huge club its going to be difficult for him
5849958 its how he adapts to the scottish game where they play him and how he adapts to that structure i believe walter bought three midfielder players in the last week or so
5849959 its going to be difficult but the challenge is now up to him i think its a great story drafted out of the university of maryland came on board was rookie of the year in 2007 broke into the national team and now hes been sold for 5 million so if theres younger kids out there they should keep following that dream

5849977 if you are going to raise up an entire group you have to raise up the flagship it was important we established a strong foundation for the sport to sell it to market it and to fill the seats we did that betty jim jarrett and fern gardner were cornerstones in the development of this committee i knew i could give the toughest assignments to betty and they would get done the right way
5849978 i have great respect for betty werner and her impact on collegiate athletics
5849979 she was very passionate about making a difference and having a positive influence on student athletes
5849980 betty has done so much in establishing opportunities for young people specifically women
5849981 everyone you talk to will tell you she did it with so much love betty will be deeply missed words do not do justice in describing how wonderful she was to so many
5849982 in line with our mission we are always looking for ways to help laboratories realize efficiencies though the deployment of leading lims technologies
5849983 however a lims deployment can prove to be crippling in terms of the implementation time and costs to make the technology fit the labs business needs the affinity for affymetrix package eliminates these stumbling blocks delivers the advantages of applied best practices and can be deployed in as little as two weeks
5849984 integrations can be daunting however using nautilus lims and the labcentrix affinity package laboratories can easily integrate with affymetrix
5849985 artificial intelligence is one of the most important aspects of todays games although it is often overlooked

5849987 we are very excited to be working with a partner as strong and established as xaitment

5849989 this is a great feather in my musical cap i had a blast playing along with the track im already working to up my game next year to defend my title
5849990 mainstream music is killing itself because of all the crap it consists of
5849991 we dont care who does the homework thats mainly so you know the material well enough to pass the test you just let her call me
5849992 im 50 and i remember going gopher hunting when i was eight years old and still there are thousands of people fathers and sons daughters and grandfathers that participate in it every year
5849993 having the alumnae back to compete on the court is a tradition that we want to continue to develop
5849994 we want our former players to have a vested interest in the current drake volleyball squad its a chance for both groups to swap stories reminisce and to create new bonds we are looking forward to having the former players back on our home court
5849995 she was just like any other kid running in school carnivals there was a gap in the 800 metres age group above her and i told her to go in it
5849996 at first she was a little nervous but she blitzed them and hasnt looked back since
5849997 she started out doing the 800 but after trying the 1500 she realised she was better at that and enjoyed it more
5849998 i am more than proud when she was younger i never thought she would be where she is but watching her develop over the last three years i knew she would make it to beijing
5849999 i just thought it would be nice for the winner to take something home with them on the night
