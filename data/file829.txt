8290000 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8290001 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8290002 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8290003 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8290004 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8290005 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8290006 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8290007 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8290008 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8290009 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8290010 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8290011 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8290012 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8290013 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8290014 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8290015 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8290016 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8290017 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8290018 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8290019 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8290020 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8290021 t he most self absorbed unstable because i say so ranter ive ever encountered in the blogosphere
8290022 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8290023 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8290024 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8290025 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8290026 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8290027 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8290028 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8290029 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8290030 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8290031 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8290032 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8290033 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8290034 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8290035 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8290036 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8290037 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8290038 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8290039 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8290040 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8290041 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8290042 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8290043 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8290044 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8290045 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8290046 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8290047 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8290048 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8290049 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8290050 ive never been prouder of a democrat than i was tonight
8290051 she said it better than i ever could have everything i worked for and that she worked for would be at risk if we do anything less
8290052 we love her but its our vote if we dont trust him or dont like him
8290053 yankee go home whos leading the anti war movement congressional republicans
8290054 the press vs al gore how lazy reporting pack journalism and gop spin cost him the election
8290055 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8290056 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8290057 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8290058 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8290059 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8290060 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8290061 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8290062 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8290063 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8290064 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8290065 time is the crucial element right now in that were looking to have camelot abandoned within two to three years so were looking at what arrangement of pumping stations will work which will be most efficient in that period so the north fork pump station can be constructed very quickly and put on line very quickly
8290066 our next step internally is to meet with each of the developers go over the flows and that in essence is going to be their percentage of what theyre paying for the project
8290067 greeley and hansen is recommending one pump station but as i understand it our engineers may be recommending two pump stations
8290068 it is out of the watershed and if you had a sewer line following the river it could open the area close to the airport close to ngic close to existing businesses on 29 north
8290069 and if that was going to happen we ought to be talking about a gravity line as opposed to a pump station
8290070 in the short term if were looking to get the camelot plant abandoned were going to need a pump station or two pump stations longer term putting a gravity line to follow the river is where the service authority wants to be preferably before 2060
8290071 our job is to serve and collect the money to build whatever it is that we need to build
8290072 the board of supervisors would contract with the service authority to do the work the service authority would put in a bid for the contract and collect the lump sum which would include hook up fees they then would then and assess a levy on the property owners that were affected
8290073 to lose 500 million gallons of water in a year something is just not right
8290074 whenever you privatize something you lose some control especially controlling the sewer rates
8290075 as long as the money thats coming from it is going to a good cause id be fine with it
8290076 i think any time scholarships are available other kinds of funding besides federal funding its great
8290077 the most important thing a person possesses is their imagination

8290080 eva wieselgren a journalist in sweden originally presented the findings of a study by bluetest earlier this week which confirmed that the iphone 3gs antenna and its 3g reception were functioning normally when readers complained that the tests didnt properly single out a problematic phone wieselgren asked for volunteers who owned a bad iphone 3g to offer their unit for additional testing
8290081 despite the wide visibility of the report wieselgren wrote that there were unexpectedly few who responded to claim ownership of a bad iphone but two users were identified who had experienced few or no bars of 3g service in areas where other mobile phones reported lots of bars of signal strength
8290082 wieselgren reported that the lab found that all these iphones to have no problems with the 3g communication in the test chamber
8290083 the lab findings refute the speculation of financial analyst richard windsor of nomura securities who issued a report two weeks ago that accused the iphone 3gs infineon chipset of being faulty and possibly requiring a massive recall to resolve infineon said it was not aware of any problems with its chips which are also used by samsung
8290084 a broader informal study conducted by wired that involved 2 600 users in different countries suggested that the iphone 3gs problems were more likely due to limitations of carriers networks particularly at amp t in the us where users reported 75 percent of the zero data results from dropped calls and less than half of the average data throughput compared to users on european carriers
8290085 cant get overly excited by a down in the situation right now because this process does go up and down
8290086 its a residential area and main road for a local school despite the tragic outcome of one person deceased were very lucky no other person was affected
8290087 when youre working with someone on a regular basis and you say to them well you go and fly and do some circuits now and they dont come back its absolutely devastating
8290088 if air france klm would like to collaborate with the new alitalia we would be pleased
8290089 supporting offshore drilling in santa barbara is like drilling in the arctic wilderness
8290090 santa barbara is a symbol for the country and the world on the dangers that can occur with offshore oil drilling
8290091 the problem is were addicted to oil and this addiction is slowly poisoning us all more pollution more global warming and more economic instability
8290092 more oil is not the answer it is the problem

8290108 if youve been thinking about starting a twitter account under the pretense of being someone else you might want to think twice if it has anything to do with someone elses intellectual property
8290109 id rather resolve this issue without getting marvels legal department involved because we are a very small start up and lack a legal department
8290110 this is a long standing conflict which has caused a great deal of tension and suffering in the region
8290111 these people have a different culture a different language and a different way of life over half of them are immigrants with religious and cultural traditions which differ dramatically from their oppressors they have a right to their independence
8290112 the responsible thing is for the international community to follow russias lead and recognize the independence of these sovereign states
8290113 it is internationally recognized that if a people express their will to have an independent existence any other state in the world has the right to recognize this independence whether you like it or not
8290114 the territorial integrity and borders of these sovereign states must be respected just as those of russia or any other country russias action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations
8290115 the american black film festivals awards continue to celebrate and honor independent films and filmmakers as well as help fulfill our vision to provide new opportunities for emerging talent and introduce their work to a broad audience

8290117 gsc pass rate is an improbable 98 4 trying to suggest that this is the result of hardwork and excellent teaching is equally improbable most knowledgeable commentators working in education know this to be true this is not to detract from the effort of many students but the sad fact is that the examinations have become a lot more predictable and therefore easier whereas 20 years ago in a modern history exam you had to study 200 years of history and could be asked questions across a wide range now you know that there will always be a question on the origin of the first world war etc makes the revision easier to target and the result predictable
8290118 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because our predecessors were thick does anybody really think that they didnt get what we had because they didnt have the talent or the strength or the endurance or the commitment

8290120 ping pong was invented on the dining tables of england in the 19th century and called whiff whaff that is the difference between us and the rest of the world we looked at a dining table and saw an opportunity to play whiff whaff that is why london is the sporting capital of the world ping pong is coming home athletics is coming home sport is coming home
8290121 im not exactly sure what i did for those two years i know this is one of the unthinkable taboos of our society but i had discovered in myself a talent for a wonderful unrepentant laziness the kind most people never have after childhood i read a lot i always have but in those two years i gorged myself on books with a voluptuous almost erotic gluttony
8290122 but what i love most here is the potential for cultural transformation growing our own food again would reconnect us to this countrys languishing frontier spirit
8290123 creemos que tras cuatro a os de intensas negociaciones la opci n de volver a abrir las discusiones no es viable dudamos que esto sea aceptado por la comisi n europea

8290126 siempre nos resistimos a esto pensamos que es un problema porque quiebra la tradicional solidaridad de las naciones acp y de la solidaridad surge la fuerza especialmente en las negociaciones
8290127 esto fue contrario al esp ritu de sucesivos acuerdos internacionales en los que se plante que deb a existir un tratamiento diferencial para los pa ses en desarrollo en el comercio y las relaciones econ micas internacionales
8290128 si se suma el producto interno bruto de todas las naciones de la regi n la cifra resultante ser menor que los activos de un gran banco europeo no es dif cil imaginar lo desiguales que fueron las negociaciones obtuvieron lo que quisieron porque son una gran potencia y siempre pueden amenazar con impedir nuestro acceso a su mercado
8290129 basado en el asesoramiento que hemos estado recibiendo de diversos sectores nosotros como miembros de la comunidad del caribe estamos ahora en una mejor posici n para tomarnos algo m s de tiempo y revisar el valor real de los epa para la regi n

8290140 the board will be objective in meeting the needs of both the old and new residents as this town belongs to everyone that calls ancram their home
8290141 there are still several tasks to which i would have liked to contribute
8290142 the momentum process and protocol that have evolved almost assuredly do not seem to embrace those challenges

8290148 the goals of hypermiling are positive such as eliminating aggressive driving and saving energy
8290149 we are grateful to the board of regents for its ongoing acknowledgment through the approval of these new programs that macon state is fulfilling its mission
8290150 the more access we give central georgia residents to bachelors degrees that benefit them professionally and personally the more this region prospers economically
8290151 we developed this program with strong encouragement and support of the areas hospitals and from coarc the committee on accreditation for respiratory care the national accrediting agency for respiratory therapy academic programs said dr
8290152 medical facilities continue to have a great need for respiratory therapists educated with advanced knowledge and skills in specialty acute care patient needs gained through baccalaureate level education
8290153 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8290154 when they talk about our country it is not with distrust or disdain but with respect and affection they do not resent or resist americas democratic influence in the world they thank god for it
8290155 over the past few months our production has doubled and our customers are coming back
8290156 the taleban would have hanged us if they had known about it but we continued producing although at a lower rate when they were around
8290157 it was when afghanistan opened its doors to foreign products and prices fell that we had to close down most of our distilleries
8290158 the government was not trying to give our business a boost but in any case it was a great help to us
8290159 we produce about ten litres of alcohol from each barrel
8290160 we package it in plastic bags and sell it to shops
8290161 afghanistans vodka is the best but now people are used to these foreign bottles we have to imitate them to make more money
8290162 the quality of our vodka is much higher than the foreign one we were producing and drinking it when there was no foreign alcohol in afghanistan
8290163 it makes no difference to us we make twice as much in profits
8290164 this is nothing new alcohol production has a very long history in afghanistan these problems will continue as long as societies exist and our struggle against them will also continue
8290165 we have recently learned that there are such establishments in the province
8290166 it is against the law and we have a specific plan to shut them down but they are very artful
8290167 now we will begin to battle these domestic producers and we will stop them
8290168 when we go on picnics on fridays we always take a bottle or two
8290169 every day i pick up one or two passengers who are drunk it was never like this in the past drinking alcohol is very common now there are no parties without vodka
8290170 this is not a good thing young people should know that it is contrary to islam
8290171 if not he leaves the world a sinner and he will be punished in the afterlife
8290172 there is a difference of opinion among religious scholars as to the punishment for the producer and user of alcohol
8290173 it is not like murder or adultery the punishment is not specified
8290174 i produce my own vodka which is unique in all the world
8290175 i dont care about the high price of imported alcohol or the restrictions on production and use i make it because its delicious i set aside the best grapes and produce enough alcohol to last a year the taste of this homemade vodka is better than the best european alcohol
8290176 the caucasus is the kind of place where when the guns start firing its hard to stop them that is the brutal reality of south ossetia

8290225 hair loss is no laughing matter and a bad or patchy hair transplant can have serious repercussions
8290226 the results of hair plug restoration techniques of yesteryear are not always pretty senator bidens procedure was very obvious back then and is still evident to the naked eye today which is not reflective of todays hair restoration capabilities
8290227 in contrast there are many men including politicians who have had successful procedures i just returned from a hair restoration workshop in italy where prime minister silvio berlusconi has had great results with new hair restoration procedures

8290286 at the end of the day if you believe abortion is wrong then youve got to take seriously a political message that says were going to work to reduce that compared to a political message from the republican party thats actually not going to do that
8290287 what these guys are saying about reducing the number of abortions is all wrong
8290288 when they the midwives go out to see the patient they are actually documenting all of the activity all of the treatments and examinations on paper so they have to write it all up in addition to that when youre carrying around lots of paper in your car theres a risk that it can potentially be lost
8290289 if the handwriting isnt clear it can compromise patient care
8290290 this way you can see the lab results and make decisions about whether a patient needs to be admitted or if the right treatment protocols are in place
8290291 in the interests of data security safety and so on we need to make sure the laptop itself isnt holding any patient data the midwives cant really do anything with the laptop but enter the data so weve made sure all the usb ports are locked down weve stripped down the install of microsoft vista on it so it doesnt really have any real functionality to it besides logging into our hospital system
8290292 we did look at smaller form units but the problem is once the screen size drops below about eight inches the meditech interface is not like a windowsy interface its more like a dos interface so it becomes very difficult to enter the data into it
8290293 though i suppose if this project was kicking off now id go for the new acer and new asus devices my technicians use the new asus eee pcs now and that would have been even better because thats an 8 9 inch screen and theyre extremely lightweight and they support 3g and they also support sd so those would have worked
8290294 the whole overall solution of 75 laptops connections etc cost about 80k a lot of its hardware cost i wish id had the eee pcs earlier because i could have saved some of that because theyre only about 190 these days but thats technology isnt it the laptops we bought last week are probably 20 cheaper this week
8290295 as with any new change you have to be measuring that change very carefully thats why we decided wed only do eight and weve picked the eight who are more keen on technology than the rest of them and well try to use them as champions to sell it to everybody else in the team

8290306 there are still russian troops in georgia proper and this is after they signed a peace agreement saying they would pull out all their troops
8290307 they really have behaved in a way that is quite wrong and will i believe turn out to be counterproductive
8290308 if european countries come together and send out a tough message then i think it will be listened to we should be sending out a very clear message of support to georgia at this time
8290309 they cannot behave in a way that they invade a neighbouring country completely against international law and get away with it the lesson we have to learn is that if we are weak in our response they will continue with their aggression

8290332 la preocupaci n es sobre los mecanismos de control de contenidos que pueda aplicar el gobierno si s lo se tiene un solo punto de interconexi n
8290333 qu garant a hay de que no exista un control de la sociedad y que este punto de acceso a la red no va afectar el acceso a determinado tipo de informaciones
8290334 tiene que demostrar el estado la necesidad de hacer esa reserva sobre los medios radioel ctricos y las telecomunicaciones
8290335 lo que hay es una extensi n de las atribuciones del ejecutivo y sin ning n tipo de control institucional son decisiones unilaterales

8290376 extracting oil from algae to produce a more sustainable biofuel is one of the most promising and exciting areas of biofuels research today
8290377 algae have significant potential as a clean renewable and economical fuel source and because algae are not used as food they are a biofuel source that does not compete with the food supply
8290378 algal oil which yields much higher energy density while requiring less land and water than other biodiesel represents the third generation

8290380 parenting associated with less aggression in early maturing teen girls
8290381 one fourth of the girls had matured early defined as beginning their period one year before the average age for females of their racial and ethnic group
8290382 early maturation only predicted physical aggression when combined with low maternal nurturance
8290383 parental nurturance may decrease girls susceptibility to negative peer influence by listening to their daughters difficulties and providing support and encouragement nurturing parents can help them develop better coping skills and diffuse negative emotions that might otherwise manifest as aggression
8290384 i am comfortable with the current policy i believe we need to give the second half of 2008 a little time to see if the scenario that i personally am counting on plays out more or less according to plan
8290385 many markets continue to be strained it seems to me that we have to continue to be very vigilant about the status of the financial markets and their potential negative impact on the general economy
8290386 the banking system is experiencing a lot of strain and some banks are in very difficult circumstances we continue to monitor banks in this particular part of the country and a number of them are facing liquidity strains and strains
8290387 i think the stabilization of the dollar which we hope will hold the stabilization has helped and the inter play between the dollar and commodity prices might also have an influence on the dampening of those pressures
8290388 the almost 30 drop in oil prices has certainly helped and we believe it will play through to the in the second half of 2008
8290389 if overall prices do not moderate in the near term as i expect inflation expectations could become unmoored
8290390 inflation expectations may have risen modestly but not by a material degree
8290391 let me emphasize that i am mindful of todays elevated risks and am prepared at any point to change tactics to ensure inflation expectations do not become unanchored

8290401 thats the section of beach where we had a massive beach fill done in late june if theres anything floating in the water its going to come up there
8290402 remember were talking about less than 10 percent of the entire beachfront
8290403 i think mayor pagliughi is probably right somebody came by and wanted to get rid of it

8290414 at the moment we owe something to our fans but we can and we must give a lot more and thats what we are working on
8290415 i have no doubt in my mind that tottenham are capable of beating any team and on sunday we are going for the three points
8290416 chelsea are a great team but we also have a very solid base the lads are working well and we have to forget about our anxieties and simply do what we have shown we are all capable of doing footballers and coaching staff alike
8290417 we didnt deserve to win but we were in shape to win in both games
8290418 we didnt but we dont have to panic nothing changes because the quality is still here although obviously its not a good situation
8290419 we now need to focus on chelsea and this week has been about reinforcing the positive things and not being negative

8290423 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8290424 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8290425 it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed and to recent russian statements
8290426 it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories
8290427 regrettable and we reaffirm our attachment to georgias territorial integrity
8290428 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8290429 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8290430 i want to re affirm the commitment of the united kingdom to support the democratic choices of the ukrainian people
8290431 my visit is designed to send a simple message we have not forgotten our commitments to you nor shall we do so
8290432 the georgia crisis has provided a rude awakening the sight of russian tanks in a neighbouring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8290433 the old sores and divisions fester and russia is not yet reconciled to the new map of this region yesterdays unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance
8290434 it is not just the end of the post cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around europe it is also the moment when countries are required to set out where they stand on the significant issues of nationhood and international law
8290435 in nato we will stand by our commitments to existing members and there will be renewed determination that there should be no russian veto on the future direction of nato
8290436 today russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago it has made military gains in the short term but over time it will feel the economic and political losses
8290437 if she truly wants respect and influence and the benefits which flow from it then russia needs to change course
8290438 isolation is not feasible russia is too enmeshed in the world economy
8290439 it would be counter productive its economic integration is the best discipline on its politics it would only strengthen the sense of victimhood that is the fuel for intolerant nationalism
8290440 it will only be a tragedy for russia if it spends the next 20 years believing it to be the case
8290441 these are actions that seek to promote prosperity and respect for russia but they have recently been met with scorn
8290442 over georgia russia has moved from support for territorial integrity to breaking up the country in three weeks and relied entirely on military force to do so

8290507 because of the internet and increased visibility of lgbt people theres not quite as much of a dire need for stores like mine and for people to feel connected twenty years ago or even 15 years ago it used to be that bookstores were real lifelines for lesbians and for gays and feminists and people outside the mainstream thats less the case now and thats a positive thing
8290508 all the people in the cymbal line live in the same town from january up until we leave for tour in june we have rehearsals three times a week about 10 hours a week
8290509 id say the most important part is really the standard that we set ourselves to
8290510 with as much work as we put in it can start out pretty rough at the beginning of the season but after months of practice in the off season and by the time we hit every day rehearsals and the summer tour we have everything down pretty well
8290511 its actually really fun we get to be really original and come up with different visual moves that we think will look cool it might be we have this many counts well we could do this oh but what if we did this someone else chimes in with another idea and it just goes from there we get to come up with some really cool visuals and we have a lot of classics that we also use we get to change everything up every year
8290512 the person who invented the viper was guy lampe when he came up with the viper he just had a vision since 1988 weve been doing the viper with four and five people
8290513 when we practice the viper we practice with the utmost seriousness at some times we may be joking around but when it comes to practicing the viper were straight faces all the way unfortunately if we mess up or if somebody misses a count somebody could get hurt so we make sure when we practice the viper were always 100 percent serious no one has gotten injured so far so knock on wood
8290514 there are still russian troops in georgia proper and this is after they signed a peace agreement saying they would pull out all their troops
8290515 they really have behaved in a way that is quite wrong and will i believe turn out to be counterproductive
8290516 if european countries come together and send out a tough message then i think it will be listened to we should be sending out a very clear message of support to georgia at this time
8290517 they cannot behave in a way that they invade a neighbouring country completely against international law and get away with it the lesson we have to learn is that if we are weak in our response they will continue with their aggression
8290518 my loathings are simple stupidity oppression crime cruelty soft music
8290519 they say that our aggression our toughness came out of our slave situation
8290520 considering that jamaica had more slavery rebellion than any country in the world
8290521 its not a question of genetic pool but we have that
8290522 its a cultural thing too that we want to achieve
8290523 i think that he knows full well that his athletes have been using drugs
8290524 he set out to set up a lab to cheat they caught him he went to prison and now hes casting aspersions on other people who have stayed in this sport the last 40 years and have been clean
8290525 from 1948 until now we have been coming to the olympics in sprints ok and we have done well this is just a culmination of what has gone on for more than 40 years
8290526 once upon a time they were saying we have it because we have fast fibers
8290527 so i said to them how many countries have fast fibers only a few areas in the world ah these are theories that dont hold strong when you have a complex situation
8290528 you remember a guy from chariots of fire who believed in god so strongly
8290529 our athletes are strong believers in the almighty they believe that without the almighty they can do nothing and with the almighty they actually can do everything
8290530 we know that our athletes have trained hard that the country would not tolerate any kind of cheating because we are a moral christian country
8290531 my job demanded a lot and i gave it 100 percent

8290558 i blamed everything on my parents or thinking i was at a horrible school
8290559 because mental illness was not on someones radar screen and because there was so much stigma to people looking in i was probably selfish reckless and moody the reality was that i was suffering inside i wouldnt wish it on anyone
8290560 if you go break your leg and run into the doctor the doctor will put a cast on it and give you medicine for it

8290563 you must wait until they meet the criteria for hospitalization in most states they have to become so gravely disabled that their life is in danger
8290564 and then you have to call the police or you have to call the crisis team at the hospital to come into your house and take your family member to the hospital and i want to tell you that its one of the most traumatic events that will ever happen to you
8290565 families say this is the only illness in the world where you dont get a covered dish people dont call dont inquire the cultural understanding of mental illness is either that its their fault for getting ill or its the fault of their family
8290566 they come to blame themselves they think its their fault that this person is mentally ill

8290642 also patients with low testosterone and type 2 diabetes have been shown to have very high concentrations of c reactive protein
8290643 which increases their risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart disease above and beyond the risk associated with diabetes
8290644 while obesity contributes to the association of type 2 diabetes and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism hh the association is not dependent entirely on obesity
8290645 in our first study of diabetic men we found that 31 percent of lean type 2 diabetics also had hh so it is likely that factors other than obesity contribute to hh possibly insulin resistance
8290646 whether obesity or insulin resistance is the major determinant of hh has to be addressed in future studies and the pathogenesis of hh needs to be defined

8290651 cricket is australias favourite game and i am so honoured to be able to turn my passion for the sport into a professional career
8290652 i personally look forward to emulating sir donald in leaving the game in better shape for having been a part of it
8290653 it is important we protect the brand of the club and protect our sponsors until the investigation is finalised
8290654 we are a big supporter of the nrl and have been a part of the nrl for some time
8290655 we talk to our staff and clients about respect and integrity and we cant afford to have anything tarnish that our brand and image are everything quality and respect its hard to keep talking to staff and clients about this if we dont stand by it
8290656 im having trouble keeping this on track this has created a real problem for us this isnt particularly healthy
8290657 a number of our staff and clients are asking whether we are reviewing the sponsorship and our commitment to the sharks
8290658 i can confirm pkf have suggested we meet to discuss our ongoing sponsorship
8290659 i understand they have concerns its important to remember that there are legal proceedings to follow and a police investigation is currently under way i would like to think pkf would continue to support the club until at the very least the matter is finalised
8290660 we are a leading accountancy firm we cant stand by when these things happen
8290661 this provides us with a real issue we are very conscious of our image and there is certainly a question mark over our investment with cronulla

8290663 commit your works to the lord and your plans will be established
8290664 all australians appreciate the manner in which sir donald lifted the nations spirit as it struggled through tough times

8290703 its come as a bit of a surprise to be honest its been sore but i didnt think it was broken
8290704 i did it some stage during the second half against the dogs
8290705 the disappointing thing is that after the season weve had its happened now right when we have put ourselves back in the hunt but im confident the boys can get the job done without me
8290706 he is a confident kid who has been playing really well at six for us
8290707 defensively he is very good and the rest of the boys have a lot of confidence in him so i dont have any problem with him there
8290708 losing finchy is disappointing but you just have to get on with it he doesnt need to have surgery so he is some chance of playing next week
8290709 he had a bit to say at training this morning which was really positive and i expect him to really take charge with finchy not there
8290710 i think the thing freddy has to do is find a way to freshen mitchell up that doesnt include a week off because he cant afford to
8290711 every game is way too important to give him a break and you just have to have your best side out there at this time of the season its really tough for him because his forwards are struggling and everything he is doing is coming off the back foot
8290712 it was the jumper i wore when i first came into first grade 16 seasons ago
8290713 when i played in the second rower i had some greats years in a great manly side particularly playing near cliffy lyons i played about 12 seasons in the eleven jumper
8290714 i just thought it would be nice to play in the number 11 again for my final premiership match at brookie
8290715 i hope a big crowd turns up to see the match and hopefully a win which would push us one step closer to the minor premiership
8290716 we want to make beavers final premiership match at brookvale as big as we can
8290717 it will be his 345th first grade game and if beaver scores a try you will hear the roar at the barrenjoey lighthouse
8290718 someone asked how he was and mick leary football club chief executive said he was having an mri scan
8290719 his name was brought up in as far as he was having an mri nothing else
8290720 it was just an ordinary board meeting and there was nothing contentious to mention
8290721 as far as im concerned he pritchard has a two year deal with the club
8290722 we took danny down to st george for a trial and i thought he played pretty good but he only lasted 10 minutes
8290723 i later found out he was the first player off
8290724 and brian smith you were the coach and selector that day
8290725 i was thinking today if it meant that bedsy got his premiership ring im resting a little easier because it would have been a travesty if he missed his chance
8290726 ive sat here all day hearing how tough he is
8290727 i wanted to go for the 2 50 rolls of toilet paper and he said no i cant have perfumed toilet paper
8290728 apparently its too tough on the cheeks of the worlds toughest player
8290729 hes the only person i know who pronounces his own name wrong
8290730 i was never the fastest or most skilful player all i set out to do was have a dig look where its got me
8290731 it was quite surprising to get the call but obviously i didnt hesitate to accept
8290732 you can sense theres a real change in the atmosphere of the wallabies this year a more relaxed feeling and you can see that in the way they play
8290733 the burdens have lifted off the players and they are enjoying their rugby theres no baggage
8290734 there were some people who didnt like to hear what needed to be said at the time
8290735 its been pleasing to see the wallabies being so successful this year under robbie deans and his direction to run the footy and to let guys back themselves ive always thought these guys were the dark horses for the tri nations and their win at the weekend confirmed that
8290736 no one can say she didnt ask her folks to come across and join no one can say she didnt endorse him no one can say she didnt criticize mccain or say it was important to beat him in november
8290737 but it was more about hillary rodham clinton talking to her supporters about her cause and what they have done and what they have accomplished
8290738 i think she realizes its a possibility that she will never be president of the united states and if barack obama wins the presidency she will be a senator for the rest of her life and have to work with him but there is also a real possibility that baracks going to lose and a real possibility that she could be the nominee in 2012
8290739 i think shes going to do what she has to do and should do as a good and loyal democrat but i dont think its going to be like someone whos really a true believer of barack obamas

8290803 la respuesta es un grosero error de pol tica exterior los jefes de estado no le contestan a los analistas econ micos de otros estados si necesita contestar que lo haga con cifras y no con agresiones y menos a espa a podr a haber dicho que quienes elaboraron el informe sobre el nivel de riesgo de la econom a argentina son malos analistas y punto
8290804 estamos ante otra muestra de la pol tica de asilamiento total del kirchnerismo

8290810 cada vez que cualquier agencia de un gobierno realiza alguna acci n se reacciona en contra del estado no se entiende que en espa a el banco central es una entidad aut rquica y que el gobierno espa ol no interfiere en sus decisiones como si pasa en la argentina
8290811 una vez m s el gobierno demuestra que se pelea hasta con sus aliados
8290812 la idea presidencial de que el informe tiene poco que ver con un an lisis de la econom a argentina

8290917 its easy to look back on michigan and say that we will have a good run at california because of how well we ran there a couple weeks ago and i certainly hope that is true
8290918 this weekend should be pretty good for our team we didnt have the best race here in february but since have done a lot of testing and have come a long way with this new car
8290919 no not really i never really even pay attention to stats and stuff like that until it comes time to go to the race and somebody will bring it up i dont know it seems like history is always a good judgment or good marker of how youre gonna run when you go back the tracks you dont have a good history at you tend to struggle at and the ones that you run well at you seem to have good stats
8290920 i dont think its any different than usual i think the media does a really good job of making it seem like were focusing on next year but all of these teams show up at the track every week trying to sit on the pole and trying to win the race maybe if youre trying to get in the chase you dont take a chance but i think you should race the same way no matter what i feel you should have the same mental outlook on all those and you should call your races the same way
8290921 i dont think so because we were somewhere a few weeks ago and were really close on whether or not wed make it on fuel but we couldnt there was maybe a small possibility that we could but larry carter crew chief was like were not gonna make it so we didnt take a chance i think you have to race the same no matter what
8290922 i feel like in four of the last 10 weeks our cars have been top 10 cars but it seems like little things kept biting us still weve been able to put those finishes together and feel pretty good about things right now
8290923 a large proportion of mortgages offer borrowers flexibility and the research shows that many people are planning to take advantage of these benefits
8290924 it s great to see that people are quite rightly prioritising their mortgage payments ahead of other financial commitments having a smaller mortgage can mean you get a better deal when you remortgage and of course reduces future monthly outgoings

8290928 the goal of our world leading chemicals management plan is to protect the health of canadians from potentially harmful substances
8290929 by identifying four substances that are potentially toxic to human health in this latest batch of substances the government is continuing to deliver results for canadians and meet the commitments we established when the chemicals management plan was launched in 2006
8290930 this is another example of how our government through the chemicals management plan is taking real action to reduce the presence of harmful chemicals in our environment and protecting it for future generations
8290931 we are greatly encouraged by our findings because the nearly half of the children on the diet were either able to maintain healthy cholesterol or gradually metabolized the extra fat and returned to somewhat normal cholesterol levels

8290938 medicaid is designed to be fiscally unsustainable but politically self sustaining
8290939 as arizona goes so goes the nation how medicaid ruins the states fiscal health
8290940 high prices for generic drugs are caused by misguided public policies that shield retail pharmacies and generic drug manufacturers from the competitive market forces that would put downward pressure on the price of generic drugs
8290941 most public drug programs reimburse the cost of generic drugs at a fixed percentage of the brand name original drug under fixed percentage reimbursement there is no incentive for retailers to compete by offering the lowest prices
8290942 canadas fixed price public reimbursement system results in a virtual monopoly within particular retail pharmacy chains for a particular generic label
8290943 if public drug benefit programs only partially reimbursed consumers directly at a flat percentage of the price of the prescribed drug all drug sales would be subject to market forces which would put further downward pressure on prices
8290944 determined by the level of retail competition and price sensitivities of consumers the resulting competition between retailers would drive prices down over time

8290963 if the writer is a socially privileged person particularly a white or a male or both his imagination may have to make an intense and conscious effort to realize that people who dont share his privileged status may read his work and will not share with him many attitudes and opinions that he has been allowed to believe or pretend are shared by everybody since the belief in a privileged view of reality is no longer tenable outside privileged circles and often not even within them fiction written from such an assumption will make sense only to a decreasing and increasingly reactionary audience many women writing today however still choose the male viewpoint finding it easier to do so than to write from the knowledge that feminine experience of reality is flatly denied by many potential readers including the majority of critics and professors of literature and may rouse defensive hostility and contempt the choice then would seem to be between collusion and subversion but theres no use pretending that you can get away without making a choice not to choose these days is a choice made all fiction has ethical political and social weight and sometimes the works that weigh the heaviest are those apparently fluffy or escapist fictions whose authors declare themselves above politics just entertainers and so on

8291026 in democracy anyone can join politics and launch a party ultimately the people will decide based on your policies and programmes the tdp is always with the people tyring to understand and solve their problems
8291027 he has not stated his partys stand on issues like federalism indo us nuclear deal communal politics and the need for forging a third alternative

8291354 we did more a precise meta analysis that shows its effective only 72 percent of the time and even that number is optimistic
8291355 follow through on his promise to reduce the number of abortions
8291356 surely we cannot be pleased with millions of terminated pregnancies
8291357 something within us must be calling for a better way if we do not resist at this point at what point will we resist
8291358 bishop blake was crystal clear in condemning abortion there was nothing subtle about it he identified himself as a pro life democrat and blatantly challenged his partys historic position on abortion
8291359 he also challenged barack obama to pursue his promise to reduce abortions and to ensure viable alternatives just this one moment is a significant turn for the democratic party
8291360 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
8291361 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
8291362 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
8291363 and if the fundamental question of when human life and human rights begin is above the capability of obama to answer it apparently is above the ability of pelosi as well
8291364 senator obama saying the question of when life begins is above his pay grade whether youre looking at it scientifically or theologically if he were to come to you and say help me out here madame speaker when does life begin what would you tell him
8291365 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8291366 and senator st augustine said at three months we dont know
8291367 the point is it that it shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to chose
8291368 tell that to parents looking at sonograms look its obviously alive
8291369 its the blind leading the blind in that party if the ardent practicing catholic doesnt care when life begins only that women have the choice to do what they choose sometimes thanks to people like pelosi not aware of what their choices actually are whether its life or not
8291370 brokaw should have asked her about infanticide obama and the born alive act but her answer may have been even more terrifying
8291371 the catholic church at the moment feels very strongly that it begins at the point of conception
8291372 and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that
8291373 scolari identified two targets when we appointed him as manager one was deco and the other was robinho everyone has seen the impact that deco has had on the premier league
8291374 during the interview mccain said there is no question that human life begins at conception
8291375 here was a candidate for the presidency of the united states asked for his position on one of the central moral and legal questions of our time and this was the best he could offer
8291376 there seems to be a pattern here in my opponents approach to many hard issues
8291377 senator obamas carefully hedged answers obscure more than they explain and this was the case in his conversation with rick warren
8291378 listening to my opponent at saddleback you would never know that this is a politician who long since left behind any middle ground on the abortion issue
8291379 he is against parental notification laws and against restrictions on taxpayer funding for abortions
8291380 in the illinois senate a bipartisan majority passed legislation to prevent the horrific practice of partial birth abortion senator obama opposed that bill voting against it in committee and voting present on the senate floor
8291381 in 2002 congress unanimously passed a federal law to require medical care for babies who survive abortions living breathing babies whom senator obama described as quote previable
8291382 this merciful law was called the born alive infants protection act illinois had a version of the same law and barack obama voted against it
8291383 at saddleback he assured a reporter that hed have voted yes on that bill if it had contained language similar to the federal version of the born alive infants protection act
8291384 even though the language of both the state and federal bills was identical senator obama said people were quote lying about his record
8291385 when that record was later produced he dropped the subject but didnt withdraw the slander and now even senator obamas campaign has conceded that his claims and accusations were false
8291386 for a man who talks so often about hope senator obama doesnt offer much of it in meeting this great challenge to the conscience of america
8291387 his extreme advocacy in favor of partial birth abortion and his refusal to provide medical care for babies surviving abortion should be of grave concern to reasonable people of goodwill on both sides of this issue
8291388 there is a growing consensus in america that we need to overcome narrow partisanship on this issue for both women in need and the unborn
8291389 we need more of the compassion and moral idealism that my opponents own party at its best once stood for no one is above the law and no one is beneath its protection

8291466 he presented himself at the front counter saying he had just robbed a bookmakers with hammer
8291467 in interview he made full admissions he said he demanded money with the hammer in his hands
8291468 he said he had dropped some of the cash and got away with very little he said there was only 35 left having dropped the rest in the process of running away
8291469 you were armed with a claw hammer and you jumped onto the counter and demanded money
8291470 it must have been a terrifying incident for the manager
8291471 the simplest and most necessary truths are often the last believed
8291472 unlike pheromones which involve only one species kairomones are chemicals emitted by one species in this case pears that attract and benefit another species such as codling moths we hope that by using pear ester we can capture enough females to provide control
8291473 first we surveyed homeowners and asked why they grow the trees for fruit or shade what do they do with the fruit eat it or give it to livestock do they prune or spray
8291474 our goal is to bring codling moth populations down to a low level so the area can have clean apples this fall
8291475 the approach is an area wide urban program to improve codling moth control and to reduce the use of pesticides
8291476 nearby backyard trees where no control program is in place can serve as a continual source of codling moths thus making it even more difficult to limit damage i encouraged the audience to get their neighbors involved in the process
8291477 the codling moth granulosis virus is a naturally occurring baculovirus that makes the worms lethargic and eventually dissolves them from the inside out
8291478 baculoviruses infect only arthropods that is insects and related species while one of only a few available choices for organic farmers the baculovirus should also be of interest to those who now use chemical pesticides and want to reduce dependence on them
8291479 do we want to give the image of the tattooed person dancing on the table

8291482 if a bar owner wants to subject himself to the liability of someone getting hurt thats a liability thats up to him its intrusive to an extent on the villages part

8291484 i dont think this board or this town should walk into a business and tell them how to run their business
8291485 i feel a bit upset that i have been quoted as saying the idea of a scottish olympic team is ridiculous
8291486 if and when a scottish team was put together i would be delighted to represent scotland in the olympic games
8291487 but before that happens so much needs to be done for the athletes to be able to compete at the highest level
8291488 as a cyclist there isnt a facility in scotland where i can train throughout the year and thats why i have to base myself outside scotland
8291489 i am proud to be scottish but at the same time its not feasible to think we can compete as a nation without the right facilities
8291490 worked real hard last year and we came around couldve done a little better than what we did so were looking to improve see if we can do a little better this year
8291491 i dont think too much will change just have a lot more people lot more competition people would have to work a whole lot harder
8291492 weve got at least two more years here that i know of unless something goes wrong of course weve heard that for 5 years that its going to be 3 more years so well wait and see
8291493 i wouldnt want to go play at a big school i love this been watching them play big creek owls since i was 5 6 years old dreaming of being up here

8291495 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8291496 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8291497 so long as the people do not care to exercise their freedom those who wish to tyrannize will do so for tyrants are active and ardent and will devote themselves in the name of any number of gods religious and otherwise to put shackles upon sleeping men
8291498 it is high time for me to put an end to your sitting in this place which you have dishonored by your contempt of all virtue and defiled by your practice of every vice ye are a factious crew and enemies to all good government ye are a pack of mercenary wretches and would like esau sell your country for a mess of pottage and like judas betray your god for a few pieces of money
8291499 never never never believe any war will be smooth and easy or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter the statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events

8291519 alamance county health director barry bass said that during a recent state bureau of investigation inquiry into his health department a judge ordered him to release the records of about five patients one of whom was library worker marxavi angel mart nez
8291520 the sheriff has suggested that the librarians arrest was related to her care at the health department
8291521 several doctors said that if patients become afraid to seek care infectious diseases could spread infant mortality could rise and emergency costs could increase
8291522 whether youre legal or illegal its always been assumed that your medical information is private and cant be used against you

8291524 you cannot be taking drugs and expect to have a career in the armed forces
8291525 we are reducing our rating to neutral as we are incrementally more cautious on the commercial performance of byetta following the latest update
8291526 we cannot conclude whether pancreatitis is any more an issue with byetta than other diabetes drugs however we think meaningful gains in the stock will require proof amylin lilly can jump start its growth in the second half 2008 against these latest headwinds and no negative new news from the ongoing healthcare database analysis
8291527 we are downgrading shares of amylin to sell from hold following last nights disclosure of four additional cases of mortality associated with pancreatitis in patients who were on byetta as we believe that a heightened vigilance for patient safety among primary care physicians will blunt the rate of glp 1 adoption driving byetta lars npv lower

8291573 we had b een walking across the desert when we arrived at a large dry wash and knew it must be tyson wash following the wash for a ways we came to a large outcropping of rocks on the east side of the wash it was filled with petroglyphs and we knew this must be picture rock directly across the wash there is a rocky hill on top of the hill we discovered deep mortars grinding holes there were a lot of mesquite trees in the area so undoubtedly early indians came here to camp while they gathered mesquite beans and ground them into flour from the depth of the mortars the area evidently had been used for a long time many natural depressions or tanks in the nearby rocks would hold water for drinking purposes making it an ideal camping spot
8291574 this hike took us through a wash with high walls forming a canyon it was very pretty after about a mile a trail led up out of the canyon to a large open area at the base of the mountains huge brown boulders were scattered all over this valley and almost every rock was covered with petroglyphs rock etchings from the large number of petroglyphs this must have been an active indian camp for quite a long time then we followed a path leading toward the base of the mountains here under an overhanging ledge of rock was dripping spring there was a pool of water beneath the ledge into which water was dripping from the rocks above
8291575 we drove east out of yuma on i 8 for about 70 miles then turned north on the spot road exit
8291576 a rutted track turned west from the cabin and came out by some large dark rock outcroppings
8291577 after 12 miles you will arrive at the park the first primitive camping area is only a few miles off the highway and is called the petroglyph unit the focal point is a large mound of rocks the surfaces of which are covered with ancient petroglyphs
8291578 virtually every stone was covered with etchings these petroglyphs were similar to others we had seen in the southwest man is portrayed in crude form there were also snakes and lizards animal forms jagged and spiral and designs to mention a few on the ground near this hill of rocks were large flatter rocks with mortars on them
8291579 one of the findings from our new work is that getting it so to speak is strongly correlated with trust in the news media
8291580 the more an american trusts the media to be accurate and unbiased the more likely they are to endorse mainstream scientific views about climate change
8291581 our research suggests that theres actually kind of a carry over that people dont forget that quickly
8291582 its kind of like the dog that didnt bark in sherlock holmess stories americans heard a lot skeptics in a lot of news stories for a lot years and the impact of those skeptics doesnt disappear simply because the skeptics arent being mentioned any more
8291583 if our highest quality news outlets are not drawing audience attention to important news about science or the environment

8291619 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
8291620 it is not at all surprising that the communist partys censorship agency banned coverage of demonstrations by pro tibetan groups or the existence of designated protest areas in beijing but the instructions regarding food security and the chinese teams results are astounding
8291621 we call on the international olympic committee to investigate this censorship directive which is both a violation of the commitments given in 2001 and yet another infringement of the free flow of news in china

8291633 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8291634 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8291635 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8291636 we are connecting with fans and sponsors like never before
8291637 but we want things to continue to get better to continue to grow
8291638 believe me im not happy about paying 3 80 for a gallon of gasoline and i know youre not either
8291639 i concur with that view and believe current fed policy is consistent with an easing in overall inflation given the dynamics of the economy
8291640 with weak growth and financial market strains i believe the most likely outcome is that both headline and core inflation will diminish over the rest of 2008 and into next year as the temporary effects of energy and food price increases abate
8291641 to tell a business owner that they cant express their beliefs on an issue is a really stupid thing

8291648 you can set russias recent invasion of georgia and israels concern over irans nuclear aspirations on the back burner not that these topics lack importance
8291649 the stage is not adequately set for the highly publicized ezekiel 38 and 39 russian iranian nuclear equipped consortia of nations to invade israel psalm 83 comes first and then ezekiel 38 follows on its heels like a goliath shadow there are two distinct invasions of israel one building upon the other with both occurring sequentially in the middle east

8291662 they own all or part of every single commercial cable channel
8291663 they look at the teen market as part of this massive empire that theyre colonizing you should look at it like the british empire or the french empire in the 19th century teens are like africa you know thats this range that theyre going to take over and their weaponry are films music books cds internet access clothing amusement parks sports teams thats all this weaponry they have to make money off of this market
8291664 thats all that mtv is sometimes its an explicit advertisement paid for by a company to sell a product sometimes its going to be a video for a music company there to sell music sometimes its going to be the set thats filled with trendy clothes and stuff there to sell a look that will include products on that set sometimes it will be a show about an upcoming movie paid for by the studio though you dont know it to hype a movie thats coming out from hollywood but everythings an infomercial there is no non commercial part of mtv

8291885 sono quasi imbarazzato nel darle del lei ha detto nellintroduzione alberto savorana portavoce di comunione e liberazione per quellamicizia che con don paolo ho condiviso fino adesso ci tengo a chiedergli che cosa ha generato il s di un giovane in servizio di leva allinvito di un commilitone chi avrebbe mai immaginato questo filo della storia
8291886 oggi don gius si compiace perch un suo figlio stato chiamato a collaborare affinch quel suo sogno giovanile di unit della chiesa di dio diventi realt
8291887 quando mi hanno chiesto di parlare a questo meeting ha esordito monsignor pezzi ho subito pensato a quando venticinque anni fa io montavo questo palco come volontario cera il mio amico aldo che teneva la supervisione sapeva tutto di come si doveva lavorare e io seguivo lui oggi sono a parlare da questo palco ma nella sostanza lo stesso
8291888 nella mia vita ho sempre cercato la risposta al mistero di dio ha continuato magari anche ingenuamente e incoscientemente ma ho scoperto con stupore un disegno buono sulla mia vita
8291889 dire s a cristo nellaccettare la nomina del papa come quando venticinque anni fa dicevo di s ad aldo che mi chiedeva di portargli una chiave numero cinque per montare il palco
8291890 per rispondere devo rimanere in rapporto con dio perch il s a cristo sempre un s a persone e circostanze concrete per questo mi interessava di pi il s che continuare a sognare circostanze favorevoli al mio temperamento ci che fa fiorire il deserto lofferta quotidiana perch anche la vita di tutti i giorni di un vescovo piena di cose aride ma questa unoccasione di protagonismo solo se si offre ogni cosa a cristo
8291891 gli dissi che lui rimaneva in monastero perch io potessi partire non si rimane infatti se non per partire e non si parte se non per rimanere solo rimanendo nello stupore ritrovo il gusto dellavventura della mia vita e della missione che ho imparato a gustare allinterno della fraternit san carlo borromeo e nel rapporto con don massimo camisasca
8291892 nel 1984 in occasione del trentennale del movimento ha raccontato scrissi a don giussani che ero cos grato dellesperienza vissuta da essere disposto ad andare ovunque nel mondo non avevo mai pensato alla russia se non per le affascinanti letture del samizdat partire per rimanere per me stata una condivisione di vita che oggi si riflette nellattirare uomini in un miracolo di comunione la vita si trasforma solo nellobbedienza ha aggiunto che la condizione secondo la quale tutto quello che fai esprime la comunione che affermi piegarsi alle circostanze invece che perseguire un proprio progetto
8291893 oggi ci si arresta a livello di analisi della situazione dimenticando qual la priorit e il punto di partenza per chi vive in cristo lecumenismo infatti landare verso laltro col desiderio di conoscere la verit in lui presente attraverso di me la presenza di cristo tende a diventare trasparente e questo lo posso vedere nella mia amicizia con alcuni preti ortodossi con i quali ci troviamo in incontri informali che hanno a tema leducazione di noi stessi e di chi incontriamo
8291894 tutta questa mia esperienza ha concluso il vescovo mi fa guardare con piet alle persone che incontro senza voler ingrossare le fila per me significa guardare con attenzione alla realt della russia e della sua chiesa ortodossa ricordandomi che tutti gli uomini compresi i russi sono bisognosi di cristo

8291917 the authorities had already made it public through official tv and radio that the id card of doctors or paramedics would be considered as curfew pass but the way our people have been treated is shocking
8291918 its dangerous because we dont have such an advanced surgical facility in peripheries

8291927 the history that is being made here this week would you have in most of your lifetime every thought it possible
8291928 it was really surprising and gratifying to me when barack obama carried georgia in the democratic primary against two very attractive white candidates hillary clinton and john edwards
8291929 i think this is such a historic convention i think this is kind of a turning point in what has been one of the most troubling id say embarrassments and burdens on my heart and that is the racial discrimination that still exists in a nation thats supposed to be treating all men and women are created equal i think thats why i wanted to be here
8291930 will probably be the economy again as it was when bill clinton was elected the first time between now and november i predict the oil companies will hold down oil prices a little bit to try to help the republican ticket but im afraid that by the time january comes along the economy will be the most serious problem in america
8291931 why is it that so often the democrats are so rancorous at their conventions
8291932 maybe thats the nature of democrats i remember most republican conventions its just all orchestrated ahead of time which doesnt make very good news coverage but i think one reason is that democrats have a much wider diversity of interests and its hard for them to come together under a single umbrella and that means the democratic umbrella has to be about three times as large as the republican umbrella does
8291933 we want this portal to be open we want this to be like wikipedia everyone gets to contribute equally
8291934 our analysis describes wikipedia as an organization with highly refined policies norms and a technological architecture that supports organizational ideals of consensus building and discussion
8291935 all discussions were based on political solution within a united sri lankan state
8291936 a sustained strike could affect the date of share transfer which could conceivably be put back as a result low level short term action will be unlikely to affect the date of share transfer
8291937 it is in everybodys interest that the new parent body takes over a fully functioning viable and prosperous company
8291938 in terms of the future of plants in the event of shutdown the first thing to say is that safety manning levels in all plants would be maintained extended inactivity however could weaken stakeholder confidence and short to medium term confidence
8291939 i can assure you that no statements have been made by nmp to suggest any potential impact on share transfer dates as a result of any potential industrial action
8291940 nmp continues to work towards the share transfer programme and will make no comment regarding current industrial relations issues on site that is a matter for the current sellafield management team and the unions
8291941 and at this stage we do not envisage any difficulties
8291942 there is an improvement and we are recommending members to say yes
8291943 risks of strike action in particular the lasting damage that any such action could cause in areas such as job security site investment management union relationships and stakeholder confidence
8291944 we are worried about all the plants not just any one in particular
8291945 to move into a fully operational state it is necessary to apply for a consent to operate we are in discussions with the regulators as to when to apply for the consent
8291946 well have to deal with the consequences of this having been defeated and respond its not going to be a case that were going to be deferring this and coming back
8291947 the legislation will be introduced as planned these are just excuses
8291948 the enabling legislation does not dictate the timing or the structure of the proposals and the decision runs counter to the recommendations of the auditor general who they wanted to vet the process
8291949 the legislation will be introduced and they will be required to vote on it
8291950 at no stage did the premier call mr hickey or anyone else a liar
8291951 he was in the back garden which is totally secure and surrounded by a high wall there is no way he could have got out or jumped over he has a kennel there and went missing between tuesday night and wednesday morning
8291952 i am certain he has been stolen i just want him back i will offer a reward for his safe return or any information ive been to the police but they say it is difficult for them to act without proof dexter has been stolen
8291953 he is tiny he only weighs about three and a half pounds and is milky white in colour
8291954 everyone is feeling the squeeze from inflation and high fuel costs but weve come up with the best compromise
8291955 this is a national issue and councils all over the country are finding themselves in similar situations
8291956 in 2003 4 cumbria county council received just under 400 000 through the governments rural bus challenge and urban bus challenge schemes however these schemes were reduced to 106 000 funding in 2007 8 and have now been removed all together
8291957 drug company marketing is often the only way you get information about new drugs in a timely fashion
8291958 gps receive far more information from drug companies than from independent sources the government needs to increase funding to ensure gps have better access to timely objective information
8291959 drug companies really seem to be the only ones who get out there and do it more nps attention would be wonderful
8291960 gps are bombarded with marketing and promotions from drug companies this can influence their prescribing habits and this isnt in the best interest of consumers
8291961 because the information provided isnt independent it can lead to inappropriate prescribing practices which expose consumers to unnecessary risk it can also increase the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme which is funded by taxpayers
8291962 what data like this does is allow us to actually see where the increases in pain really are versus where theyre being imagined
8291963 it seems that the suburban families have probably had a more finely tuned radar on some of these issues than the consumer price index itself
8291964 a slowing in the rate of growth doesnt mean theyre back to where they started
8291965 while these latest numbers suggest that the last years been a particularly bad one for families we have also seen in previous years that pensioners and other welfare beneficiaries were doing it pretty tough
8291966 they have certainly spiked in recent times because of factors like petrol and groceries but the increased cost impact on the ability of single aged pensioners and married couples who are pensioners to survive on the basis of the age pension has been a challenge for a long long time

8291968 uit onderzoek blijkt dat jongeren dat heel interessant vinden die oefeningen en rampenscenarios zijn spannend en ze voelen zich ergens bijhoren
8291969 als het water ineens komt en er is sprake van een grootschalige evacuatie dan weten we in nederland nog altijd niet wat we moeten doen
8291970 we hebben allerlei scenarios maar de problemen in new orleans lieten zien dat de evacuatie van een grotestadsbevolking voor ongekende problemen zorgt
8291971 die oefening beantwoordt waarschijnlijk de vraag of de burgemeester het gezag in handen houdt of dat die verantwoordelijkheid bij de commissaris van de koningin komt te liggen
8291972 we moeten verder kijken dan 2015 het water heeft dan nog meer ruimte nodig overloopgebieden waar de economische activiteit gering is de schade is daar beperkt en een nationale ramp blijft achterwege
8291973 la fecha propuesta por estados unidos para la permanencia de las tropas militares era en 2015 y la de irak era en 2010 por lo que acordaron fijarla en 2011 irak tiene el derecho si fuera necesario a extender la presencia de estas tropas

8291985 they liked it so much they are bringing us back for some encore time to beef it up
8291986 it gives us a little bit of history of the cullen family they are just shooting a couple of different added scenes and the scene im in i can tell you its me and robert pattinson rosalie and emmett are in that scene
8291987 we actually just had a rehearsal at director catherine hardwickes house the other day for a new scene

8291996 hes facing an escape charge now when it was just a five day sentence he had
8291997 campaign spending in the 2007 elections a challenge to 2010 elections
8291998 what is alarming is that no one violated airtime limits and no one overspent in the last elections if based on the legislators reports to the commission on elections comelec
8291999 the purpose of monitoring campaign finance is not merely to establish if campaign spending limits are being violated but more importantly to determine whether or not there exists a level playing field in the electoral contest
8292000 further although beyond the scope of this report understanding funding for campaigns is also critical in determining the relationships between the funders of the campaign and the political behavior of candidates
8292001 when we did compare 2007 and 2004 spending we found that 2007 spending was two and half times larger than spending in 2004 for all media for all candidates
8292002 we did not sort out exactly the sources but what we did look at what was the amount spent on political ads and how they used the money on political ads
8292003 because the project in 2007 was a pilot project we looked only on the expenditure side we didnt look at the funding side we hope in 2010 when we expand the monitoring we will include sources of funds but unfortunately for 2007 we dont have any data on the sources of funding
8292004 what we heard overwhelmingly was to do what we do best and thats help farmers improve yield
8292005 one out of seven people are still actively engaged in producing food around the world
8292006 if you can conserve more produce more and improve farmers lives thats being a leader in agriculture
8292007 we will have to learn how to feed double the amount of people on the same amount of arable land if we dont want to encroach on fragile rainforest land or grassland
8292008 the way were going to do that is unequivocally with biotechnology
8292009 theres a movement toward having organics as the standard but i think everyone in this room understands if were going to feed this growing world it has to be through biotech
8292010 the public is now willing to donate more funding to conservation planning on private lands
8292011 the nature conservancy with 1 million members in 30 countries has generated more than 20 billion for public and private conservation projects in the last 20 years its one of many non profits that are thriving in this arena
8292012 were engaged on both sides of the supply chain so we have a unique ear we can hear whats going on

8292079 we begin by validating the current list of genes and improving the gene structure models using nimblegen tiled expression arrays the experimental results better delineate transcribed regions of the genome and guide the design of a comprehensive probe set for the 12 plex
8292080 in all 40 of the designed probes reside in unannotated regions no other array can easily afford this luxury in rapid time our transcription profiling experiments detect the co regulation of all identified genes and many yet unknown genes under a large range of conditions while simultaneously improving the genome annotation
8292081 use of the nimblegen 12 plex gene expression microarray is advantageous and more accurate than other platforms because it allows to run replicates within the same array that validate analysis within the same experiment
8292082 conducting array hybridization is relatively straightforward the analysis of the results is user friendly and does not require highly specialized informatics skills
8292083 the 12x135k arrays is a powerful tool for accomplishing high throughput gene expression profiling
8292084 combined with nimblegen custom design option and high probe density these arrays allow convenient and accurate analysis of a wide range of organisms from the simplest bacterium to complex mammals and plants these arrays will accelerate functional genomics research and support our goal of providing innovative solutions for faster and more accurate results

8292258 i have been to four conventions but never in front of the delegates on the floor before
8292259 everybody cheered when they heard the candidate from their state introduced
8292260 to be showcased as one of the top candidates was pretty exciting really exciting you stood there through chris van hollens 10 minute speech and he said these candidates were picked to be here because they have done their parts in the campaign and when he says your name you step up and wave it was pretty exciting
8292261 the two hijackers were transported to one of the halls at kufrah airport after giving themselves up

8292270 ich bin in der zeit nicht richtend an ihn herangegangen
8292271 es ging ja ums dokumentieren barino war immer offen aber die anderen haben abgeblockt
8292272 ich wei nicht wie du das siehst barino ich empfand das als fundamentalistische gruppe
8292273 f r mich war das keine radikalisierung sondern eine normalisierung oder islamisierung
8292274 ich konnte damals nachvollziehen dass man zu diesem schluss kommt
8292275 denn die welt l sst sich nicht nur durch ratio begreifen sie hat mehr zu bieten
8292276 wir hatten nur vor menschen zum islam einzuladen moscheen zu unterst tzen eine islamische kindertagesst tte zu gr nden

8292299 between the two candidates i think senator obama is closer to the churchs teaching than senator mccain is
8292300 we need to talk about the lives lost in iraq war
8292301 when you compare the 4 000 soldiers who lost their lives fighting valiantly in iraq to the 4 000 babies who died today it becomes clear barack obama has admirable qualities but he advocates legal abortion for all nine months
8292302 he loved his family loved his mum loved his sister loved everybody he always had a smile on his face
8292303 i just cant put into words what this tragic loss of life has done to his family

8292353 we the undersigned believe that a healthy food system is necessary to meet the urgent challenges of our time
8292354 a clear and commonly held framework for future action to educate citizens and policy makers
8292355 this declaration is a call to action by and for all americans
8292356 the purpose of u s food and agriculture must change and it can no longer focus on the production of cheap calories conditions demand a more holistic approach to human and community health that begins on our farms and ranches
8292357 this declaration which is being crafted by a broad coalition is the preamble for the next generation of farm policy and we hope it will stimulate the discussion to help get us there
8292358 behind us stands a half century of industrial food production underwritten by cheap fossil fuels abundant land and water resources and a drive to maximize the global harvest of cheap calories
8292359 ahead lie rising energy and food costs a changing climate declining water supplies a growing population and the paradox of widespread hunger and obesity
8292360 a spectre is haunting the cities and villages of most developing nations warns a senior official of a world bank affiliated organization
8292361 its the spectre of a food fuel and water crisis says lars thunell
8292362 keeping water under local public and democratic control is the most just way to insure the greatest degree of water access for the greatest number of people
8292363 the movement to create better food and agriculture in the u s has been slowly and steadily gaining ground for well over a decade
8292364 the publics increasing interest and the medias deepening coverage of climate change energy agriculture labor issues food costs food quality and obesity may finally illuminate the interrelationship of these crises and provide a context for urgently needed changes
8292365 confirmed that a tight cadre of lobbyists control the debate to protect the status quo rather than aid the population of the nation
8292366 for a radically different approach to food and agriculture we believe that the food system must be reorganized on a foundation of health
8292367 the development of just and sustainable regional farm and food networks
8292368 most all the major organizations seeking reform in agriculture in the u s have signed on to the declaration the challenge remains to bring in more of the current mainstream

8292401 i saw a very interesting complex woman who had been reduced to saying what a good mom she was and how cute her meeting with barack was

8292430 maine residents angered by expansion of dirigo health care subsidy
8292431 the tax would not have to be approved through the past series of courtroom like hearings that cost the state an estimated 1 million to prepare for and defend each year
8292432 everything has become more expensive now including pizza for people who need to watch what they spend
8292433 in naples and elsewhere in italy that should be enough to cover costs and give a profit margin without damaging quality
8292434 my bill begins to gather data on the success of schip nationally in accomplishing its goal
8292435 knowing the program is working is the first step to ensure taxpayer dollars are being spent in a responsible way
8292436 the person who doesnt sign up for a government program has a right not to
8292437 if the government wants more people insured they need to target the reasons people arent signing up
8292438 there is definitely a move nationally to usher this type of legislation through
8292439 government regulation that drives up the cost of health insurance is a significant factor in denying health insurance to the working poor
8292440 if government were to mandate that the only car anyone could own was a lexus it wouldnt be long before the poor lacked transportation sometimes people have to drive a kia
8292441 state imposed mandates force people to pay for more insurance coverage than they want or need and in effect place a legal ban on low cost economy model insurance

8292443 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time

8292454 conventional nonsense making the case for a press boycott of the national political conventions
8292455 why im proud im not going to the 2008 conventions even though i covered them in 2004
8292456 im not sure how or if i can add any value to or interact with the convention
8292457 if the political press corps were honest theyd start every convention story with the finding that nothing important happened that day and that your attention is not needed
8292458 hopefully weve got all the injuries at the start of the season and we can get everyone back fit more or less after the international break
8292459 in a way its fallen nicely for us having only two league games in the first four or five weeks of the season when weve got a few injuries when we do have to play these games again maybe well have everyone back fit
8292460 it will be a difficult season because of the game cancelled on friday were going to tokyo for a week so well have a game cancelled there and we do have to cope with that
8292461 but i always say the best team is always at the top of the table at the end of the season and they deserve it you make your own luck
8292462 i think i maybe enjoy it more because this season i could be going into games thinking it might be the last time i play in that tournament
8292463 wanneer de boog te lang gespannen heeft gestaan verliest hij zijn veerkracht
8292464 there are still russian troops in georgia proper and this is after they signed a peace agreement saying they would pull out all their troops
8292465 they really have behaved in a way that is quite wrong and will i believe turn out to be counterproductive
8292466 if european countries come together and send out a tough message then i think it will be listened to we should be sending out a very clear message of support to georgia at this time
8292467 they cannot behave in a way that they invade a neighbouring country completely against international law and get away with it the lesson we have to learn is that if we are weak in our response they will continue with their aggression
8292468 whether you voted for me or for barack obama the time is now to unite for a single party for a single purpose
8292469 this is a fight for the future and a fight we must win together
8292470 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8292471 weve got to get going by electing barack obama the next president of the united states
8292472 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hangs in the balance

8292499 i dont know if theres anything thats before or after that sort of thing
8292500 obviously looking at that id want to look at the use of force report
8292501 my job is to maintain objectivity until the completion of an investigation what i can say is i think that that warrants additional review but i have to maintain objectivity on anything because you cant rush to judgment
8292502 its really frustrating that we have this incident of violence now
8292503 theres been hundreds of contacts with officers that have gone very well
8292504 we may have an isolated instance here and there and the department is committed to fully looking into those instances and if its deemed inappropriate well take the appropriate actions

8292521 this is about women in general i think theres going to be another movement coming a different kind of movement of women for women weve been silent for some time
8292522 i think the grave mistreatment of hillary during the primary has been an awakening for a lot of women who didnt consider themselves to be feminists in the past
8292523 millions of folks feel like the democratic party abandoned its loyal base of women in this election
8292524 we believe that once women in this country have power in government and the workplace and money things like abortion will not even be on the table for discussion
8292525 the womens movement needs to stand up and say sexism is wrong we made a mistake because we allowed it to happen and we will not do that again to women or any other group
8292526 women are like tea bags they never know how strong they are until theyre in hot water
8292527 we have to educate these women who are disappointed hillary didnt win

8292550 to jons great credit he has drawn the new generations into the political arena in a way they have not been for the last few election cycles and the country is better off for it
8292551 i think he feels he has a constituency of young people to whom he feels a responsibility and he is trying to present issues in a satirical way but in a robust and affirmative way
8292552 the class was basically like a bunch of guys sitting around on a saturday night having a beer and making funny wisecracks
8292553 to be a psychologist which he majored in at university and then switch to comedy you have to have that veneer of political awareness and he did have a passion to be funny
8292554 he made a little deal with me that i would give him two years to try and explore what he wanted to do
8292555 so he took all kinds of weird jobs just to keep himself afloat until that point he announced he wanted to go to new york to be in comedy

8292580 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver
8292581 this is the kind of question that i predict and this heas nothing to do with whats going on now but i am just saying if you look at five 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent

8292584 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone

8292596 barack obamas father was muslim and therefore according to islamic law so is the candidate in spite of the koranic verses explaining that there is no compulsion in religion a muslim child takes the religion of his or her father for muslims around the world non american muslims at any rate they can only ever see barack hussein obama as a muslim
8292597 demonstrated an incapacity or unfitness to practise medicine and is suffering from an ailment that might if the physician were permitted to practise constitute a danger to the public
8292598 there may be times when there is someone involved in that process who would be harmed or embarrassed by the release of the name and or there may be times when the actual release of the physicians name would be extremely harmful to the physician
8292599 if there is serious reason to question the competence of this doctor the patients are entitled to know if it was their doctor and that they might wish to seek a second opinion
8292600 but when you put on one side of the scale the potential health and safety of all this doctors patients i find it difficult to imagine what you would put on the other side of this scale that would justify not alerting patients to the danger that they may need to seek a second opinion
8292601 what we do is if its necessary the physician will withdraw from practice and at that point of course its obvious and the physician isnt practising and so thats our ability to say that the public is no longer at risk

8292604 when you consider that these volunteer firefighters are out there risking life and limb to protect those around them and theyre out and need a place to practise their skills and do their training to have someone to go in there and vandalize that thats sad
8292605 its just as bad as if they vandalized the fire equipment itself
8292606 the plan democrats unveiled today is just another attempt by their leadership to hide the fact that they have spent decades advocated the policies that put us on a path to 4 a gallon gasoline
8292607 republicans have a real plan that says yes to alternatives yes to more american production and yes to more conservation the only thing democrats have said yes to when it comes to energy is 4 gasoline that drills right into your wallet

8292634 i was treated like a criminal and i didnt understand why i was being treated like that
8292635 an important factor in this case is that this woman had been previously deported from this country and she ignored that order and came back
8292636 we are outraged and heartbroken for the treatment of juana at the hands of the officers who were involved we urge our communities across the state to grieve with us and respond in prayer and political action to work towards repair and reform of the immigration laws of our state and nation

8292669 somalia is really at a stage where the situation is getting increasingly acute and a cause for major concern
8292670 within the first six months of this year the number of people requiring emergency livelihood and humanitarian support increased 77 percent from 1 83 million to 3 25 million affecting 43 percent of the entire population of the country
8292671 more and more people from the rural and urban areas are falling into acute food and livelihood crisis and humanitarian emergency
8292672 as they cannot cope with the compounding shocks of conflict drought and hyperinflation many of the poor and middle households are becoming severely indebted and are adopting extreme coping strategies including reducing food consumption skipping meals splitting families selling productive assets and out migrating known locally as keynaan
8292673 threatening to plunge the country into an even greater humanitarian disaster
8292674 we went to ethiopia and hargeisa for discussions about issues of mutual concern in particular to build partnerships between british muslims and communities in both countries
8292675 we shared our experiences as british muslims in britain today and helped counter the misperceptions that existed about the role of muslims in uk society we also learned a lot from the experiences of our ethiopian and somali hosts we were proud to represent the diverse range of british muslim communities on this visit

8292682 dont do a good job of discussing the things we dont like
8292683 we have to figure out how to address peoples anxieties
8292684 what democrats have to do is understand that republicans have it right
8292685 that pursuant to previous discussions with the county commissioners the financial responsibility to fund the city county health department shall be assumed by pueblo county beginning in the year 2010
8292686 i feel its disingenuous for city council to take that action last night
8292687 this decision was made without our knowledge we did discuss it but no commissioner ever agreed or committed to that agreement
8292688 we never approved any intergovernmental agreement with the city and im wondering where that approval came from last night
8292689 im wondering how they could conceive that commissioners would go along with that

8292692 bush did the dream of democracy a huge disservice by linking it to the assertion of u s military power pressuring other countries to adopt the superficial aspects of a complex and subtle system of governance is simply not the route to follow in promoting american values or security interests yet the goal is correct and should not be abandoned only presented in a style and a tone far more sensitive to how it is perceived in other lands

8292708 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8292709 we know the parameters of the contract and the giants would have been generous
8292710 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8292711 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8292712 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8292713 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8292714 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8292715 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of

8292747 demonstrated an incapacity or unfitness to practise medicine and is suffering from an ailment that might if the physician were permitted to practise constitute a danger to the public
8292748 there may be times when there is someone involved in that process who would be harmed or embarrassed by the release of the name and or there may be times when the actual release of the physicians name would be extremely harmful to the physician
8292749 if there is serious reason to question the competence of this doctor the patients are entitled to know if it was their doctor and that they might wish to seek a second opinion
8292750 but when you put on one side of the scale the potential health and safety of all this doctors patients i find it difficult to imagine what you would put on the other side of this scale that would justify not alerting patients to the danger that they may need to seek a second opinion
8292751 what we do is if its necessary the physician will withdraw from practice and at that point of course its obvious and the physician isnt practising and so thats our ability to say that the public is no longer at risk
8292752 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8292753 this is a band aid but i think you need a bigger picture which is governments issues around the direction of health services in the province because we dont have an adequate home care system
8292754 who actually looks after the patient there do they go back to their family doctor are they looked after by the doctor who looks after patients in that home in that situation it could fragment the patients care
8292755 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8292756 i think in terms of safety we can reduce risk by having fewer hands in the pot
8292757 im responsible and my butcher is responsible and thats it
8292758 bigger establishments maybe have the ability to hire better quality control staff that can be on staff to check whats going on and they also have some pretty incredible refrigeration systems that allow them to quickly cool the meat which does extend its shelf life

8292760 we face possibly having to close this store because we cant implement their rules
8292761 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8292762 the mean brain volume in preterm infants with abnormal blood flow distribution was 45 millilitres smaller than in other preterm infants
8292763 we examined tissue samples from preterm placentas and classified them according to the amount of inflammation found in microscopic examinations inflammatory reactions were seen in 45 per cent of the placentas
8292764 a genotype causing strong inflammatory response increases the risk of placental inflammation but on the other hand protects the child against inflammation our preliminary findings suggest that genetic regulation of interleukin 6 is also associated with the volume of the deep gray matter of the brain
8292765 in order for us to create treatments that can help protect the development of the brain its essential that we systematically follow up the development of preterm infants this should always be an integral part of the care of preterm infants

8292770 i am particularly impressed with the enthusiasm expressed by indian publishers who have pledged full support by way of sponsorships
8292771 in fact i see 2009 as a turning point in indias b to b publishing industry

8292819 a bit like anything it develops and you get used to running between the wickets and communicating to the point where it will just be a simple nod rather than a call
8292820 things like that do happen over time and given the time i think fingers crossed it could be a good opening partnership
8292821 i dont think you can have defined roles because there are too many variables
8292822 we know what we want to do and we know where we want to be at the end of the powerplays and during the powerplays but on different wickets that might adjust slightly against different bowlers

8292828 ive had experience of opening the batting for sussex and if i need a boundary i know what kind of shot i need to play but its trying to make sure you get the level of risk management right

8292837 a good illustration would be somebody saying their plan worked just like they thought it would well thats not a story we want things that are unexpected we want to hear the stumbles the roadblocks and the bad luck then the good news at the end but pr people always start with the good news

8292898 this is troubling and could indicate additional pressure in future quarters

8292902 ive had group sex four couples all doing each other had sex in some public places fucked in cars a lot and done it in the movies
8292903 ive been thinking about it maybe ill do a threesome with a girl and a guy and let him do my ass while she eats me out or maybe ill just have the girls over and we can have some strap on fun

8292906 it depends during the summer im a lifeguard at a community pool if things get too hot and no ones around i will skinny dip right in the open i love my job because i get to look at half naked guys all day every now and then one of them will pretend to drown so i can save them i make sure they feel my hard nipples pressing against their chest as i pull them out of the water then i give them mouth to mouth and run my tongue along the edge of theirs then they usually get a bulge in their pants and i tell them to meet me in the mens locker room for my lunch break we sneak into one of the stalls and start going at it the other guys in the locker room try to get a peek but that just makes me put on even more of a show
8292907 thats my favorite place to fool around i sneak in after the pool closes and get naked with whoever is with me i love it when the guy swims up behind me and i can feel his boner press against my ass i let him rub it on the outside of my puss till im ready im really tight in the water so he has to work his head into my hole slowly but once its in its smooth fucking from there on out

8292911 my freshman year i felt like i had it but it still didnt make me happy
8292912 my life depended on football so much that when it was gone even the chance of not being able to have it paralyzed me with fear schweiger said
8292913 so i started to do crazy stuff the drinking and drugs and girls were an escape because i just wanted to be free from the pain when id do that stuff id be free for a minute but when i was done the pain came back twofold every time
8292914 i found that i was playing football for acceptance and fame and was motivated by fear

8292932 at aston villa it was difficult when he wasnt playing i saw him on saturday against falkirk when he played for 70 minutes and i thought he was outstanding he looked lively and bright
8292933 i spoke to shaun and he felt with a couple of games under his belt that he would be back to 100 so i had no hesitation in calling him up
8292934 he has started the season well he gives us a different dimension and hes in good goalscoring form
8292935 alan has progressed in the last few years into a top class international full back some people would say one of the best full backs in britain
8292936 its very disappointing but we were aware of his injury pre season we kept our fingers crossed that he would be available for the start of the campaign unfortunately that isnt to be
8292937 cant get overly excited by a down in the situation right now because this process does go up and down
8292938 benefiting from high oil prices and effective cost control the companys net profit for the first half of the year increased significantly
8292939 i have to say that while this is the worst year ever for chinas petrochemical sector the worst is still not yet past
8292940 advertising trends have continued to deteriorate over the course of the year and future performance will inevitably be linked to the economies of the uk and to a lesser extent that of the republic of ireland
8292941 environmental factors such as stressful life events may trigger an anxiety disorder more easily in people who have a genetic predisposition to the illness

8292944 i think the entertainment industry has all good intentions when we try to come out the thing that is unfortunate is that some of us who are maybe a little recognizable weve got to come out as private citizens and support our country in any way that we can
8292945 i think that not only can barack cause change because thats where his heart lies as a true american success story he understands how hard it is and when he says that he will when people come to him with problems hes been there i just heard the other day he just paid off his student loans two years ago and so when people talk about financial issues and the higher cost of education he really gets it
8292946 were going to find people changing on the inside and once we all have hope for the future i think youre going to find everyones going to wake up and take control of this amazing moment where theres so many things that need help and people will all be inspired to help
8292947 caregivers have similar cortisol levels as controls their cells seem to be hearing less of this signal in other words something goes awry in caregivers white blood cells so they are not able to receive the signal from cortisol that tells them to shut down inflammation
8292948 because people have traditionally thought that higher cortisol is the reason that stress contributes to disease but this work shows that at least in caregivers its actually the opposite theres too little cortisol signal being heard by the cells rather than too much
8292949 we dont know how to account for the resilience of some stressed people exposed to severe sustained stress or the vulnerability of some people to relatively mild stress
8292950 the better that we understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that link stress to illness the more likely we are to make progress in answering these important questions
8292951 previously addiction to benzodiazepines has been explained by reference to negative rather than positive reinforcement in other words the thinking has been that the reason people continue to use the medicine is that it helps to alleviate their distressing withdrawal symptoms and general discomfort rather than because it provides a sense of reward
8292952 our studies have shown that diazepam also affects the dopamine system which adds a new positive reinforcement mechanism of reward learning to the theory of benzodiazepine addiction
8292953 the mean brain volume in preterm infants with abnormal blood flow distribution was 45 millilitres smaller than in other preterm infants
8292954 we examined tissue samples from preterm placentas and classified them according to the amount of inflammation found in microscopic examinations inflammatory reactions were seen in 45 per cent of the placentas
8292955 a genotype causing strong inflammatory response increases the risk of placental inflammation but on the other hand protects the child against inflammation our preliminary findings suggest that genetic regulation of interleukin 6 is also associated with the volume of the deep gray matter of the brain
8292956 in order for us to create treatments that can help protect the development of the brain its essential that we systematically follow up the development of preterm infants this should always be an integral part of the care of preterm infants
8292957 differences in coverage between the data and the surveys can only account for a small part of the gap that has opened up between the measures
8292958 with such a consistent picture across both the surveys and the key determinants of consumer spending the monetary policy committee currently places rather greater weight than usual on these indicators in judging the near term outlook
8292959 this implies that non retail spending fell by around 0 5 percent the biggest drop since 2001
8292960 ive had that group of seniors starting for us for the last two years it will be a tough but exciting transition
8292961 its a passing of the torch which i think is important
8292962 we are going to miss the seniors but the bottom line is that new leadership is ready to take over
8292963 i expect them to step up and i know they both want to do so
8292964 they have been in the background here the last few years and are ready to take that next step
8292965 i watched and listened to her this spring and i have never heard that much out of her she really wants to lead this team
8292966 im really hoping it will work in motivating the young players to do the things they need to do in the classroom and be on top of their game when they come out onto the court
8292967 recruiting can be pretty methodical where you bring in three to four kids consistently
8292968 we really felt like due to the loss of the seniors and a couple of players potentially being unavailable in the fall it was important to bring a strong group in especially in the area of defense and passing
8292969 i think this is the first time in my 20 years that i have not known who will be starting at the defensive spots
8292970 but thats a good thing and it just shows how good the freshmen are
8292971 with laira potentially running the team in the fall it was good that she could be here in the spring
8292972 having over a semester of school under her belt is really going to help marquette is different the academic load is harder and heavier
8292973 the united states condemns the decision by the russian president to recognize as independent states the georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia this decision is inconsistent with numerous united nations security council resolutions that russia has voted for in the past and is also inconsistent with the french brokered six point ceasefire agreement which president medvedev signed on august 12 2008 the six point agreement offered a peaceful way forward to resolve the conflict we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the six point agreement the territorial integrity and borders of georgia must be respected just as those of russia or any other country russias action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations in accordance with united nations security council resolutions that remain in force abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognized borders of georgia and they must remain so august 16 2008

8293024 i realized that the narrative skills i was learning in my english studies made me a better doctor i could listen to what my patients tell me with a greater ability to follow the narrative thread of their story to recognize the governing images and metaphors to adopt the patients or family members point of view to identify the sub texts present in all stories any doctor any medical student can improve his or her capacity for empathy reflection and professionalism through serious narrative methods of study in reading writing reflecting and bearing witness to one anothers ordeals
8293025 one cannot watch death and suffering and not be touched but these feelings are hard to express hard to articulate and many times impossible to acknowledge as students run around the hospital not quite sure of what theyre supposed to do as student doctors poetry offers a language to express the inexpressible for those who wrote shared and listened in this context these moments of bearing witness became medical acts

8293045 that means no unauthorised person will have any access to such information

8293051 in december 2007 i was offered the position of investigator to focus on an unsolved double homicide from 1999
8293052 our chief of police darryl griffis read an internet article about dr bonds work at the university of leicester and northamptonshire police in developing latent prints on fired casings and it was decided that we should attempt to have our casings tested
8293053 we contacted dr bond and were invited to bring the evidence to northampton for processing in the hope that that with the leicester process a latent fingerprint might be located on the actual casing s itself which would help to bring more evidence against a possible suspect
8293054 this will be my first visit to the u k and i look forward to meeting with dr bond his staff and the members of the northamptonshire police
8293055 your process was one of many avenues located on the internet which showed promise towards assisting us on this case
8293056 we are hopeful that we may be able to assist colleagues in the kingsland police department georgia with the techniques we have developed recently we have already had some success at enhancing partial fingerprints on shell casings for other police forces where the cases were some years old and conventional fingerprinting techniques had been tried and failed
8293057 we now report evidence that restoration of the functioning of the stress axis may be the key to how these new antidepressant approaches might work
8293058 these findings lend weight to the hope that crf1 antagonists might play a role in the treatment of antidepressant resistant symptoms of depression or posttraumatic stress disorder if so crf1 antagonists could fulfill an important unmet need
8293059 we do not need another prozac but we urgently need to find ways to help the large number of patients who fail to respond adequately to our available treatments
8293060 they have enough trouble dealing with their own system and now theyre meddling in ours
8293061 sometimes people talk about this as a passport to the er they take enough so it looks like theyre having a miscarriage and then they have an aspiration procedure
8293062 the most common way is that women take herbs that are poisonous and take enough to poison the baby but not themselves
8293063 this is not easy to do unless the woman is sick enough to be throwing up and in serious pain its not going to work
8293064 we want to find what some of the barriers to reproductive health are
8293065 i think thats really what the issue is all about
8293066 cost segregation is a formidable foe of risk that might otherwise derail real estate deals in 2008 as it improves debt service coverage for real estate investors and reduces risk for lenders it represents the classic win win proposition in a tightening credit market it is a tool that all lenders and real estate investors should be considering
8293067 hace ya muchos a os que no compro tomates me limito a coger todos los que hay por el suelo
8293068 i like making music and fashion work music and fashion will never stop evolving i want to be always in the trend for both music and fashion
8293069 you need to read the detailed cpa letter that describes the returns the cashflow and the losses then tell me if it works
8293070 but theres so many zeros on the numbers its gotta be real its just gotta
8293071 i do not foresee any improvement in these issues for at least a year
8293072 declared him fit to run for political office and free of any symptoms
8293073 quasi religious ardor with which this restaurant approaches its mission
8293074 advierte que la econom a espa ola est en un cuadro recesivo
8293075 estamos ante una econom a en claro retroceso ante una crisis muy profunda y grave y con una intensa ca da del crecimiento del pib que refleja p rdida de bienestar de todos los espa oles
8293076 no podemos pedir todo el esfuerzo por una sola parte la de la moderaci n salarial es importante que los empresarios se dediquen a la inversi n y al mantenimiento del empleo
8293077 if you dislike americans so much nyaminyami why the fuck are you taking a job here
8293078 it makes me very upset to see americans enjoying themselves
8293079 if i cant be happy no one can be happy
8293080 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
8293081 having talking points on foreign policy doesnt get you there
8293082 cutting off support that will save the lives of thousands of american troops
8293083 and look tim if you tell me ive got to take away this protection for these kids in order to win the election some things arent worth it some things are worth losing over that would be worth losing over hundreds of lives are being saved and will be saved by us sending these vehicles over which we are funding with this supplemental legislation and i want to ask any of my other colleagues would they in fact vote to cut off the money for those troops to protect them thats the right question this isnt cutting off the war this is cutting off support that will save the lives of thousands of american troops
8293084 i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
8293085 would i make a blanket commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of each of those countries within the first year i was elected president absolutely positively no
8293086 the last thing you want to do is telegraph to the folks in pakistan that were about to violate quote their sovereignty
8293087 a nd im told senator obama announced today senator lantos sic and i wrote into law the requirement that the aid to pakistan be conditioned upon their support of us going after al qaeda in their western province it already is a law the question the way to deal with it is not to announce it is to do it the last thing you want to do is telegraph to the folks in pakistan that were about to violate quote their sovereignty putting musharraf in a position that makes it virtually impossible for him to do anything other than what hes done basically cut a deal with the warlords along that border to our great detriment so its not something you talk about
8293088 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan much of what senator obama has proposed senator biden has already initiated or accomplished
8293089 biden campaign congratulates sen obama for johnny come lately position
8293090 saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the united states or to his neighbors
8293091 s addam poses no imminent and direct threat to the united states or to his neighbors that the iraqi economy is in shambles that the iraqi military a fraction of its former strength and that in concert with the international community he can be contained until in the way of all petty dictators he falls away into the dustbin of history
8293092 helped to authorize and engineer the biggest foreign policy disaster in our generation
8293093 well look i find it amusing that those who helped to authorize and engineer the biggest foreign policy disaster in our generation are now criticizing me for making sure that we are on the right battlefield and not the wrong battlefield in the war against terrorism
8293094 this is a guy whos used weapons of mass destruction this is a guy whos destabilized the whole neighborhood this is a guy who in a war with the iranians over 800 000 people on both sides were killed this is a guy who is an extreme danger to the world and this is a guy who is in every way possible seeking weapons of mass destruction that case in and of itself ought to be sufficient
8293095 if the president of the united states was saying four years ago clear evidence of mass destruction do we have any choice but to eliminate saddam hussein and the threat
8293096 i still believe that saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction
8293097 i still believe that saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction and that the war in iraq was justified
8293098 statement of senator joe biden on the white houses acknowledgment that iraq uranium assertion was wrong
8293099 i mean look the president had a choice and it was a tough choice when he came when 9 11 occurred he could either listen to the advice colin powell and shinseki and most of the uniformed military and john mccain as well and dick lugar and others or choose the advice of the vice president secretary of state the secretary of defense and others and he chose the wrong advice and this i think we need a fresh start to be able to gain any momentum on this war on terror and i dont think were going to see any change id feel a lot better if i knew that president bush was going to be elected and im not being solicitous if i knew he was going to start to listen to john mccain instead of the secretary of defense because they have totally different no i shouldnt say totally many have very different views of how to proceed and so i think youd see a difference in the way how you prosecute the war in iraq i think youd see a difference in how you dealt with homeland security and i think youd see a difference in terms of the cooperation with other nations in terms of getting the consensus on how to deal with controlling chemical biological nuclear weapons
8293100 and so ive believed for a long time a view shared by my republican colleague john mccain and many others as well that we need more force in iraq thats not a popular position to take but we need more force now in order to have less force later we need to gain control of security in iraq
8293101 you may end up going against a senate colleague perhaps mccain perhaps frist
8293102 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
8293103 sen joe biden of delaware a former presidential candidate and longtime senator he could help obama with perceived shortcomings on experience especially with foreign policy
8293104 what americans are looking for is not washington experience but do you have life experience that is gonna lead you to make good decisions
8293105 i do think that increasingly what americans are looking for is not washington experience but do you have life experience that is gonna lead you to make good decisions and are you in touch with whats happening on the ground
8293106 what i was drawing on in dealing with iraq was a set of experiences that come from a life of living overseas having family overseas being able to see the world through the eyes of people outside our borders
8293107 and i have to remind them when i hear this you know dick cheney and donald rumsfeld had two of the longest resumes in washington they did and led us into the worst foreign policy disaster in a generation so long resumes dont guarantee good judgment
8293108 obamas n h swing the clinton brand human rights growing up in a muslim country
8293109 the sort of general notion of experience based on longevity in washington i dont think is sufficient to make the case to the voters of iowa or the american people
8293110 you should keep on doing the same things with the same people over and over again and somehow expect a different outcome and thats the definition of madness
8293111 what washington is really telling you is that you should keep on doing the same things with the same people over and over again and somehow expect a different outcome and thats the definition of madness doing the same things over and over again and expecting something different
8293112 the idea is to maintain a unified iraq by decentralizing it and giving kurds shiites and sunnis their own regions the central government would be responsible for common interests like border security and the distribution of oil revenues it would require a regional non aggression pact overseen by the u n security council and it would allow us to responsibly withdraw most u s forces from iraq by the end of 2007
8293113 his broader proposal calls for a political solution that would provide regional autonomy for shiites sunnis and kurds and guarantees by the central government that sunnis would share in the countrys oil revenues
8293114 prince turki told a conference on washingtons relations with the arab world that dividing iraq into three regions reflecting its shiite sunni and kurdish populations would be a disaster
8293115 to envision that you can divide iraq into three parts is to envision ethnic cleansing on a massive scale sectarian killing on a massive scale and uprooting of families
8293116 many middle east experts are horrified by the difficulty of dividing the nation
8293117 you talk too much and you say things without thinking about them norman ornstein a friend and admirer told the senator as he was gearing up for his candidacy i know ive got to be more disciplined biden replied
8293118 he has a tendency to over explain that doesnt inure to his political benefit acknowledges larry rasky who will be communications director for bidens presidential campaign
8293119 a s a candidate for the 1988 democratic presidential nomination biden withdrew from the race in 1987 amid accusations that he had plagiarized passages in a campaign speech from former british labor party leader neil kinnock
8293120 kinnock told of ancestors who played football after long days underground in the mines who recited poetry and paved the way for him to become the first in his family to attend college when he saw a tape of kinnock in action biden said it was a connect i mean i could tell how that man felt thats how i feel so he used it changing the names but little else at a debate last month in iowa
8293121 bidens way with words now seems to be a liability
8293122 but instead of crediting kinnock he told the audience he thought of it on the way to the debate
8293123 bidens way with words now seems to be a liability
8293124 biden acknowledged kinnocks language didnt fit his family perfectly his father was in used car sales his grandfather was a mining engineer but he had been told and assumed that other relatives had worked in the mines and to make it clear members of his mothers family had indeed been to college
8293125 bidens way with words now seems to be a liability
8293126 now the exaggerated shadow of those mistakes has begun to obscure the essence of my candidacy and the essence of joe biden
8293127 democrat joe biden is a compelling orator but he developed a serious credibility problem after questions surfaced about plagiarism and possible falsifications of his academic record
8293128 b iden soon ran into trouble at syracuse law he was accused of plagiarism after lifting five pages from a law review article for a course paper but his pleading i implore you dont take my honor convinced the dean to let him stay in school take the course over and wipe the slate clean
8293129 bidens way with words now seems to be a liability
8293130 sen joseph r biden jr his democratic presidential campaign battered by charges of plagiarism in his campaign speeches and in a law school paper admitted yesterday that some of his boasts about his college academic achievements were untrue including the claim that he had finished in the top half of his class in law school
8293131 specializing in the sort of earmarks doled out by sen biden
8293132 university of delaware president david roselle turned to the lobbying firm of william oldaker a well connected washington insider who had served as a campaign adviser and fundraiser for sen joe biden just a year earlier bidens son hunter and oldaker co founded the law firm oldaker biden and belair in a downtown d c office just a block from lafayette park and the white house working out of the same suite as the law firm oldaker also helped launch the national group a lobbying affiliate specializing in the sort of earmarks doled out by sen biden and delawares two other members of congress sen tom carper and rep mike castle
8293133 ud gets earmarks with help of lobbyists connected to biden
8293134 lobbying reports filed with the fec show hunter biden now 38 lobbied for national group clients such as universities hospitals and the san mateo county calif sheriffs department between 2003 and 2006
8293135 ud gets earmarks with help of lobbyists connected to biden
8293136 with oldakers firm playing rainmaker the university of delawares earmarks climbed dramatically the university has secured another 68 million from the delaware delegation in the five years since the national groups lobbyists began working for ud
8293137 ud gets earmarks with help of lobbyists connected to biden
8293138 while ud increased its earmarks the national group expanded its portfolio in 2002 the lobbying firm signed 28 clients three years later 70 clients were paying 5 4 million for the influence of lobbyists like oldaker and hunter biden according to the center for responsive politics campaign finance tracking web site opensecrets org
8293139 ud gets earmarks with help of lobbyists connected to biden
8293140 sen bidens staffers usually get a phone call from the national group at the beginning of the appropriations cycle and one or two followup contacts later in the process according to bidens office
8293141 ud gets earmarks with help of lobbyists connected to biden
8293142 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
8293143 as with his illinois state senate days the impression one gets from mr obamas brief tenure as a u s senator is that he is an unabashed liberal and one would be right
8293144 i think this is a last ditch effort to go out and rape the offshore continental shelf so that they own it and are able to use it as leverage in the future because they know if they dont get it in the last couple of months of this administration theyre not going to get it biden said
8293145 warner r va amendment no 1566 to the reid d nev substitute amendment no 1502 the warner amendment would authorize virginia to petition for the authority to conduct natural gas drilling and exploration in the states coastal zone
8293146 i see a role for nuclear but first youve got to deal with the security as well as the safety concerns id be spending a whole hell of a lot of money trying to figure out how to reconfigure the spent fuel into reusable fuel i would not invest in growing our nuclear power capacity in its current form but i would invest in sorting out the storage and waste problems
8293147 the resolution obama voted for would not have increased taxes on any single taxpayer making less than 41 500 per year in total income or any couple making less than 83 000 the 32 000 figure is approximately the taxable income of a single person making 41 500 per year after all deductions and exclusions

8293162 there are no other pacific islander producers to talk to there are no other festivals for us to learn from
8293163 so its about us experimenting and not making too many mistakes
8293164 youd never have seen islanders do before a beautiful very speccie show
8293165 its nice to set the benchmark to show our people are doing work of this standard
8293166 one of the problems was that the term was so loosely used that there was no grading or accreditation of experience
8293167 well trained ccd workers know how to build a project phase by phase training up a team facilitating creative group work and providing a safe place where young people can come and the goals for the project are realistic
8293168 youve got to be able to interpret what the demand is from within the community not go in and impose your ideas
8293169 and youre all good friends working together when it gets to the point you have to place your soul on the table thats hard enough but then as the work develops people start to get attached to it artistically and the emotions start flying
8293170 i know with our small company by the time youre into the fifth week of rehearsals we all want to scratch each others faces off but the work is based on peace building so you have to resolve your differences
8293171 you see an islander in the street tongan maori fijian or samoan and you might flare a nostril raise an eyebrow we constantly have this connection
8293172 theres an islander and hes not a footballer and hes not in trouble
8293173 work that is just going to entertain the pants off people and the food last pasifika festival we ran out of food and we got lots of feedback about that one

8293179 the reduction in cost of leds has allowed us to push the envelope and improve the resolution
8293180 basically you have 3 550 computers linked together on a gigabit data pipe communicating thousands of times per second getting pieces of the imagery and displaying it
8293181 even though we were increasing the resolution it didnt mean we had the luxury of drawing much more power
8293182 we had to stay within the same power footprint as before
8293183 in order to create big signs that can penetrate through the brightness of daylight you need leds
8293184 weve replicated the functionality of solid elastomers in a free rise foam
8293185 it turns out the foams that do a good job acoustically dont usually do a good job with mechanical energy
8293186 do we want to give the image of the tattooed person dancing on the table
8293187 were trying to clean up the village we have an image to protect
8293188 i wouldnt want anyone dancing on tabletops but is this something we should regulate
8293189 if a bar owner wants to subject himself to the liability of someone getting hurt thats a liability thats up to him its intrusive to an extent on the villages part
8293190 dancing on the bar youre taking away their freedom of expression
8293191 i dont think this board or this town should walk into a business and tell them how to run their business
8293192 caregivers have similar cortisol levels as controls their cells seem to be hearing less of this signal in other words something goes awry in caregivers white blood cells so they are not able to receive the signal from cortisol that tells them to shut down inflammation
8293193 because people have traditionally thought that higher cortisol is the reason that stress contributes to disease but this work shows that at least in caregivers its actually the opposite theres too little cortisol signal being heard by the cells rather than too much
8293194 we dont know how to account for the resilience of some stressed people exposed to severe sustained stress or the vulnerability of some people to relatively mild stress
8293195 the better that we understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that link stress to illness the more likely we are to make progress in answering these important questions
8293196 there were so many people on the stage the other day i thought i was doing ben hur

8293202 the last place where you can have a decent conversation
8293203 quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country
8293204 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business but its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going some place else in a much more expeditionary environment where the marine air ground task force really seems to have a true and enduring value then thats where we need to be
8293205 pooling data on vocal imitation vocal convergence and compensation for noise suggests a wider cross species distribution of vocal production learning among mammals than has been generally appreciated
8293206 animal communication has been a major emphasis in animal behavior and comparative psychology for many decades
8293207 however in recent years we have gone beyond the straightforward analysis of dyadic interactions between two individuals we now consider the role of eavesdropping deception and noisy environments in shaping signals and investigate how animals deploy them in various contexts
8293208 acoustic interaction in animal groups signaling in noisy and social contexts

8293216 its ability to change and adapt as well as acknowledging its important longstanding traditions
8293217 there were a lot of theories about this hebrew didnt translate to the screen the actors were phony the stories were unrealistic all sorts of things
8293218 we are in shock ourselves in a good way i hope that the wave doesnt change
8293219 maybe its a little bit heavy maybe thats one of the reasons it didnt succeed at the box office
8293220 but i dont know its very hard to say because i like the movie
8293221 overseas broadcasters and producers want to see movies about the political situation not about regular life in israel
8293222 those are the movies that sometimes have a lot of success outside of israel they want to see the special problems of israel
8293223 but every year we have three or four movies that succeed with the audience in israel some of them succeed outside but not always audiences in israel prefer to see movies about ordinary life
8293224 i think the americans were asking for products all over the world after the strike but theres been a lot of interest in israeli movies and tv
8293225 but they were asking us for more productions because theyve been in a crisis over there
8293226 the interest among overseas broadcasters is so much that we are selling concepts before the films or programs are even made
8293227 in the last year we have sold to the us south america eastern europe were selling concepts all the time were in shock about it
8293228 i dont know how to explain it but it all started with israeli cinema i think there has been a lot more interest in israeli movies in the last few years
8293229 the ball is now in the court of the wagner family

8293231 es waren leute mit kamera und ummantelten mikro unterwegs die gingen mit b mehrfach um das gel nde
8293232 eine person von links lief auf das gel nde von rechts kamen noch drei leute
8293233 und wenn ich damals auch so geschrieben habe dann stimmt das auch so
8293234 nach meinem sprint konnte ich leute auf den knien sehen ich bin dann auch auf das feld auf den knien gerobbt
8293235 es hat keiner nach mir getreten oder geschlagen sie haben nur versucht sich uns zu entziehen
8293236 dazu kann ich nichts sagen man ist sehr aufgew hlt
8293237 aber sie haben ja nicht uns angegriffen wir haben halt gezogen sie haben gerupft
8293238 wir sind ja nicht naiv es kann nat rlich den eindruck erwecken dass eine zivile person zu den anderen personen geh rt
8293239 ich kann nichts definitives zum tatumfang der einzelnen personen sagen
8293240 nicht mal an wem ich herumgezerrt habe ich war mehr oder weniger auf knien wer wie viel besch digt hat kann ich nicht definitiv sagen ich habe gesehen dass personen pflanzen ausgerissen haben
8293241 ich habe mit sicherheit pflanzen niedergetreten ausgerissen habe ich keine
8293242 da kann ich keine verbindliche aussage machen fakt ist dass wir auch einiges niedergetrampelt haben
8293243 es wurde an den pflanzen gezogen es wurde sich nicht zwischen die pflanzen gelegt und gewartet bis die polizei da ist
8293244 es stand eine m gliche st rmung im raum mit vielen fragezeichen
8293245 ich bin ja nur ein relativ kleines licht bei der polizei wo genau die informationen herkommen kann ich nicht sagen das zk 10 oder phk koch w rden mehr wissen
8293246 es ging um einen genehmigten informationsstand und eine angek ndigte feldbefreiung ich war einsatzleiter f r die kr fte f r den infostand und f r den objektschutz
8293247 wo der regul re zugang war wei ich nicht weil selbst wir ber den zaun gestiegen sind
8293248 der hat mit blo en h nden an den pflanzen gezogen mit beiden h nden als ich sagte er sollte das lassen hat er nur noch schneller gemacht
8293249 ich habe mit n und b nicht viel zu bereden wir kennen uns schon lange herr b hat mir schon in seinem buch mehrere seiten gewidmet
8293250 ich glaube nicht dass wir gr ere sch den verursacht haben
8293251 ich konnte mir nicht vorstellen dass so ein hoher schaden entstehen konnte
8293252 die mahnwache war eine angemeldete versammlung warum soll ich da viele kr fte hinschicken
8293253 die aktion war ja f r das wochenende angek ndigt
8293254 es ist sache der uni das gel nde abzusichern und in zweiter linie haben wir unsere objektschutzma nahmen gefahren
8293255 die polizei hat sich mehr sorgen darum gemacht als die uni
8293256 die mahnwache wurde im internet im gleichen zusammenhang mit einer feldbefreiung genannt
8293257 es sind bilder weggekommen unmittelbar nach dem tatgeschehen wurden welche aufgenommen sie waren nur als datei vorhanden die auf einmal nicht mehr vorhanden waren die festplatte war defekt ich habe die bilder nicht gemacht und nicht gesehen
8293258 die polizei hat sich mehr sorgen darum gemacht als die uni aber das ist sehr subjektiv berwachungsdienst kostet personal w hrend es so scheint als sei das alles bei uns einfach so vorhanden
8293259 es gab eine panne die wir nicht aufkl ren konnten
8293260 wir haben versucht zu organisieren dass rund um die uhr dort jemand vor ort ist
8293261 es gab eine panne die wir nicht aufkl ren konnten
8293262 herr bergstedt gentechnik spielt keine rolle bei der frage ob hier eine sachbesch digung vorliegt hausfriedensbruch auch nicht ich habe mir das selbst lange angeh rt aber wir sind an einem punkt angekommen wo ihre gentechnischen fragestellungen mit der frage der sachbesch digung nichts zu tun haben grenze vom thema zu weit berschritten
8293263 die frage die gentechnischen grundlagen f r das institut spielt keine rolle f r die frage ob die angeklagten es waren ob die es waren die daran beteiligt waren auf das genfeld einzudringen und pflanzen zu zerst ren ob dieser gentechnikversuch wirksam genehmigt war ob die mitarbeiter geschult waren usw spielt f r die strafrechtliche bewertung dieses konkreten sachverhaltes nach derzeitiger belehrung ich lass mich gerne belehren keine rolle denn sie wollen wahrscheinlich darauf hinaus dass hier notstandshandlungen widerstandshandlungen vorliegen nicht den hauch eines ansatzpunktes und deshalb sind fragestellungen dieser art und da bin ich mir sicher dass wir jedenfalls derzeit unterschiedliche auffassungen haben sind fragestellungen dieser art nicht zul ssig
8293264 es gibt keine richterinnen und richter mehr die sagen bei prozessen dieser art werden dinge wie der 34 berhaupt nicht beachtet in allen anderen prozessen wird das gepr ft da sind sie wirklich der zeit hinterher
8293265 die frage der zul ssigkeit des genversuchs spielt allenfalls am rande strafzumessung eine rolle
8293266 das ist die auffassung der sta aber sie wissen sicherlich auch dass die mit drei richtern besetzte beschwerdekammer des landgerichts diesen beschluss nicht beanstandet hat
8293267 daraus kann man nicht ableiten dass es von vorneherein klar ist dass man selbst dadurch dass man die fragen dazu nicht mehr stellen darf auch nicht eine andere thematisierung geben kann
8293268 nein ich werde ihnen sicherlich keine plattform f r eine politische kundgebung gegen die gentechnik geben
8293269 wir sind froh dass es noch vor ende der transferperiode mit der verpflichtung von marcel schied geklappt hat

8293272 in england people dont have time to feel the joy of life throughout the week they work so hard they only talk to people at lunch
8293273 then in the evening they watch tv so they can get up early for work the next day the main attraction is a timetable at the railway station where trains leave for less rainy cities
8293274 id like to clarify that i did not make these particular remarks i spoke about the difficulty i had settling in to life in manchester but that does not reflect how i feel now

8293282 das ist wie eine zwangsjacke am ende hatte ich kaum noch geduld
8293283 its certainly been a difficult year but buying out a partner is never an easy thing
8293284 we have to work together again as we did two years ago or the joint venture will have to find its own solution
8293285 youre always engaged in discussion and negotiation we and ericsson are always discussing ways of making sony ericsson as successful as it possibly can be
8293286 about that about planning planning is a comfort behavior we like to map things out although we know how quickly plans can change we make lists we search online for articles with bullet points or numbered task lists telling us what to do when the rug is pulled out from under you you fall to the ground quick and dirty the job loss the news that we were having twins these are more like standing in a calm sea then being hit by a wave from behind you go from standing firm with an eye on the horizon to crashing twisting swirling through the murky water unsure of which direction is up you can map out your life in infinite detail but still a rogue wave can rise at any time breaking upon you when you least suspect it in the form of a medical diagnosis an unhappy spouse the loss of a job or even an extra baby stowing away in a carefully planned pregnancy but what do we do when we once again break the surface of the water gasping for air we make another plan
8293287 elected on the promise to end the war pelosi and her democrats have instead voted repeatedly to fund it until the next administration even more galling to the anti war crowd is that there are even more troops in iraq under pelosis congress than there ever were during republican congresses
8293288 the most remarkable accomplishment of pelosis congress is that shes managed to lead to current congress to approval ratings that are even lower than president bushs
8293289 my friends it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8293290 and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership noo way nohow no mccain
8293291 estou t o perplexo quanto voc s eles s o extremamente peludinhos
8293292 zente d licen a que agora vou levar meus p s ao pet shop
8293293 i always make sure i eat the same breakfast an egg white omelet bacon and oatmeal it always brings me luck
8293294 i wear my old high school jersey under my uniform during every game so that the inspiration of where i come from doesnt leave me
8293295 i have a penny which ive carried for six years that i put into my shoe when i need a little extra luck i dont know if it helps or not but its always a comfort to know its with me
8293296 i build a 30 foot wicker effigy of the old english louisville
8293297 i spend a great deal of money each fall designing a direct mail contest scratch off piece which i send to everyone in the metro louisville area it says that if you scratch off the little football on it it will reveal who the greatest running back of all time is but what people dont know is that all of the scratch off pieces say alfonso smith youre not going to run this in louisville are you
8293298 first i contact the post office to request that they hold my mail for a week then i make sure the gas is turned off and that a neighbor has a spare set of keys also i stock up on sunblock because you know how expensive it is when you buy it there oh wait i thought you were asking me how i prepare my house when i go on vacation
8293299 i get up early and watch my favorite movie krippendorfs tribe starring richard dreyfuss in a way i like to sometimes think of myself as professor james krippendorf and that my team is like the lovable group of goofball family members im trying to pass off to university brass as proof of my discovery of a lost colony
8293300 first sergeant hatley then made the call to take the detainees to a canal and kill them
8293301 so the patrol went to the canal and first sergeant sgt first class mayo and i took the detainees out of the back of the bradley fighting vehicle lined them up and shot them
8293302 then we pushed the bodies into the canal and left
8293303 you cannot have one rule for some and another rule for others
8293304 well talk about upholding the law when it serves our purposes and change the law when we need to
8293305 we are ever confident that it the transfer will get done but i think we have always said it will go to the wire
8293306 we will keep moving it along and we would hope that he will be coming to join us at chelsea
8293307 robinhos time in spain has come to an end he is looking forward to being part of a new project
8293308 there were two players that he really identified one was deco and one was robinho
8293309 i think weve already seen the impact that deco has made on the premier league and weve certainly seen the impact he has made with us
8293310 if we get robinho i think the squad is strong and capable of competing in all competitions without him but with him its just that added dimension
8293311 ive played three seasons at real madrid and have given everything
8293312 then if we cannot as yet think alike in all things at least we may love alike herein we cannot possibly do amiss
8293313 keep your eyes on the crucifix for jesus without the cross is a man without a mission and the cross without jesus is a burden without a reliever
8293314 gustav is headed right toward the centre of the gulf of mexico hurricanes taking this route are usually threatening
8293315 between now and the weekend we could see crude prices encounter a fair measure of support as the uncertain path of the storm generates the usual consternation
8293316 we are not convinced that this crisis will be bullish for the energy markets as any punishment meted out by the west will steer well clear of russias energy sector
8293317 what i expect from opec is to keep pumping at the same level after the increase
8293318 its a paramount issue the rules are almost indecipherable for everyone
8293319 i concede the point that those who are functionally illiterate they would have challenges with any form
8293320 nossas tropas realizaram uma opera o nesta manh e temos informa es de que 30 militantes entre os quais alguns uzbeques foram mortos
8293321 bleibt der lpreis in den kommenden monaten in etwa auf dem aktuellen niveau oder f llt er sogar weiter d rfte der hochpunkt der teuerung vorerst hinter uns liegen
8293322 inflation bleibt die sorge nummer eins f r die zentralbanker im euro raum
8293323 the eastern portion of the fault has moved at a predictable rate and the earthquake activity associated with it has been what we would expect
8293324 but the western part of the fault has been lagging in terms of the number and size of earthquakes it seems to be straining absorbing the motion
8293325 it could mean that the fault is getting ready for a large earthquake or it could mean that the movement has been so gradual that we couldnt detect it
8293326 land stations also detected a four fold increase in the number of earthquakes along the blanco fault in 2008 compared to background rates
8293327 our monitoring may be missing a lot of earthquakes that are less than 3 0
8293328 the western side of the fault may be experiencing a series of mini quakes that we cant detect or it could be slowing creeping along in a way we cannot measure
8293329 but we cant discount the possibility that its energy hasnt been released and it will some day in the form of a good sized earthquake
8293330 you need quite a bit of vertical displacement on the ocean floor to generate a tsunami
8293331 between the land based network the hydrophones and other instruments the threshold of detection for earthquakes has definitely lowered over the past 20 years
8293332 but we still cant tell whether the western part of the fault has thousands or even millions of infinitesimal slips or it is building up to a major earthquake
8293333 with the continuing decline of the ogallala aquifer water level and increasing cost of pumping water the use of drought tolerant and high yield corn hybrids is a key for sustainable corn production under limited irrigation
8293334 we hope to reduce the amount of water required for corn by at least 10 percent
8293335 the new multiple stress tolerant corn lines can be used to produce corn hybrids adapted to texas and other southern states
8293336 they can be a powerful tool to save water and produce crops with yield and grain quality under stressful environments
8293337 most of our breeding efforts start by crossing tropical corn with temperate elite lines
8293338 then we select for desirable traits to broaden genetic diversity and introduce useful genes from exotic corn to improve stress tolerance agronomic productivity disease resistance insect resistance and value added grain characteristics
8293339 at 75 percent evapotranspiration you have 3 to 4 inches of available moisture that is used where if you are watering at 100 percent it is wasted
8293340 one of our experimental hybrids produced the same amount of silage in both locations when irrigation was reduced from 100 percent to 75 percent
8293341 developing and using new corn hybrids with improved tolerance to drought and other stresses is important and a viable water saving approach

8293347 our work uncovers an achilles heel of influenza a viruses that cause human epidemics and high mortality pandemics
8293348 we have identified the structure of a key target site for drugs that could be developed to effectively combat this disease
8293349 the x ray crystal structure gives us unique insights into how the ns1 and human protein bind at the atomic level and how that suppresses a crucial antiviral response
8293350 these experiments validate the ns1 pocket as a target for antiviral drug discovery
8293351 because this ns1 pocket is highly conserved in all influenza a viruses isolated from humans a drug targeted to the pocket would be effective against all human influenza a strains including the bird flu
8293352 this work underscores the value of scientific collaborations between large scale structural centers and individual biomedical research labs

8293356 we made several improvements in the technique that could allow us to perform this type of procedure routinely
8293357 we traditionally try to save the kidney for smaller tumors performing a robotic partial nephrectomy
8293358 for larger tumors however patients would get a very large incision on their side now we can remove kidneys with cancer through a single three inch incision near the patients belly button
8293359 i think this is going to be a big advance for having to remove the entire kidney because of large kidney tumors this could be a great improvement over traditional open and laparoscopic surgeries
8293360 the robotic instruments are like having my hands inside the body
8293361 we think well see the same advantages with robotic kidney surgery as we have with robotic prostatectomy
8293362 surprisingly the median household is just as good as the average professional economist
8293363 im a little surprised because economists are using sophisticated models but the consumers know whats happening with milk prices
8293364 it means economists need to improve their forecasting or at least be a little humble
8293365 inflation expectations are one of the most important factors in the economic environment
8293366 so if consumers lose confidence that could bring us into a bad economic situation
8293367 when theres rising inflation its beneficial to be in debt to purchase real assets because youll pay your debt back with money that wont be worth as much in the future
8293368 with high inflation you want to avoid bonds like the plague

8293373 the art of project management covers it all from practical methods for making sure work gets done right and on time to the mindset that can make you a great leader motivating your team to do their best reading this was like reading the blueprint for how the best projects are managed at microsoft i wish we always put these lessons into action
8293374 berkun has written a fast paced jargon free and witty guide to what he wisely refers to as the art of project management its a great introduction to the discipline seasoned and new managers will benefit from berkuns perspectives
8293375 most books with the words project management in the title are dry tomes if thats what you are expecting to hear from berkuns book you will be pleasantly surprised sure its about project management but its also about creativity situational problem solving and leadership if youre a team member project manager or even a non technical stakeholder scott offers dozens of practical tools and techniques you can use and questions you can ask to ensure your projects succeed

8293388 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
8293389 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
8293390 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
8293391 the companies are placing the appropriate legal work with the appropriate outside counsel
8293392 at this point i cant say what we expect from this feature were just curious to see how it will be used
8293393 unfortunately because the examples he provides are still only experiments we cannot talk in length about how they work
8293394 if we end up rolling out this experiment for all users we would definitely be able to talk in more detail right now we are experimenting with a number of factors so we cant really explain how the final product would work
8293395 we test almost everything even things that you would think are so small that we could not possibly care nor could they possibly matter in fact small changes do matter and we do care
8293396 ibm graciously accepts these awards as a testament to our leadership in the industry and the value that we add for our business partners and the channel

8293401 thankfully the schools web site has a search function that usually works and i was able to contact the help desk they told me i was right the links were broken and to tell the teacher blah blah blah so i emailed blah blah blah to the professor and he emailed back
8293402 hi everything works fine for me and i have heard nothing regarding such a problem from any other students
8293403 10 since jerry garcias untimely passing bob weir has been out on the road with ratdog for over a decade and next year the allman brothers band will celebrate their 40
8293404 now i know what you have been experiencing for twenty years with your invisible chronic illnesses
8293405 guest blogger my husband lives with an invisible chronic illness too
8293406 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8293407 but i assure you im really trying to set things right i want to be able to send you money i just cant do it today

8293410 i am very excited about the charleston classic opening our new carolina first center
8293411 this will bring college basketball to our beautiful low country and downtown charleston area clemson will be the headliner but there are other exciting teams that should challenge them for the first charleston classic championship
8293412 we are excited to be part of showcasing college basketball in charleston for the tip off of the season
8293413 this tournament also gives our fans of which we have many in the charleston area an opportunity to see our team play three straight days to open the season
8293414 even though the only reason hes not legal anymore is because hes waiting on the government to send him his visa he should be sent home
8293415 no but we shouldnt hold the people accountable for our elected officials mistakes we should vote them out of office
8293416 its these democrats who want to bring the illegals here to drive up voting numbers
8293417 no its the republican business people who bring illegals here and fight to keep them here because they want to keep labor costs down so they can make more money
8293418 let me ask you a question if you gave me a piece of the rocky mountains and told me to grow corn what would you say if i said it was impossible
8293419 i would tell you the same thing the early settlers who thought this land were on in the early 1800s from here up through the plain states was uninhabitable you never know until you try
8293420 youre telling me that someone who had a good job when they bought the house lost that job to a foreign country and is now having to re mortgage or even sell their house because they cant afford it couldnt afford it to begin with

8293438 so youre saying there is definitely prejudice against people with disabilities no doubt about it
8293439 i think its an old habit we havent gotten over yet i think we will though and we need to get that message out that people with disabilities can do much more than people think if we ever give them a chance

8293465 if the posted copies of the ten commandments were to have any effect at all it would be to induce school children to read them and if they read them meditated upon them and perhaps venerated and observed them this is not a permissible objective

8293468 individuals with a maternal history of the disease had progressive metabolic reductions in glucose usage and at a much faster rate in areas of the brain affected by alzheimers disease than subjects with a paternal history or no parent with the disease
8293469 a family history of alzheimers is a known risk factor for alzheimers

8293492 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8293493 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8293494 it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed and to recent russian statements
8293495 it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories
8293496 regrettable and we reaffirm our attachment to georgias territorial integrity
8293497 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8293498 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8293499 i want to re affirm the commitment of the united kingdom to support the democratic choices of the ukrainian people
8293500 my visit is designed to send a simple message we have not forgotten our commitments to you nor shall we do so
8293501 the georgia crisis has provided a rude awakening the sight of russian tanks in a neighbouring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8293502 the old sores and divisions fester and russia is not yet reconciled to the new map of this region yesterdays unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance
8293503 it is not just the end of the post cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around europe it is also the moment when countries are required to set out where they stand on the significant issues of nationhood and international law
8293504 in nato we will stand by our commitments to existing members and there will be renewed determination that there should be no russian veto on the future direction of nato
8293505 today russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago it has made military gains in the short term but over time it will feel the economic and political losses
8293506 if she truly wants respect and influence and the benefits which flow from it then russia needs to change course
8293507 isolation is not feasible russia is too enmeshed in the world economy
8293508 it would be counter productive its economic integration is the best discipline on its politics it would only strengthen the sense of victimhood that is the fuel for intolerant nationalism
8293509 it will only be a tragedy for russia if it spends the next 20 years believing it to be the case
8293510 these are actions that seek to promote prosperity and respect for russia but they have recently been met with scorn
8293511 over georgia russia has moved from support for territorial integrity to breaking up the country in three weeks and relied entirely on military force to do so
8293512 there are man dams little isolated reservoirs of men in suburbs across australia where for some odd reason there are more single men than single women and you find a lot of them in rural communities
8293513 if you find yourself in the wrong town why not relocate to the right town where you are in the market
8293514 this is to acknowledge that the verdict handed down came from a nonlegal trial and that anna goeldi was the victim of judicial murder
8293515 in spite of that they tortured an innocent person and had her executed although it was known to them that the alleged crime was neither doable nor possible and that there was no legal basis for their verdict
8293516 first sergeant hatley then made the call to take the detainees to a canal and kill them
8293517 so the patrol went to the canal and first sergeant sgt first class mayo and i took the detainees out of the back of the bradley fighting vehicle lined them up and shot them
8293518 then we pushed the bodies into the canal and left

8293523 youve always said that the russians are bullies only thing the bear understands is a sharp rap across the snout i believe was the phrase what do you advise
8293524 clearly a tangible rebuke is needed a punishment we could stop them joining the world trade organization
8293525 but its in our interest to have them inside a rule based international organization and before you say it the same goes for the partnership agreement the eu is negotiating
8293526 thats happened on paper and what about our supply routes to afghanistan through russia
8293527 well at least speed up nato entry for georgia and ukraine if chancellor merkel hadnt blocked it we wouldnt be here now
8293528 no we might not or we might be in the middle of world war three or trying to wriggle out of clear commitments to go to war
8293529 warn them about the dangers of ignoring national sovereignty by invading another country they could end up being regarded by the rest of the world just like
8293530 mark youve always urged keeping the dialogue open with russia and not treating her as a pariah isnt that just appeasement
8293531 such a dirty word minister putin is not hitler no our outrage is clear but back channels can also make it clear this is a special case russia has special interests here and if it is regarded as a bit of tit for tat over kosovo well we agree to disagree on these two cases
8293532 but its not a one off is it it is pretty clear they want to push back into the old soviet space
8293533 its a one off if we say it is if we say it is part of a wider crisis then it becomes so do you honestly think they are going to march into ukraine we have to keep nato membership on the table for georgia and ukraine but these things can drag on when did turkey first apply to join the eu 1959 i think
8293534 heavens no ramp up the rhetoric and warnings stand shoulder to shoulder with every plucky country in the region words like illegal disproportionate and even untrustworthy are helpful or may be deployed within forty five minutes
8293535 that america should hit the accelerator on the drive to further global dominance this approach borders on expanding us power for its own sake
8293536 freshness is not the point its the continuing thaw and it doesnt matter if the mood music is played twice
8293537 if this future is to be great if this future is to be bright if this future is to be a future of peace a future of justice and future of progress everyone will have to make an effort as the europeans did to put an end to the deadly spiral of war and violence that century upon century sporadically brought barbarity to the heart of civilisation
8293538 freshness is not important its the thawing of relations theres nothing wrong with playing the mood music twice

8293582 with frequent media stories about current and potential bank failures anxious depositors and suffering shareholders it is vitally important that stable banks reassure constituents of their long term safety and soundness allowing the market to frame the story for them is a mistake that too many banks are making right now

8293706 caregivers have similar cortisol levels as controls their cells seem to be hearing less of this signal in other words something goes awry in caregivers white blood cells so they are not able to receive the signal from cortisol that tells them to shut down inflammation
8293707 because people have traditionally thought that higher cortisol is the reason that stress contributes to disease but this work shows that at least in caregivers its actually the opposite theres too little cortisol signal being heard by the cells rather than too much
8293708 we dont know how to account for the resilience of some stressed people exposed to severe sustained stress or the vulnerability of some people to relatively mild stress
8293709 the better that we understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that link stress to illness the more likely we are to make progress in answering these important questions
8293710 the mean brain volume in preterm infants with abnormal blood flow distribution was 45 millilitres smaller than in other preterm infants
8293711 we examined tissue samples from preterm placentas and classified them according to the amount of inflammation found in microscopic examinations inflammatory reactions were seen in 45 per cent of the placentas
8293712 a genotype causing strong inflammatory response increases the risk of placental inflammation but on the other hand protects the child against inflammation our preliminary findings suggest that genetic regulation of interleukin 6 is also associated with the volume of the deep gray matter of the brain
8293713 in order for us to create treatments that can help protect the development of the brain its essential that we systematically follow up the development of preterm infants this should always be an integral part of the care of preterm infants
8293714 in december 2007 i was offered the position of investigator to focus on an unsolved double homicide from 1999
8293715 our chief of police darryl griffis read an internet article about dr bonds work at the university of leicester and northamptonshire police in developing latent prints on fired casings and it was decided that we should attempt to have our casings tested
8293716 we contacted dr bond and were invited to bring the evidence to northampton for processing in the hope that that with the leicester process a latent fingerprint might be located on the actual casing s itself which would help to bring more evidence against a possible suspect
8293717 this will be my first visit to the u k and i look forward to meeting with dr bond his staff and the members of the northamptonshire police
8293718 your process was one of many avenues located on the internet which showed promise towards assisting us on this case
8293719 we are hopeful that we may be able to assist colleagues in the kingsland police department georgia with the techniques we have developed recently we have already had some success at enhancing partial fingerprints on shell casings for other police forces where the cases were some years old and conventional fingerprinting techniques had been tried and failed
8293720 previously addiction to benzodiazepines has been explained by reference to negative rather than positive reinforcement in other words the thinking has been that the reason people continue to use the medicine is that it helps to alleviate their distressing withdrawal symptoms and general discomfort rather than because it provides a sense of reward
8293721 our studies have shown that diazepam also affects the dopamine system which adds a new positive reinforcement mechanism of reward learning to the theory of benzodiazepine addiction
8293722 environmental factors such as stressful life events may trigger an anxiety disorder more easily in people who have a genetic predisposition to the illness
8293723 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now
8293724 our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8293725 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8293726 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8293727 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8293728 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
8293729 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful
8293730 but they are not effective against global warming and in order to ensure the long term survival of this rich marine community that is what we need to address newcastle university
8293731 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
8293732 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
8293733 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
8293734 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
8293735 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable
8293736 we now report evidence that restoration of the functioning of the stress axis may be the key to how these new antidepressant approaches might work
8293737 these findings lend weight to the hope that crf1 antagonists might play a role in the treatment of antidepressant resistant symptoms of depression or posttraumatic stress disorder if so crf1 antagonists could fulfill an important unmet need
8293738 we do not need another prozac but we urgently need to find ways to help the large number of patients who fail to respond adequately to our

8293748 we have arrested two persons tanveer pathan and zahir patel both residents of surat for planting the bombs in the city
8293749 outsiders with the help of these locals planted the bombs in surat tanveer played a major role by showing the locations where the bombs can be planted but final selection of locations was done by those who had come from outside
8293750 it is clear that active simi members who went underground after the outfit was banned by the centre in 2001 were involved in ahmedabad blasts and planting bombs in surat
8293751 some local modules were also involved we are trying to get more details

8293756 there are many people in sa who are rich and who can share their riches with those who have not been able to conquer poverty
8293757 capitalism has been proved a false god because it leads inevitably to class war among rigidly defined classes socialism has been proved false because it has shown it cannot abolish these classes
8293758 the task is not to make the poor wealthy but productive
8293759 the wonder of modern institutions is not that they work so badly but that anything works at all
8293760 how can we be sure they have the capacity to manage funds in a responsible way
8293761 each of them is an example of how small and humble ideas can bring incredible results
8293762 sometimes they scolded those who were being completely careless towards the environment
8293763 most people use newspaper but it has a layer that makes it non absorbent so our last instruction was to rub it to make it soft and absorbent that way it flushes through the system
8293764 when a bit of creative thought is applied it is simple to find a variety of ways to help but we have to bypass the inertia the solution is simply to start start with what can be done push the boundaries by doing what we can do well no matter how small it may be
8293765 there is an urgent need to mobilise people who can help and work out simple solutions for those who need them
8293766 the only way to achieve this is to get real commitment from government a commitment that is above politics and above party lines
8293767 the most necessary message of all and one that needs to go out to every single settlement every municipality and every person rich and poor is that certain things in life are beyond politics environmental and health rights are common to all of humanity

8293821 whenever we read the obscene stories the voluptuous debaucheries the cruel and tortuous executions the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the bible is filled it would be more consistent that we call it the word of a demon than the word of god it is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind
8293822 it was something weve always talked about that building and how neat it was and how wed like to do it but it wasnt for sale

8293824 so hopefully that gives us what we need to know to do this one
8293825 its a unique building in the fact that its so structurally solid
8293826 that adds a level of complexity in terms of design you have to work around and in the means of these concrete floors and pillars and walls but at the same time it makes it a super strong structure

8293841 bill has become something of a cult figure among rovers supporters on matchdays and we are very grateful to him for his enthusiastic efforts down the years
8293842 matchday atmosphere is clearly important to both the fans and the team
8293843 we have a number of initiatives planned and regularly seek feedback and ideas from our fans forum
8293844 i brought it to the ground and there was a great atmosphere because of the drum
8293845 i kept going for a few weeks and the club brought me in for a chat and said they would like me to keep going
8293846 it was the same time as the sheffield wednesday band and was good for getting the crowd going
8293847 there are times in tight matches when the crowd getting behind the team can really make a huge difference and i know ive played a part in that
8293848 there are always people who moan and i know i get blamed if theres a bad result but ive loved being the drummer at rovers

8293880 it seems that it was an milf propaganda there was no military operation in darapanan because it is where the milf hierarchy is based segovia said
8293881 we condemn the use of children as fighters in the war he added referring to the photo supposedly sent by milf to media

8293887 in the absence of other policy options such as fiscal tightening or currency appreciation the onus will remain squarely on monetary policy to tackle inflation the rbi is aware of the balancing act it has to do as reflected in its policy statement on july 29th which not only raised the central banks inflation target for 2008 09 to 7 from 5 5 5 but also lowered its economic growth forecast to 8 from 8 8 5 we however expect the real gdp growth to noticeably moderate from 9 last year to 7 5 this fiscal

8293914 many markets continue to be strained it seems to me that we have to continue to be very vigilant about the status of the financial markets and their potential negative impact on the general economy

8293922 with snap we have the ability to populate approximately 60 to 70 percent of the information we need to process a workers compensation application with the touch of a button
8293923 that kind of time savings from an agencys perspective has to be worth money
8293924 snap will provide all the same capabilities for small workers comp except that this will be non exception based underwriting
8293925 when an agent is looking to place say a 5 000 10 000 or 15 000 piece of business it will either hit our sweet spot or not and were not going to waste either the agents time or ours
8293926 we just take the information from the expiring policy populate a new template within snap and put it through our rating algorithm with the new loss and payroll information

8293929 there are now communities who have clean water for the first time in more than three years and other communities who have it for the first time in their history
8293930 these alarming diarrhoea rates are being addressed by surfaid through our community based health program
8293931 and it quickly became apparent in this health program that there was a strong relationship between diarrhoea hygiene local sanitation facilities and the availability of a reliable source of clean water
8293932 plus carrying water is a chore exclusively for women and children in some communities it has been necessary for individuals to invest several hours per day in this task this consumes valuable calories transporting heavy loads over relatively long distances often uphill
8293933 in communities where malnutrition is common women including pregnant women and children do not have the calories to spare so it is our expectation that supplying clean water to these communities will have the direct effect of improving health more generally
8293934 the strong focus on community engagement and ownership has been a successful model for ensuring the long term maintenance of the facilities
8293935 and the approach of a hand up not a hand out is a central plank of surfaids philosophy in working with communities

8293948 this has been an important and formative week for me personally i have had the opportunity to meet and talk with those who some people call ordinary kenyans but who are in fact the real heroes of the last few months
8293949 i have been struck particularly by the impact of external factors such as food and fuel costs on the day to day life of kenyans
8293950 radical changes need to take place in kenya and i believe passionately that the resilience the drive and the skills of kenyans will ensure that our country emerges stronger from this process most critically of all we have no time to lose
8293951 i have put myself at the disposal of the people i will promote kenya and i will continue to champion the beliefs and principles that i and all kenyans share

8293979 the rate of grade 3 toxicity from 3dcrt with 78 gy in 2 0 gy fractions remains better than expected compared to historical controls however low grade late toxicity is significantly higher in dose level v than dose level iii these differences may be dose and or volume related
8293980 tolerance to three dimensional conformal radiotherapy with 74 gy in 2 gy fractions remains better than expected compared with historical controls the magnitude of any effect from fraction size requires additional follow up
8293981 this multicenter controlled phase iii trial failed to confirm the efficacy of betaseron in patients receiving definitive radiotherapy for locally advanced nonmetastatic non small cell lung cancer the use of beta interferon led to greater rates of both acute and late treatment related toxicity

8293989 results of this trial regarding psa response and clinical disappearance of disease are similar to historical controls and do not warrant further investigation of etanidazole as was done in this trial
8293990 patients with unresectable alpha fetoprotein positive hepatocellular carcinoma experienced improved survival and decreased toxicity when managed with post induction cycles of intra arterial cisplatin as compared with intravenous doxorubicin and 5 fu intravenous 131i polyclonal antiferritin did not improve survival when added to either post induction regimen but dramatically increased hematologic toxicities
8293991 the maximum tolerated dose of fractionated 2 50 gy hbi was found to be 17 5 gy the major dose limiting toxicity was hematological thromboleukopenia there was not a significant dose response effect on occult disease appearance of new disease or in the requirement for additional treatment although certain trends were noted for the higher doses when only patients completing assigned hbi from rtog 82 06 and 88 22 were compared there was no difference in the time to new disease or additional treatment in the treated field based on the investigative parameters of this study single high dose hbi was as effective as fractionated hbi
8293992 in patients with gleason score 2 6 carcinoma of the prostate a short course of androgen ablation administered before and during radiotherapy has been associated with a highly significant improvement in local control reduction in disease progression and overall survival
8293993 in a population of patients with unfavorable prognosis carcinoma of the prostate androgen suppression applied as an adjuvant after definitive rt was associated not only with a reduction in disease progression but in a statistically significant improvement in absolute survival the improvement in survival appeared preferentially in patients with a gleason score of 7 10

8293998 the study design could not credibly establish a safe dose for hepatic irradiation however it did succeed in determining that 33 gy in fractions of 1 5 gy is unsafe carrying a substantial risk of delayed radiation injury the absence of apparent late liver injury at the 27 gy and 30 gy dose levels suggests that a prior clinical trial of adjuvant hepatic irradiation in patients with resected colon cancer may have employed an insufficient radiation dose 21 gy to fully test the question
8293999 intravenous 131 i polyclonal antiferritin did not improve survival when added to either post induction regimen but dramatically increased hematologic toxicities
8294000 the results of the study indicate comparable efficacy using tumor clearance as an end point of des and megestrol although des appears more effective in suppressing testosterone it is also associated with a higher incidence of drug related toxicity
8294001 fraction size in external beam radiation therapy in the treatment of melanoma
8294002 these studies have demonstrated the toxicity and therapeutic activity of 131i antiferritin and the emerging role of radiolabelled antibody in cancer therapy
8294003 this clinical trial demonstrates that hbi has the potential to be used to treat systemic and occult metastases particularly if both halves of the body can be treated
8294004 present results suggest that further clinical studies with isotopic immunoglobulin are indicated
8294005 hbi achieves pain relief sooner and with less evidence of pain recurrence in the irradiated area than conventionally treated patients the most effective and safest of the hbi doses tested were 600 rad for the upper hbi and 800 rad for the lower or mid hbi
8294006 the results of the study revealed no statistically significant benefit of elective pelvic irradiation
8294007 periaortic irradiation was not associated with a significantly increased incidence of bowel injuries manifested by diarrhea no correlation between the total dose to the regional lymphatics ranging from 4400 to 5100 cgy and the incidence of bowel and bladder injuries could be established doses to the prostate in excess of 7000 cgy have not resulted in a significantly increased incidence of bladder injuries but have been associated with a significant increase in the incidence of bowel injuries manifested by diarrhea the techniques of pelvic irradiation did not seem to significantly influence the incidence of bowel or bladder complications the technique of delivery of the prostatic boost did seem to influence the incidence of bowel injuries this refers to the lateral boost technique and the perineal boost technique which have been associated with a higher incidence of diarrhea

8294169 this an easy call mark green gets our endorsement for mayor mr bloomberg has run hard but the fundamental argument behind his candidacy is flawed he claims that as a successful entrepreneur he is better qualified to be mayor than mr green a career politician
8294170 mr green has not been the most lovable candidate in new york city history but he has demonstrated a deep understanding of the issues a sensible approach to public policy and the soul of a fighter that may be the quality he will find most useful if he becomes the citys next mayor
8294171 nonetheless news that mr bloomberg was appearing to close in on mr green in a city with such an edge in registered democrats and after mr green had been acting as if victory were at hand caught supporters of both candidates by surprise they said mr green ran a safe campaign avoiding attacks on his opponents or offering a compelling case for his own candidacy

8294201 the theology of jonathan edwards and his insight into the nature of religious experience are simply too important too relevant and too enriching to sacrifice on the altar of some lofty ideal that is beneath his and our dignity to make his work accessible to a more general audience

8294203 that which many call the witness of the spirit this kind of knowledge knowing that a certain person is converted and delivered from hell and entitled to heaven is no divine sort of knowledge in itself
8294204 the evidence of this in scripture is very abundant if we judge the nature of christianity and the proper spirit of the gospel by the word of god this spirit is what may by the way of eminency be called the christian spirit and may be looked upon as the true and distinguishing position of the hearts of christians as christians

8294595 it makes the process so easy its scary not only can a cinematographer view shots immediately without rendering but staying in raw means that each 4k frame is just 16 mb instead of 48 mb combining this with the ability to apply creative looks non destructively makes for a super efficient workflow

8294647 people have been misguided in kashmir giving the politicians an opportunity the original mission is that the amarnath yatra should be conducted peacefully and with facilities all the kashmir leaders are saying this the amarnath yatra has not been stopped till date even when the militancy was at its peak in kashmir
8294648 recently also the amarnath yatra continued during the nine day shutdown in the valley and the kashmiris organised community lunches for the devotees during the shutdown when there was unavailability of food they kashmiris have been saying that they will never stop the yatra at any cost
8294649 every religious place should be respected and all the devotees should also be respected ive heard that the devotees going to kashmir are given a warm welcome and provided with food and other facilities by the kashmiris there is no communal feeling there what i feel is that the issue is political
8294650 it is common people who are the real sufferers the politicians can use them any way they feel like politics has been working behind this issue amarnath yatra is centuries old so why suddenly such an issue has been raised why not the issue was raised ten years ago or 20 years ago or 50 years ago it is all politics and we cannot understand it whats happening is bad and all religious places should be equally respected

8294753 hr professionals say that these workers demand more flexibility meaningful jobs professional freedom higher rewards and a better work life balance than older employees do people in this group see their professional careers as a series of two to three year chapters and will readily switch jobs so companies face the risk of high attrition if their expectations arent met the gen y cohort already representing 12 percent of the us workforce is therefore perceived as substantially harder to manage than its predecessors
8294754 finally knowledge workers the fastest growing talent pool in most organizations have their own demands and peculiarities by one estimate 48 million of the 137 million workers in the united states alone can be classified in this group knowledge workers are different because they create more profit than other employees do up to three times more yet the performance of knowledge intensive companies within the same industry varies significantly which suggests that some of them struggle to extract value from this newly enlarged type of workforce

8294827 it is difficult to defend russias conduct of the war with georgia but it is equally difficult to defend the willingness of the u s canada and other nato governments to recognize kosovos unilateral declaration of independence while ruling out future recognition for abkhazia and south ossetia if independence for minorities is ruled out from the start then they have no alternative but to turn to violence independence with security guarantees for ethnic georgians should at least be on the negotiating table
8294828 the other lesson from this whole episode is that nato expansion is foolish bringing georgia into the security guarantee would entail that our soldiers could end up dying in a war against russia while helping georgia crush the legitimate aspirations of its ethnic minorities is that what we really want

8295136 my understanding is its a last resort and certainly if the umpires on the field feel certain of the call and theres no need for it i believe they would be able to stand by their call
8295137 i think theres a value on some plays but it has to be a very limited application i mean very limited it cant certainly get into any other plays where an umpire has a view of an out or safe call or whether its a strike zone izzue i think this is just a safety net issue for some of the more game changing things that can happen whether a home run was fair or foul whether there was fan interference

8295141 as of today we are the largest sandwich delivery company in the nation
8295142 some of our sandwich competitors use units that look like microwaves or toaster ovens to try and warm a few of their subs we have high end ovens in our stores that cost 30 000 and bake our sandwiches at 450 degrees it gives us a huge quality advantage they cant match

8295146 since the introduction of vibram fivefingers a little more than two years ago we have received an overwhelming response from customers who are enjoying health and performance benefits from running in this product
8295147 the next obvious step is to take a scientific approach to this anecdotal evidence to enhance future product development plans and to fully understand what it means to run in our footwear
8295148 the few studies published on barefoot running have all asked normally shod runners to remove their shoes and run there is no data on how habitual barefoot runners run
8295149 we plan to compare runners in fivefingers with both shod and habitual barefoot runners for a more complete understanding of the possible advantages and disadvantages of barefoot or more specifically fivefingers training
8295150 if humans have always been built for and good at running why are there so many injuries today
8295151 our goal is to shed light on how the body works with and without shoes and to offer advice on injury prevention
8295152 now they are taking that technical expertise and tapping into the fashion side of the business to create a distinctly stylish collection of skiwear
8295153 i thought it was a good performance these kind of games are always potential banana skins if you dont perform properly then you can find a few upsets in the early rounds
8295154 the boys did really well scored three good goals and i think just as importantly kept a clean sheet and i thought they defended well
8295155 its funny how football throws up these little things but the back four did well so obviously it will be down to the manager to decide thats two clean sheets on the bounce so well see
8295156 the managers got a squad that hes got to choose 11 players from so the challenge is there for everybody
8295157 im no different to anybody else i need to try to earn my place in the team
8295158 the performance last night showed me its going to be difficult but its something im looking forward to
8295159 ive heard some good things about the manager and ive been told a lot a good things about the boys so i cant wait to get start properly
8295160 my first training session will be tomorrow morning so im looking forward to it but it was good to get on the bench and be in the changing room for the game
8295161 the ambition is to try to do as well as i can personally and obviously to help burnley as well its a big club and theyre looking to kick on
8295162 from my point of view i just want to come and play football
8295163 i needed to see that kind of stuff and know that i cant just be throwing the ball anywhere

8295166 we are seeing good growth at our two base schools and hopefully the increased numbers there will make up for any declines we might experience in town
8295167 its always a little dodgy in this first week of school
8295168 that program is where students are coming to school and meeting with their teacher three days a week and then on the additional two days theyre doing their independent study work and their parents monitor that work
8295169 it seems like parents were prepared for the lack of shuttle service and had made arrangements i have not heard of any surprises of people showing up for a shuttle that wasnt there
8295170 you have a lot more kids than you have buildings
8295171 you really do need additional buildings to accommodate your current enrollment
8295172 we had to do an analysis because we wanted to back up what i think we all knew intuitively
8295173 it helps when you see the numbers to see it in black and white
8295174 whats happened at the very top of the first round is ridiculous
8295175 when youre paying the guys who have never done anything more than star football players in this league that have played for years and established themselves at this level what theyre capable of it can be a little frustrating

8295206 theres glitches in in all games its really interesting to me because as an example theres gonna be things you can always you can always improve to me framerates not really that essential in cutscenes and it never has been for us i dont think too humans inconsistent from any of our previous games so theres clipping oh noes bottom line is does it affect gameplay and by how much are there ways to improve too human for sure but the overall big picture happy extremely happy
8295207 if its a sign that people love the game so much that they just want to get back in and play could we make it skippable sure its an easy change is it something we ever would have anticipated since we thought it was faster than going to get your body or losing experience which does not happen in too human is that a change we can make in the future sure

8295235 the biggest thing he brings to the ticket is he is qualified to be president of the united states
8295236 everybody when they talk about potential vice presidential candidates they put them in different categories here is one that can help the ticket by delivering a state here is one that can help the ticket by delivering an interest group but they always talk about joe biden he is the one who if something happens to barack obama he is qualified and i think that what is says about barack obama he is not in this thing to win this he is in this to make america a better place and a better place in the world
8295237 biden should and probably will go after john mccain and the republicans hard
8295238 if he does not and its a mild mannered presentation i think the delegates will leave very disappointed
8295239 everyone is going to be measuring every word that clinton says because it is very well known that he has been unhappy with obama some have said that he has been pouting
8295240 he and his people have certainly been leaking quite a number of crucial comments from clinton about obama so his words will be weighed carefully and he will come through he knows he is under the microscope he will be very enthusiastic while the cameras are on

8295344 the government has got to be seen to be helping ordinary people in these difficult economic times the price of oil is going up and therefore fuel prices are going up my own view on the prospect of a windfall tax on energy companies is that the government will be cautious about introducing something which has an implicit retrospective element to it

8295347 in addition to acquiring the test images which will be used to analyze and evaluate the quality control of the conservation we are focusing on a workflow that will minimize as much as possible the exposure of the scrolls to light and will aid in determining the time and manpower needed for the complete imaging of all of the thousands of scroll fragments the innovative technology will make it possible for the first time to scientifically measure changes in the state of the scrolls preservation the spectral imaging will graphically record the condition of a scroll fragment and in several months we will photograph it again under identical conditions at which time we will ascertain if any changes at all have occurred in the graph the fewer the changes that are discovered the better we will know that the scrolls are in an optimum state of preservation
8295348 i believe that by using spectral photography we will succeed through non invasive means to determine the amount of water present in the parchment from which the scrolls are made data such as this has added value for conservation and preservation issues if for example we discover that the parchments are too dry it will be necessary to modify the conditions in which they are maintained

8295383 he had been keeping an eye out for years and years and then last year we noticed one on tv so i followed it up and went and ordered a custom made one from england
8295384 it was specifically made for me its slightly different to the one that my father and grandfather had but its got the same characteristics and certainly the same ice cream that they sold
8295385 my grandfather tommy and his brother peter paul started the ice cream business in the early 1920s
8295386 they used a horse and cart to go around the town selling ice cream then they had the bike there used to be an old saying harrys ices are the nicest but not as nice as tommy prices that was in reference to harry galloway years ago who also sold ice cream
8295387 then my dad who was the eldest son and his brother tommy took it over and they introduced the van its 40 years old and still on the road
8295388 we still dont really know what they plan to do
8295389 i think they have picked these areas first as they are the easy ones
8295390 its good that lissize is mixed but the thing most people are worried about is it going to do you good or will it set you back it depends what they are looking for
8295391 it wasnt the best of days weather wise but we are very happy with the turnout we got
8295392 if you like seafood the annual fishfest is the place to go
8295393 weve had a huge response over the years and the event has grown more and more and it is now an annual fixture people came from all over
8295394 its all about creating a better awareness of seafood the different fish that are out there and the many ways they can be prepared
8295395 people could try sea bass mackerel tuna scallops sea food chowder cod lemon sole and oysters to name but a few
8295396 i was in such agony that they have to give me morphine
8295397 i heard staff saying that i was going to be taken to the burns unit in the royal but then was told that there was no transport
8295398 the same happened on monday and then on tuesday they said they were still waiting for an ambulance so i decided to make my own way down i was in great pain and just wanted to go and receive specialist treatment
8295399 if i had known that there was no ambulances available for over two days i could have gone to the royal on the night of the accident
8295400 the nurses and staff at daisy hill were fantastic no doubt about that but there is something wrong if a patient has to wait for 48 hours for an ambulance and theres still no sign of it its a disgrace
8295401 we need full time ambulance cover in the event of such serious injuries
8295402 ya tuhan ku berilah aku ilham untuk tetap mensyukuri nikmat mu yang telah engkau anugerahkan kepadaku dan kepada dua orang ibu bapakku dan untuk mengerjakan amal saleh yang engkau redhai dan masukkanlah aku dengan rahmat mu ke dalam golongan hamba hamba mu yang saleh
8295403 the filmmaker disgracefully humiliates his parents before a global audience
8295404 the geocoins will act as travellers moving from cache to cache aided by people who find them being logged every time they are discovered
8295405 we are able to see the scrolls in such detail that no one has before
8295406 pulling him and pushing him keep doing it telling people this is a sad moment and look hes not doing it
8295407 he goes i dont want to do it i dont want to do it
8295408 he kept pressuring him make him do the knife thing pulling him trying to get his t shirt off pulling and pushing him
8295409 swung it once or twice and said i dont want to do it anymore
8295410 it was an emotional time and the children were happy they asked for it no one forced anyone
8295411 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8295412 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8295413 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8295414 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8295415 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer
8295416 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough
8295417 and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumor inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add to them that will boost the chemopreventive activities of berries alone
8295418 were pleased with it and we think it vindicates what weve been saying all along that keith gore did absolutely nothing wrong
8295419 and were disappointed that the collin county das office would put a district judge in the position of of having to issue an illegal search warrant of a lawyers office
8295420 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware

8295422 weve all spent a lot of time and enthusiasm seeking her nomination to be president of the united states
8295423 most of us perhaps all of us however never were in it to be against obama now that this decision has been made our decision is to support enthusiastically the nomination of barack obama and joe biden
8295424 we came together last night we are here together today indivisible
8295425 i dont think it makes any difference if its one two or three who vote for hillary clinton
8295426 we are 100 percent barack obama no matter how we vote
8295427 come into my shop let me cut your mop its free
8295428 i dont believe that it is israels policy to increase activity in the settlements rather it is to decrease activity
8295429 no renters have gotten anything from the 10 billion road home community block grant
8295430 theres been much attention in the press about the fact that those who were left behind in new orleans were disproportionately poor and african american ive said publicly that i do not subscribe to the notion that the painfully slow response of fema and the department of homeland security was racially based the ineptitude was colorblind
8295431 i see no evidence of active malice but i see a continuation of passive indifference on the part of our government towards the least of these
8295432 i am not just doing the ballet that i would otherwise do if i werent disabled my dance comes from the fact that i have impairment the very movement itself is shaped by the impairment
8295433 the chair is a part of my body it is not a replacement for the parts of my body i have come to think of it as an integral part of my body
8295434 the emotional power of my movement is not coming from the chair itself its coming from me
8295435 pace fra ilor i dragoste mpreun cu credin a din partea lui dumnezeu tat l i din partea domnului isus hristos harul s fie cu to i cei ce iubesc pe domnul nostru isus hristos n cur ie amin
8295436 in 1992 a christian couple from waco and a baylor student spent some time getting to know several of the homeless men sleeping under the interstate 35 bridge over the next few months the men accepted the invitation to meet fort bible study on sunday mornings at the bridge over the weeks and months the small group grew to include more homeless folks other lower income people and local community persons who either had no church experience or felt like they did not fit in other local churches many of the basic needs of the lower income and homeless were met through the shared resources available within a couple of years the bible study group realized god was doing something more than just a bible study thus church under the bridge acknowledged its existence and began taking on more responsibilities as the body of christ
8295437 ikon operates more than 400 sales and services locations mainly in europe and the united states it has long and established business ties with many major customers in the u s
8295438 by combining the strengths of ikon and ricoh we can create a strong business entity
8295439 we cant say this is a four or five year plan its not its also a four or five year plan but its a six month plan
8295440 the score was indicative of that top to bottom all facets they just played better than we did
8295441 everything that had to happen didnt happen for us and it did happen for them
8295442 we were able to put a little pressure on sheets but he was able to make the pitch when he needed to make it
8295443 but i think when you look at hart going and wellemeyer trying to cover what was the tougher throw i think probably trying to hit wellemeyer on the run
8295444 the pitch to braun just came back over the plate
8295445 it was inside and it came back over the middle if youre trying to throw it on the right side of the plate it means my elbow probably dropped a little bit so i was probably a little tired
8295446 the money was supposed to go towards our vacation but we probably lost that much in the casinos
8295447 whether were together or not in 10 years 20 years 40 years well have the magazine layout to look at and remember some incredible sex filled times
8295448 if you dwell on statistics you get shortsighted if you aim for consistency the numbers will be there at the end

8295459 as of today we are the largest sandwich delivery company in the nation
8295460 some of our sandwich competitors use units that look like microwaves or toaster ovens to try and warm a few of their subs we have high end ovens in our stores that cost 30 000 and bake our sandwiches at 450 degrees it gives us a huge quality advantage they cant match
8295461 people fed up with brown bagging or driving to pick up something cold can save some time and gas by ordering a hot dominos sandwich for delivery to their home or office
8295462 i find it disturbing that theres a zombie story i havent read
8295463 of course hell fight if he was doing drugs if he had been drunk if he had gone out there and done what he did because he was pissed off at someone that would be a completely different story but he was ill and in this company we support our friends and anyone who works for us when theyre ill and have problems he was ill the incident occurred and now hes fine rampage feels awful about the womans baby but he had nothing to do with it and the traffic incident occurred because he was very ill and not with him in control of his faculties
8295464 maar voor de kleuren van die auto is gewoon geen excuus
8295465 there is no reason why joe public cannot do this save themselves a bit of money and help the environment because they are not using fossil fuels
8295466 whenever people have had oil they have been really really willing to give it its a waste product for them so we are taking away their rubbish
8295467 with petrol prices so high lots of people are looking for ways to reduce their fuel bills and this is a fantastic way to do it
8295468 there are still things we want to do with the african setting and i think its safe to say well continue to explore it
8295469 we might find something new and compelling about the antarctic setting
8295470 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8295471 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8295472 it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed and to recent russian statements
8295473 it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories
8295474 regrettable and we reaffirm our attachment to georgias territorial integrity
8295475 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8295476 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8295477 i want to re affirm the commitment of the united kingdom to support the democratic choices of the ukrainian people
8295478 my visit is designed to send a simple message we have not forgotten our commitments to you nor shall we do so
8295479 the georgia crisis has provided a rude awakening the sight of russian tanks in a neighbouring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8295480 the old sores and divisions fester and russia is not yet reconciled to the new map of this region yesterdays unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance
8295481 it is not just the end of the post cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around europe it is also the moment when countries are required to set out where they stand on the significant issues of nationhood and international law
8295482 in nato we will stand by our commitments to existing members and there will be renewed determination that there should be no russian veto on the future direction of nato
8295483 today russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago it has made military gains in the short term but over time it will feel the economic and political losses
8295484 if she truly wants respect and influence and the benefits which flow from it then russia needs to change course
8295485 isolation is not feasible russia is too enmeshed in the world economy
8295486 it would be counter productive its economic integration is the best discipline on its politics it would only strengthen the sense of victimhood that is the fuel for intolerant nationalism
8295487 it will only be a tragedy for russia if it spends the next 20 years believing it to be the case
8295488 these are actions that seek to promote prosperity and respect for russia but they have recently been met with scorn
8295489 over georgia russia has moved from support for territorial integrity to breaking up the country in three weeks and relied entirely on military force to do so
8295490 capitalism is a wonderful thing but it shouldnt apply to health care
8295491 vision is the art of seeing what is invisible to others
8295492 we were no longer able to burn our rubbish so we thought the best policy was not to produce any in the first place
8295493 what seems to be happening now in our society is that conduct standards and overall sense of individual and community life are not based on ethical standards values but the immediate criteria consumerist hedonist and pragmatic
8295494 in an overall total of 40 medals for the continent 17 were won by women

8295498 if citizens vote it should be for a specific matter on which they are well informed not because of general concerns about a new technology
8295499 well actually the shape and color patterns have been shown to appeal to human sensory systems
8295500 how life changing was it for you when you tried this thing

8295507 this is not a succedaneum for satisfying the nympholepsy of nullifadians rather it is hope that the haecceity of this enchiridion of arcane and recondite sesquipedalian items will appeal to the oniomania of an eximious gemeinschaft whose legerity and sophrosyne whose sprachgef hl and orexis will find more than fugacious fulfillment among its felicific pages

8295510 we are definitely noticing a significant downward trend in travel this year
8295511 but even as californians face steep increases in travel expenses they continue to put a high value on travel in their lives and find resources for quick getaways with family and friends
8295512 with shoulders like this every time you do something for the first time it feels terrible
8295513 its like the first time i did a pushup four weeks ago oh my god and the next day i could have done 10 you build your shoulder and confidence
8295514 not being able to shoot like i normally can was disappointing
8295515 im not 100 per cent but its getting better and my shots are getting better
8295516 each year three space shuttle missions could bring enough fuel for all human beings across the world
8295517 levinator 25 you seem to think your jesus shoot video was a glitch in the game its not a glitch hes just that good
8295518 you could keep your whole act and just switch bush for mccain
8295519 definitely john mccain would be better to make fun of because hes 100 years old says comedian and actor jamie kennedy
8295520 we are really blessed with the bush era as a comic
8295521 he provided about as much material as a president could ever provide
8295522 how stupid do you have to be if youre from a family where the smart brothers named jeb
8295523 if bush hadnt done all the stuff that hes been doing the past couple of years we wouldnt have woke up
8295524 as much as we hate him we gotta thank him
8295525 i wouldnt want expletive chuck norris to tell me to vote for anybody
8295526 i tell fans i dont think you should vote for somebody because an entertainer tells you to
8295527 when jfk was running and you looked at all the famous supporters he had it looked like such a long time ago but now here you are and this is history for kids kids are gonna have to write essays and answer questions
8295528 the 2006 california heat wave impacts on hospitalizations and emergency department visits
8295529 as our climate changes with more extreme events californians can expect longer more intense heat waves like the one in the summer of 2006 which means more heat related illnesses and emergency room visits
8295530 we need to prepare now to prevent some of the worst impacts future heat waves could have on our health as well as act to reduce the number of these events by cutting global warming pollution
8295531 today marks womens equality day so its fitting that we gather today to honor women making history you just need to look around the room to recognize that weve made a lot of progress in 88 years the women who have blazed the trail have shown us a profound truth that when women participate all women make progress thats really the message of lifetimes every woman counts campaign
8295532 we are so excited to have lifetimes involvement in this historic caucus said mame reiley democratic womens caucus chair
8295533 we are 51 of the vote we must galvanize to become a collective voice on capitol hill
8295534 my grandmother voted my mother voted and they instilled in me the importance of making your voice be heard now i am so excited my goddaughter aspires to be president not the presidents wife
8295535 im here to represent all the desperate housewives who are in this room
8295536 they have enough trouble dealing with their own system and now theyre meddling in ours
8295537 do we want to give the image of the tattooed person dancing on the table
8295538 were trying to clean up the village we have an image to protect
8295539 i wouldnt want anyone dancing on tabletops but is this something we should regulate
8295540 if a bar owner wants to subject himself to the liability of someone getting hurt thats a liability thats up to him its intrusive to an extent on the villages part
8295541 dancing on the bar youre taking away their freedom of expression
8295542 i dont think this board or this town should walk into a business and tell them how to run their business

8295561 while catholic teaching is clear that life begins at conception many catholics do not ascribe to that view
8295562 that it is the body and blood of christ when we go to church it is the body and blood of christ
8295563 yes the host and the wine represent the body and blood of christ
8295564 not represent is it is the body and blood of christ

8295573 the baltic sea is influenced by a multitude of human activities regulated by a patchwork of international and national regulations and authorities
8295574 what the baltic sea needs now is political leadership that can look beyond national or sectoral interests and take an integrated approach to solving the problems
8295575 her persistent efforts to unite groups and encourage cross border discussions on the future of the baltic sea
8295576 we now have an opportunity in the area of sea use management with two current processes on the european level
8295577 currently the glory in the global fight against climate change is reserved for those progressive governments which are getting the debate further down to the essentials
8295578 the cumbersome talks in accra did not stop a first group of determined negotiators from working towards a critical shift in the debate but a success at the next climate talks in poznan is far from secured and we need to see more countries engage seriously in lifting the political ambitions
8295579 smoke grenades thrown by backward parties and an overdose of procedural discussions have paralyzed the climate talks and overwhelmed negotiators for too long
8295580 in accra we start seeing the first positive examples of constructive dialogue led by innovative parties which should become a solid trend in poznan in december
8295581 the eu disappointed in accra just like it disappointed at previous talks in bonn expressing regret for coming to the negotiation table with empty hands
8295582 poznan should be a home match for the europeans and a perfect opportunity to live up to their full potential in order to avoid matching canada russia japan australia and the us in their lack of ambition
8295583 in the most ordinary of situations capital cases require more time to prepare and litigate and this kind of deadline would be impossible to meet adequately given the salience of torture in these cases as well as the due process national security and logistical restrictions on lawyers they are anything but ordinary
8295584 from the beginning the guantanamo military commission system has been weighted in favor of the prosecution and the imposition of unreasonable deadlines for defense counsel is just another side of a fundamentally flawed system rushing through these proceedings in the blink of an eye and without even a semblance of fairness is unacceptable and makes a mockery of our justice system
8295585 proceedings that are conducted in such a biased way can offer no true sense of justice having been achieved all americans including the victims of 9 11 deserve better than an unfair system that results in an illegitimate outcome
8295586 the president is on the cusp of conserving more ocean territory than any leader has ever done thats an amazing legacy to leave the nation
8295587 the presidents focus on ocean protection first with papahanaumokuakea marine national monument in hawaii and now with these proposed monuments is the kind of leadership we need now and from future presidents to ensure our world beneath the waves is protected explored studied and cherished
8295588 ive been privileged to work in some of the most pristine and magnificent ocean areas in the world and the central pacific islands are unparalleled
8295589 if there was a poster child for protection this area is certainly it
8295590 there are very few places on earth like the central pacific islands
8295591 it is a place that time forgot spectacular wildlife stunning beauty and almost no people or even human activity a monument designation will celebrate and protect this extraordinary place
8295592 this sends the wrong message to other perpetrators of violent crimes against women that they will not be held accountable for their actions
8295593 while there appears to be conflicting reports on the circumstances of the release of these prisoners whatever the circumstances this is clearly an injustice against the victim the victims family and all afghan women
8295594 such injustice can only promote a culture of impunity for violence perpetrated against women
8295595 those who murdered this champion of iraqs reconstruction must be seen for what they are criminals working against the interests of the people of iraq
8295596 mr shiya was a devoted public servant who was committed to the safeguarding of iraqs rich cultural heritage
8295597 in the final analysis many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy they are thus part of the market failure that is climate change
8295598 reforming energy subsidies opportunities to contribute to the climate change agenda
8295599 whereas fossil fuel subsidies are an example of a blunt policy instrument perpetuating old and inefficient economic models the cdm is an example of a more intelligent market based mechanism that is fostering the transition to a modern green economy
8295600 the maricopa county board of supervisors and the sheriffs office spent a lot of money they spent a lot of time they wasted a lot of taxpayers time and most importantly they destroyed the lives of thousands and thousands of homeless children and for that they can never be forgiven ever
8295601 we are in the process of gearing up to prosecute
8295602 guilty is still guilty ask yourself when was the last time you were on probation its a big deal
8295603 these three events add up to a planet in deep trouble
8295604 but while states and companies are responding to the climate crisis the washington politicians are just spraying offshore oil on the fire
8295605 rather than investing in oil and other fossil fuels that make the problem worse washington needs to follow the example of states and turn its resources to further developing the clean energy that can get us out of this crisis
8295606 if i saw her michelle malkin in the street id kick her in the cunt

8295616 it was billed as the breakthrough moment the democratic national convention which prohibited gov
8295617 the casey collapse can only be understood against the forces he must deal with on a constant basis for example the democratic national convention has already been host to the presidents of naral and planned parenthood and yesterday featured an emilys list event emilys list is the nations richest pac and it only gives money to abortion rights women candidates for office at its special gathering on tuesday it was able to attract the most radical pro abortion women in america not surprisingly hillary and michelle were there that this is the only venue where those two could ever find common ground speaks volumes it also explains why casey settled for clich s

8295650 home prices are becoming affordable again so the decline in prices is likely more than half over
8295651 many analysts do not expect the financial markets to improve significantly until home prices stop falling the pace of existing home sales remains low and available inventory relatively high both indicating that buyers are not yet able to step into the market at current prices
8295652 however that could change within a year home prices are becoming affordable again so the decline in prices is likely more than half over
8295653 the median home price is now more affordable to the median household than at any time since the start of 2004 my analysis suggests that housing prices will have to fall a bit more but the housing market is not far from being reasonably valued for the first time in five years
8295654 meanwhile rental costs have remained stable and apparently have not had any effect on housing prices independent of household income historically there have been wide swings in the ability of the median household to afford an average house
8295655 in contrast the cost of renting a primary residence has tracked the growth in median household income very closely
8295656 the price appreciation in a hypothetical reit portfolio has followed the same long term trajectory as house prices have during the past fourteen years although reits have been far more volatile from month to month and have had corrections 1997 1999 and 2002 that housing prices did not experience
8295657 apartment reits are actually positive for 2008 that is consistent with the notion that housing prices are near their lows
8295658 the implication of this is that real estate investors should look to get back in for long term holdings
8295659 recommended reit exchange traded funds to buy on market dips include the rez which yields 4 7 and which can be bought at 388 a share or below

8295683 they still have players in there who have got the job done
8295684 even with them out of there i think you kind of keep in mind that the way theyve been playing theres no letdown regardless of whos in there

8295688 in the midst of these crises the general assembly is holding a special session on the governors veto of a bill increasing the width of boat trailers on state highways certainly lt gov perdue and the democrat legislative leaders have a right to consider the merits of the governors veto of boat trailers but why dont they show the same leadership in dealing with three major crises facing our schools our mental health system and our state employees and their families

8295709 sir mr obama is not the president and does not reside here
8295710 i would like to go in and speak with president barack obama
8295711 sir this is the third day in a row you have been here asking to speak to president obama i have already told you several times that mr obama is not the president and he doesnt reside here dont you understand
8295712 oh i understand you fine i just love hearing your answer
8295713 he doesnt want to join either man city or everton and we are now discussing the next move to see what we do
8295714 because of all the problems there city and the uncertainty surrounding the place he is unsure
8295715 he is speaking with the manager scolari at the moment but he is settled in london he would like to stay and thats the bottom line but it is up to the manager we are looking at all the options really at this moment in time so i cant really say much more
8295716 every major piece of legislation in that time hes had an impact on one way or the other
8295717 hes been a great mentor and a great teacher ive learned an enormous amount
8295718 we now have the widest gap we have ever had between republicans and democrats
8295719 its the most powerful predictor of party id and partisan voting intention
8295720 and in a society that values religion as much as this one when there are high levels of religious belief and commitment and practice thats significant
8295721 america is great because she is good and if america ever ceases to be good america will cease to be great
8295722 our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other
8295723 the notion that it is improper to look beyond the borders of the united states in grappling with hard questions has a certain kinship to the view that the u s constitution is a document essentially frozen in time as of the date of its ratification
8295724 appeals to a common sense of what judges roles ought to be in a properly functioning constitutional democracy judges are not to overturn the will of the legislative majorities absent a violation of a constitutional right as those rights were understood by the framers
8295725 to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions is a very dangerous doctrine indeed and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy
8295726 i had someone ask me in this process i dont remember who it was but somebody asked me you know are you going to be on the side of the little guy and you obviously want to give an immediate answer but as you reflect on it if the constitution says that the little guy should win the little guy is going to win in court before me but if the constitution says that the big guy should win well then the big guy is going to win because my obligation is to the constitution thats the oath
8295727 the american people will never be able to regain democratic self government and thus shape public policy until we curb activist judges
8295728 someday youre going to get a very conservative supreme court and regret that approach

8295764 customers are looking for mid tier products rather than high tier products
8295765 its a fresh start now a brand new season im going to be a freshman at boston college and thats the way you have to look at it that it is the start of a whole new career whatever happened in the past nobody cares what happened in the past you could be the best peewee player nobody cares anymore its all about what happens now
8295766 it was hard to see stuff like that happen to jimmy but he just stuck with it and we were pulling with him
8295767 jimmy is one of the hardest workers that was on our team hes a leader you just cant say enough about the guy he helped our team out
8295768 the national team gave me plenty of opportunity to play it wasnt on account of that
8295769 it just didnt go the way i wanted and i wasnt having the season i had before it was confidence issues and stuff i just wasnt scoring goals it just wasnt happening
8295770 i think hes skating well and hes using his size in the camp and thats what we wanted him to do
8295771 i think his confidence is there and hes had a good camp
8295772 im moving on and feeling really good about it im looking forward to next year at north dakota everything my brother told me about that place sounds phenomenal ive been there a few times and its an unbelievable place im really happy to be going there
8295773 everybodys like what happened to you hes a special player i love him more than anything in the world my family means the most to me him and i are really close and spend every day of the summer together
8295774 some people say that he might have an attitude but whoever says that doesnt even know phil
8295775 hes one of those kids that no matter what you throw at him hell deal with it he had the cancer thing a couple years ago and he dealt with that that was one of the hardest times for me to get past im really happy with whats going on with him and hopefully he can actually get to 20 goals this year i gave him a little bit of a hard time for that last year
8295776 hes been through it all the day i got drafted he told me to get out of the house and just dont worry about it the way that he helped me prepare day in and day out getting to work out with him and to skate with him it helped me turn the corner hes definitely one of the guys that will always be there and hell be one of the main people responsible for my success because of how much hes worked with me
8295777 i dont think theres anything wrong with that as far as playing with those programs
8295778 the coaching staff is so trustworthy at north dakota theres no way he can go wrong there its a great place for him to really spend some extra time on the ice that you dont get at shattuck he can really improve on all the little parts of his game hes got everything he needs there and everything he could ask for
8295779 people might think so but me and my brother are such good friends
8295780 theres nothing that could ever come between us obviously its very competitive when were shooting pucks in the basement or on the backyard rink but its not like were jealous of each others accomplishments were always there to support each other its a lot smaller thing than a lot of people make it out to be me and my brother love each other a lot theres no competition between us at all
8295781 i dont mean to pump my own tires but with the way things have gone ive had a lot of things go right for me
8295782 hes had to kind of hide behind that and not get a whole lot of attention
8295783 but hes done so well i think if he wasnt my little brother he would have gotten a lot more attention for the things hes accomplished i think hes been through a lot of adversity in his career last year he had to deal with a couple of pretty serious injuries hes worked so hard and hes earned every little bit of success that hes had
8295784 i was so happy to see him get drafted especially to new york
8295785 i think its an organization thats similar to chicago thats kind of on the upper swing in the rebuilding stage he was close to coming to chicago i know chicago traded up two picks behind where he got picked i would have been pretty excited to see him come and maybe have the chance to play with me someday but at the same time i think hes got to go his own way and carve his own path hes done a great job of doing that so far
8295786 he tells me what i need to be doing to get to the next level we work hard together always pushing each other off the ice i can look at him and know what i need to do to get to the next level
8295787 tyler got hurt last year an abdominal strain in the middle of the season
8295788 otherwise he had a good year he went to the world junior tournament which was good experience for him i saw him play there tyler is a tenacious kid a very good checker hes the kind of player who wants to make things happen he gets very involved
8295789 didomenico is a diamond in the rough a typical late blooming kid and we were lucky to get him with a sixth round pick last year
8295790 we liked a lot of things he brought to the table some kids develop later than others he came out of obscurity to get invited to canadas world junior team camp thats a tribute to how far he has come
8295791 kulemin had a very good year for the russian league for sure
8295792 they dont get as many goals and assists there partly because they dont play as many games
8295793 will he be on our roster this year i think at this point the door is open for him nobody has penciled him in but the door is open the opportunity is there if he is ready and he looks like he could be ready we are a team in transition and trying to create a new culture and style of play its going to be up to him if he is ready he has already taken some of the steps he needs to take
8295794 mitchell has speed he has a shot and he is an aggressive player with a good work ethic
8295795 when he is on his game he can score and he brings good speed dale is not tall but he is not a small player at 5 foot 9 and 207 pounds he is a very stocky guy with a low center of gravity when he is going hard he is difficult to contain
8295796 frattin had a very modest year on the score sheet
8295797 he was on the third line for most of the year
8295798 were looking for him to get more ice time and be a top six forward on a regular basis wed like to see him get some power play time that is probably within his grasp
8295799 williams has the ability to score he is certainly a shooter with a knack for scoring goals
8295800 if he puts in a really good summer i dont know what his limits are he had a nice scoring streak earlier in the season and then he kind of slowed after that he can play the power play because he has offensive ability
8295801 sometimes it takes some time to become a professional and learn the pro game
8295802 robbie has taken some strides he played in nine nhl games last year he uses his speed as a weapon he has world class speed in todays game thats never a bad thing robbie got hurt at the end of the season he would have been a big help when the marlies went to the conference final
8295803 we are as thrilled with his off ice demeanor personality and character as much as we are with what he can do on the ice
8295804 anytime you can get that kind of character and leadership its a big plus whether he makes it onto our roster this year or next year he will definitely be an asset to a winning organization
8295805 luke is a big rugged physical defenseman when hes playing his best hes a very reliable player who does what it takes defensively he has good hockey sense and positions himself well he moves the puck well luke is not a big time offensive guy but he has good hands and he plays smart and simple hes not a dipsy doodle kind of player definitely not fancy he makes a good first pass hes good defensively and hes physical
8295806 becoming a professional goalie is not an easy thing and justin is certainly well on his way to becoming one
8295807 he needs to mature as a goalie and has definitely made big strides in that part of it he obviously has talent his positioning was much better this year and his composure and patience has improved thats a big part of goaltending its important not to overplay the puck and he made strides in that area
8295808 im on the same playing field as every other defenseman here
8295809 im trying to make the team and prove that i can benefit the team just as much as i hope i did last year you look around and you look at the roster and there are 16 d here every guy could be on the team you pick any eight guys and i would be confident in saying that would be one of the best d corps in the tournament next year
8295810 at the same time like you said i have a leg up on them and in a way i guess i do
8295811 its just having experience which i think is a big thing in this tournament
8295812 obviously youll take the best players but i think this group has some good size and some of the better players are pretty big kids
8295813 in order to be effective in a tournament on a nhl sheet you have to have guys that are good along the wall whether it is on the breakout or in the offensive zone and getting to the net and the areas you need to get to
8295814 its just a totally different game and you have to be able to change your game on any given night the size of a rink does make a difference especially for a guy like me a small defenseman
8295815 if were playing on an olympic sheet you cant run after guys in the corner because especially with the europeans they are too quick too shifty and they will make moves on you on the smaller rink you can close down their space and eliminate them a little easier
8295816 its something you will never forget being that close to medals and really even the gold medal
8295817 i have been a part of usa hockey for a couple of years now and even my u 18 year we lost to russia in the gold medal game and thats one that i will never forget either its completely different but at the same time its fun but looking back on the experience i wouldnt trade it for anything obviously the result wasnt what we wanted but at the same time it was a good learning experience all you can do is bottle it up and use it for the future

8295876 our colleague in ramallah was in contact with egyptian bloggers and out of that grew this regional conference
8295877 prior to the conference we sent out questionnaires to our core group of bloggers asking their opinions on discussion topics for the conference we wanted to know what they needed we didnt want to impose anything on them that they didnt want to talk about
8295878 one particularly important subject was learning from one another what to do when bloggers get into trouble
8295879 it was great because it was more of an open discussion where everyone could voice their opinion whenever they wanted to instead of long speeches
8295880 2005 and 2006 were what we in egypt called the democratic spring
8295881 the conclusion ive arrived at during the last 4 5 years is that blogging will never be an alternative to the media and the press neither in civil society nor with the political parties but again our experience in egypt has shown that we could be a spark an ignition
8295882 we have succeeded in pushing the limits of freedom of expression and talked about issues that are considered taboos such as torture womens rights and sexual assault in the streets
8295883 also farmers and workers movements are usually brutally and violently oppressed in egypt and no one would hear about it farmers land would be destroyed and they would be pushed off their lands and no one would hear about it
8295884 the state used to deny accusations of torture and claim people used the claims to clear themselves but the videos of torture and forced confessions published online have proved to be a giant leap forward
8295885 the material published on blogs has pushed the civil society to act on issues of torture womens rights workers farmers street children elections monitoring and so on we face some problems when it comes to political parties we criticize them so they consider it bad manners or defamation or competition what i would like to see is political parties stepping up to their role in the society like the blogs did when they called for democratic change plurality and honest elections
8295886 measuring the effect of blogging is difficult because there are no clear indicators in saudi arabia it is only recently that have we been able to sense some effect and i dont expect the effect to be as much as it is in egypt
8295887 the two societies are different and their cultures are different
8295888 the effect of blogs is still limited but i expect it to grow as internet users and bloggers increase the
8295889 blogs did not appear in bahrain until 2004 2005 as a result their effect is still minimal the total number of bahraini blogs is 200 to 300 blogs only forums are more popular here especially the political forums
8295890 these forums have been extremely effective in two main ways first regarding political vibrancy since bahrain witnesses political events on a daily basis this makes political forums highly influential over politics
8295891 second political forums affect political events through documented news and reports as for blogs there are none that are really influential so far in bahrain still blogging is an unprecedented phenomenon when it comes to expressing oneself especially for the youth
8295892 blogs are being used politically only to feature news such as the arrests of political activists and other stories neglected by the mainstream media this seems to be the main concern for bahraini bloggers at the moment
8295893 its difficult to determine the effect of blogs in syria especially with the absence of accurate statistics the syrian blogging experience falls behind the egyptian experience but precedes the saudi and bahraini experiences in terms of the impact it is having on society
8295894 the internet only arrived in syria in 2001 and internet users made only a small dent in the general population statistics suggest that the number of internet users in syria will reach 2 million by 2009 an unprecedented increase for people who a short while back did not even own computers
8295895 the number of bloggers is unknown but they are definitely harassing the government if this werent the case the authorities wouldnt fear them so much wouldnt block their pages or arrest the bloggers theyve handed down harsh prison sentences to scare other bloggers
8295896 as ali abdel imam said blogs are able to address issues that are not covered by the mainstream media since a free press does not exists in syria
8295897 the blogosphere is developing in syria and naturally theres been an increase in the number of bloggers also bloggers who were arrested in 2005 have returned with greater determination at times using more than one language and using rss feeds to circulate news and links to other blogs and sources documentation of the news has also increased
8295898 we do not posses accurate data on the effect of the internet on moroccan society still i am very optimistic about the effect of blogging on political life in my country
8295899 as the internet began to spread in 1996 and 1997 people did not trust it but in morocco several incidents took place that confirmed the importance of the internet
8295900 because of my blogging one minister was sacked and policemen have been discharged for accepting bribes after incriminating videos were posted online in several instances cases of human rights violations were exposed
8295901 blogging is very important in egypt first it broke the fear barrier of the egyptians second it installed fear in the hearts of the rulers who started to monitor us we also encouraged people particularly the youth to speak out express themselves and take to the streets
8295902 for me the blogging movement has been a miracle when we first started we did not know the response would be big the outcome was good and i have hope that we will persevere and remain a catalyst for the people unless something terrible happens
8295903 this question presents us with a paradox i believe bloggers are well off with time to blog and contemplate i dont mean that they are wealthy i mean they are different from those who have to work all day this is why i think its a bourgeois phenomenon
8295904 blogging started as an experiment in syria where people started using the english language as a tool of expression but i dont believe english expresses our reality in the same way as arabic
8295905 adding to that syrian blogging at first did not reflect the syrian reality today its different and syrian writers are addressing syrian issues i do not feel this has made much of a difference simply because the syrian people have not yet reached the point where they are ready to rise up and express themselves blogging is not representative of the people even the opposition in syrian is elitist from this point of view i dont consider blogging is effective in this context
8295906 censorship exists in egypt but it is selective of course websites of the muslim brotherhood the labor party and the opposition outside the country have all been blocked
8295907 but the state now adopts the idea of a liberal economy and open markets
8295908 but the interior ministry is different from the communications ministry and they do monitor the internet and have established special departments specializing in internet blogging popular movements and islamic movements online
8295909 blocking sites in egypt is easier than in other arab countries since most opposition leaders write from inside the country which makes it easy to find the persons behind a website or a blog or forum
8295910 this is exactly what happened to ahmad maher who was kidnapped on the street and tortured to surrender his facebook group password there is another side to censorship imposed on internet cafes which demands the name and identification card of internet users
8295911 whats new about censorship in egypt is that it now also targets middle and upper class cafes as well those cafes in the posh areas where people use wifi
8295912 harassing individuals takes a different form personally i have been the target of a vicious character assassination and defamation campaign i was accused on television of having a criminal record that i have converted to christianity and that i am a homosexual i have also received threats over the phone
8295913 saudi arabia already has a bad reputation when it comes to blocking websites and this is a problem the number of blocked sites is huge but internet providers have nothing to do with it the communications and technologies council is the body responsible for blocking websites in saudi arabia
8295914 the council claims that the blocking policy is clear and only targets pornographic websites
8295915 if you try to start a website and you find it blocked you have the right to contact the authorities if you think it should not be blocked by the same token you can file a complaint about a website which they will review and decide if it deserves blocking or not
8295916 we did not see much blocking of blogs blocking is not effective anymore since it became so easy to by pass it
8295917 we witnessed the first blocking with the bahrain forum in 2002 one of 22 citizen forum sites blocked by the government but people were creative in finding ways to enter the site using a proxy or virtual ip or other ways
8295918 whats funny about all this is that pornographic sites are still available
8295919 as for the blocking process itself it starts with the ministry of information who is charged with overseeing all publications they send a letter to the attorney general who in turn sends a letter to the bahrain internet exchange which issues an order to all internet providers to block the website in question many times the orders are just plain stupid as was the case with the orders to block the bahrain platform when the actual name was the bahrain forum
8295920 at the beginning hotmail and yahoo were banned we were only allowed to use mail service protocols used by the internet provider later these services were allowed but in 2006 hotmail was blocked for three months
8295921 reporters without borders rsf considers president assad one of the main enemies of press freedom
8295922 syrian internet users are very creative in bypassing proxies so the government also blocked more than 600 proxy links
8295923 a former minister of communication said that every person who writes on any website even leaving a comment must include his name phone number and email human rights watch published this order on their website the last post website did not comply and once published a comment without the required data it was blocked for 24 hours and the violation never happened again
8295924 we have a somewhat liberal system in morocco google earth is currently blocked but maps google is available there was a scandal with facebook as well we cannot talk about complete blocking more like harassment
8295925 the reporters without borders website has a page about historic violations of internet freedom in morocco some youtube pages are blocked but frankly we are in a liberal system and there is a strong economic lobby defending the internet there is massive investment from the private sector as well as commitments to open the market to foreign companies recently the third generation of internet was introduced in morocco which makes blocking even harder to impose
8295926 i would like to add another thing about the newly installed bloggers department at the state security agency and especially karim amers case he is the most famous detained blogger in egypt he was tried for adding a comment on a blog and sentenced to four years in prison for insulting the president and three more for contempt of religion still this oppression will not keep the bloggers from doing their work
8295927 banning a website is not a centralized decision and we never know where it originates this is dangerous when you dont know who is issuing a blocking order
8295928 added to that the people sometimes justify blocking certain websites popular support with detained bloggers is missing in syria it was noticed in the case of tarek al bayasi for example what the syrian government did was not just blocking websites but also spreading a culture of tolerance toward censorship and blocking of websites to me this is more dangerous
8295929 i worked incognito on various activities for two years before i started my own blog i did it because i felt my work was not reaching the syrian people it was more human rights oriented now i feel this work as well is not enough and that i have to speak about myself more as i will not tell people what to do my blog now is personal even with the ideas i propose i never try and give advice
8295930 in my case blogging made me stronger whenever i see what i think is wrong i write about it but i ran into a lot of trouble with people because im honest and do not care much what others think i will keep blogging because it is the best thing that ever happened to me
8295931 blogging is full of contradictions after i started my own blog i received many threats it was a shock i got from blogging a while back i started a company and now i work as a consultant for electronic media and advise companies on blogging as well as international organizations
8295932 i started blogging after being detained twice for reasons not related to blogging i started courageously and boldly using my full name and all but from outside the country its fair to say my experience in this field is new
8295933 what probably encouraged me was the massive number of syrian blogs also i was inspired by my brother who had a blog and was blogging from the same room i was sleeping in using the same pc i was using but i never knew he ran that blog
8295934 i discovered that blogging in syria was difficult and dangerous the bloggers inside the country are unknown and i hope i succeed in this project knowing that readers numbers of my blog are increasing every day
8295935 i started using the internet in 1996 so it was the internet that got me i dont believe blogging affected me personally much but the internet opened up new horizons of thought and i think blogging will and has opened a wider door to express my personal views
8295936 still my blog doesnt contain all my thoughts i addressed some issues like god and religion and the comments i received made me stop blogging i consider the power of the society to be savage and more powerful than the state itself but i suspect i will continue with this experience
8295937 i just wanted to enjoy myself and never expected to become part of the political scene in saudi arabia but it was a nice surprise it opened new possibilities i learned many new things and met many new people and as long as i enjoy blogging i will keep doing it
8295938 for me there have been positive and negative aspects to blogging im not sure which weighs heavier than the other in general i like what im doing and im satisfied with it and i consider it a patriotic act
8295939 as with ahmad blogging has allowed me to learn of new things and meet new people people started recognizing me and i continue to travel to new places most of what i have gained has been moral on the financial level i can assure you loses are heavy
8295940 i have been unemployed for a year and a half now in egypt i was working for a weekly egyptian magazine then i joined a foreign news agency where i was supposed to be promoted to the head of the bureau but i was sacked instead because pressure exerted from egyptian security agencies
8295941 i applied to work for a famous european radio network on three occasions and was never accepted
8295942 a 40 years old state employee was arrested in athens by the department of electronic crimes because he published in his blog threatening messages against a 48 years old journalist in addition he included defamatory comments against him more specifically the blogger called all internet users to kill the journalist and his family because he did not approve of the journalists work and the way he presented the news
8295943 police caught the blogger in the athens district of kato patissia after monitoring his online activities for several weeks the journalist mega channel s head of news christos panayiotopoulos told police a month ago that he had been the focus of malicious criticism and death threats police traced the suspect after his right to online privacy protection was lifted by a prosecutor officers said the blog contained at least 10 references to the journalist over the past three days

8295952 in 2007 there was a lot of activity with states taking the lead in moving toward health reform
8295953 in good times states expand programs and in bad economic times they scale them back
8295954 i hope that someday somebody wants to hold you for twenty minutes straight and thats all they do they dont pull away they dont look at your face they dont try to kiss you all they do is wrap you up in their arms without an ounce of selfishness in it
8295955 ubuntu needs to become synonymous with being south african and building a united south africa it is a strategic resource that south africans have barely consciously utilised
8295956 ubuntu drives community members to act in solidarity with the weak and the poor and help members of these communities to behave in particular ways for the common good
8295957 they have enough trouble dealing with their own system and now theyre meddling in ours
8295958 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
8295959 quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country
8295960 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business but its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going some place else in a much more expeditionary environment where the marine air ground task force really seems to have a true and enduring value then thats where we need to be
8295961 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
8295962 do we want to give the image of the tattooed person dancing on the table
8295963 were trying to clean up the village we have an image to protect
8295964 i wouldnt want anyone dancing on tabletops but is this something we should regulate
8295965 if a bar owner wants to subject himself to the liability of someone getting hurt thats a liability thats up to him its intrusive to an extent on the villages part
8295966 dancing on the bar youre taking away their freedom of expression
8295967 i dont think this board or this town should walk into a business and tell them how to run their business
8295968 california has been hit by the financial and housing crisis more than most states thats for sure and the unemployment rate has risen over the last year and a half
8295969 you would expect that at the end of a six year expansion incomes would have moved higher instead were going into the next downturn from a lower point than where we started at the beginning of the decade
8295970 there is tremendous wealth in california and there are pockets of california that have continued to do extraordinarily well
8295971 thats part of the story of income inequality that continues to widen in california
8295972 the fact that its so expensive to live in san francisco doesnt mean we dont have low income people as part of our community
8295973 people who work as housecleaners and busboys in the city tend to live in other places san franciscos low poverty rate doesnt mean the city is doing all the right things it could mean that san francisco is too expensive for poor people
8295974 then it takes a couple of years of growth to see poverty going down
8295975 if we worked to eradicate child poverty it would improve the lives of every one of us
8295976 we need to create more jobs and have policies that encourage firms to hire people here as opposed to moving jobs elsewhere
8295977 we need to get opportunities to people in areas that are still struggling education is part of it but so are jobs
8295978 it is not a time we can expand state benefits
8295979 this is 4 million that would have to be taken out of other state programs
8295980 we fully understand that money is an issue but we hope the governor will reconsider his decision against funding these benefits
8295981 it is a pity that there in our country the principal adornment of all women almost always consists of clothes and finery rather than knowledge
8295982 choose to be an entrepreneur because then you create value choose to be an entrepreneur because the products services and jobs you create then become the lifeblood of our nation
8295983 benefiting from high oil prices and effective cost control the companys net profit for the first half of the year increased significantly
8295984 i have to say that while this is the worst year ever for chinas petrochemical sector the worst is still not yet past
8295985 our goal was to create a new and distinctive series for jesse that is unlike anything else on television

8295987 we continue to have the focus and discipline in place to drive substantial improvement even in the midst of a very challenging consumer environment
8295988 obviously we are not satisfied with posting a loss but we clearly have this going in the right direction and are making significant progress towards our profit goals

8296013 college students show a high degree of spiritual interest and involvement three fourths say that they are searching for meaning purpose in life or that they have discussions about the meaning of life with friends and similar numbers have high expectations that college will help them develop emotionally and spiritually

8296015 students received a great deal of comfort from their spiritual religious beliefs with more than two thirds reporting that they obtained strength support and guidance from such beliefs
8296016 children shut your eyes well tell you what to see
8296017 i went to her funeral and they were singing hymns and the preacher was preaching and praying and i sat there thinking to myself that this young woman may have died unnecessarily
8296018 i think had we done that some of the issues that you have uncovered in your investigation would not be as prominent within the system today as they seem to be
8296019 senator obama feels that patients deserve more protections than the patients bill of rights not fewer
8296020 one of the real tragedies of our health care system is that people who have had health insurance have done all the right things have paid their premiums they pay their co pays when they see their doctors and when they need it most the coverage isnt there
8296021 thats whats creating a lot of anxiety in the health care system
8296022 he would change the nature of the relationship so even if an insurance company has the power to interfere they would no longer have the incentive to
8296023 the reason they intervene now is because they make money by cutting off either people or treatments and we want to people to make money by delivering good health care and thats the purpose of the reforms
8296024 one of the real complexities in the current system is that fact that we have 50 states each with their own set of regulations governing insurance
8296025 you have to fight your battles at the state level and it really makes it very complex because it means you have to fight 50 battles rather than one at the federal level
8296026 my office hears from constituents all the time who have seen insurance companies deny care have seen insurance companies do everything but march into the hospital or doctors waiting room and try to cut off their conversation
8296027 the insurance companies have been far too intrusive in violating what should be a sacrosanct doctor patient relationship
8296028 i think it could be helpful to the physician community in operating on a level playing field
8296029 i dont think they are operating on a level playing field now
8296030 it is fixable it is going to take time and it is going to take some changes
8296031 the best way to provide care for patients is to create value for patients better safety better service
8296032 and one of the main ways of doing all of this is to coordinate
8296033 thats where insurance companies could play a significant role a positive role in making part of the insurance plan a care coordination model for the patients that they insure
8296034 it is a different approach when you think of the insurer as somebody you want to partner with and somebody who wants to do a better job for their beneficiaries
8296035 im very worried about the fact that the health care conversation in america is all about putting 44 million more people into the system which is certainly all well and good for the 44 million who right now dont have reliable access
8296036 but what nobody is talking about is if the system isnt shored up with more finances and more access to providers you are just going to dilute things further and you are going to have a lot more miserable people who now are insured but the insurance isnt covering them and the waits are long and the visits are short
8296037 it seems like a very superficial election year conversation as opposed to figuring out what we are going to provide who is going to provide it and how it is going to be there when people need it i dont hear anybody taking that approach
8296038 there are now 50 and i am certain that we will shortly have even more
8296039 he finished training and he felt he had to go to harvard business school and maybe leave medicine
8296040 when i say to them why are you doing this
8296041 they have to quit moaning and get back to the business of figuring out what is the most cost effective care they can give their patients
8296042 blue collar workers are fantastic but medicine is not a blue collar job we need very creative people with a lot with great memories and ability to correlate a and b it is not a road job but thats what it is turning into
8296043 the total loss of control the corporatization the unfunded mandates big overhead thats been a frustration to most of us
8296044 a lot of things are taking away from the satisfaction of being a doctor the doctor patient relationship is the biggest
8296045 growing up in medicine i was born to believe there was a lot of tradition
8296046 microscope amp software arrived in three days well packaged amp priced

8296048 these lower workers compensation rates will have a positive impact on every segment of our marketplace
8296049 it is great news for business owners and their employees because florida employers are paying lower rates and benefits are being delivered fairly and effectively the reduction of fraud and abuse in the system is certainly paying off
8296050 to jons great credit he has drawn the new generations into the political arena in a way they have not been for the last few election cycles and the country is better off for it
8296051 i think he feels he has a constituency of young people to whom he feels a responsibility and he is trying to present issues in a satirical way but in a robust and affirmative way
8296052 the class was basically like a bunch of guys sitting around on a saturday night having a beer and making funny wisecracks
8296053 to be a psychologist which he majored in at university and then switch to comedy you have to have that veneer of political awareness and he did have a passion to be funny
8296054 he made a little deal with me that i would give him two years to try and explore what he wanted to do
8296055 so he took all kinds of weird jobs just to keep himself afloat until that point he announced he wanted to go to new york to be in comedy
8296056 his humour is biting especially when you dont know what to expect this is a very smart serious fellow

8296160 when choosing between two evils i always like to choose the one ive never tried before
8296161 it just rose out of the ground a perfect cylinder
8296162 she was about half way down the house and the ground went the other half to meet her i barely saw it myself it all happened so quick and i was watching her when she stopped moving too soon i looked around
8296163 there has to be a logical explanation for all of this
8296164 lets go have a look at this pillar okay then we can try to figure out what is going on here
8296165 bella when you jumped out the window what were you thinking
8296166 will everything is all just so new to me and it was kind of like slow motion so i was wishing that i could get to the ground faster and i did im not sure what happened
8296167 i think there is more to your power than just fire bella i think you have control over the elements around you you know like water fire earth and air i think you may be able to bend them to your will
8296168 this is very interesting ive seen this before i dont know why i didnt remember
8296169 wait youve seen somebody with the same power as me
8296170 yes his name is benjamin he recently joined my dear friend amun in egypt he has the ability to control the elements around him just as you have today
8296171 maybe i will give him a call and he can come and help you better your control
8296172 but as for right now im sure you must be in some pain so why dont you and edward go out for a little while and hunt
8296173 we have to go beyond the river and run north
8296174 alright lets get going before i ruin esmes yard anymore
8296175 we jump just like the window its simple i will go first and you follow
8296176 dont fret love im just disappointed that i still cant hear your thoughts i was hoping that maybe when you changed so would that
8296177 come on now your probably really thirst about now so lets go hunt
8296178 okay hunting is just as easy as running or jumping you just have to give yourself over to your instincts
8296179 try closing your eyes and just concentrate on the thing you smell and hear
8296180 are you done or would you like something else to satisfy your thirst
8296181 i think im done for today everything is just so overwhelming
8296182 you let her win there is no way she is faster than you even as a new born
8296183 oh a some bet him and jasper had im guessing that jasper won
8296184 oh emmett shut up i told you he didnt cheat she is just really really fast

8296189 je me rendrai en syrie les 3 et 4 septembre pour poursuivre

8296193 l encore la relation de confiance restaur e avec lautre partenaire de la paix isra l comme avec les etats unis a jou un r le majeur cest aussi parce que la syrie sait que nous avons d sormais les meilleurs rapports avec ces deux pays que damas a voulu voir la france assumer le moment venu cette responsabilit sans pr c dent

8296196 the exceptional design and location of the 40 40 club will enable our guests to access a very special race and sports book and restaurant environment in the palazzo
8296197 by adding a complete gaming component to an already distinctive 24 000 square foot space we will be able to create a very unique environment for our guests
8296198 we have developed a method that enables us to visualise fingerprints even after the print itself has been removed
8296199 for the first time we can get prints from people who handled a cartridge before it was fired wiping it down washing it in hot soapy water makes no difference and the heat of the shot helps the process we use
8296200 the procedure works by applying an electric charge to a metal say a gun or bullet which has been coated in a fine conducting powder similar to that used in photocopiers
8296201 even if the fingerprint has been washed off it leaves a slight corrosion on the metal and this attracts the powder when the charge is applied so showing up a residual fingerprint
8296202 the technique works on everything from bullet casings to machine guns even if heat vaporises normal clues police will be able to prove who handled a particular gun
8296203 the brains ability to reorganize itself is much greater than previously believed
8296204 in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight the speed and dynamic nature of the changes we observed suggest that rather than establishing new nerve connections which would take a long time the visual cortex is unveiling abilities that are normally concealed when sight is intact
8296205 in a sense by masking the eyes we unmask the brains compensatory potential
8296206 half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind
8296207 this extremely rapid adaptation indicates that functions that are normally inhibited in the brains visual cortex will come to the surface when they are needed
8296208 we believe that over time if these adaptive functions are sustained and reinforced they will eventually lead to permanent structural changes
8296209 our brain captures different types of information from the world sounds sights smells or tactile sensations
8296210 the impressions we form require us to merge these various different elements but sciences traditional view of brain function is that it is organized in separate and highly specialized systems
8296211 our study shows that these views are incorrect and illustrate the potential for the human brain to rapidly and dynamically reorganize itself
8296212 we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight and we believe that these principles may also apply to other sensory loss such as deafness or loss of function following brain injury
8296213 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in the eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
8296214 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
8296215 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
8296216 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
8296217 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
8296218 our study showed that a component of a patients blepharoplasty procedure should almost routinely involve fat excision rather than these procedures
8296219 although baggy lower eyelids are a significant result of aging and fat expansion there are other factors that can contribute too
8296220 we recommend that surgeons evaluate each component and address them accordingly in an individualized approach to blepharoplasty
8296221 the low agricultural yields diseases attacking plants mainly cassava and the influx of returning refugees at the origin of land conflicts are at the origin of the food shortage threat
8296222 to produce 12 months out of 12 months and farm low vegetation cycle crops
8296223 although we have a significant armament of therapeutic agents against hiv factors that dictate the pharmacokinetics of anti hiv drugs need to be accounted for in order to have haart efficacy in sequestered viral reservoirs several p gp inhibitors are currently under clinical trial however very little is being done to target the mrp transporters our studies using the anti hiv drugs saquinavir and zidovudine clearly implicated that inhibition of mrps rather than p gp would be a more beneficial approach to facilitate the entry of haart drugs into the sub endothelial reservoirs of hiv especially within the brain unpublished findings from our laboratory suggest that similar to mk 571 other leukotriene receptor antagonists e g montelukast singulairtm and zafirlukast accolatetm can suppress mrp mediated efflux of these anti hiv drugs as well we believe that adjunct therapy with these clinically approved mrp inhibitors may improve haart efficacy in hiv positive patients deter the selection of drug resistance and delay the progression of aids
8296224 this study by dr mondal and colleagues has crucial implications in the persistence of sub endothelial hiv reservoirs and will be important to the development of future therapies
8296225 we plan to evaluate a group of women with lam who are experiencing shortness of breath for the presence of pulmonary hypertension
8296226 we will look at participants medical history pulmonary function tests exercise tolerance echocardiogram results and previous biopsy samples
8296227 we are hopeful this information will increase our understanding of how lam can manifest in the patients it affects in the future this information may be useful in developing better management strategies for this disease
8296228 we are essentially mimicking what happens in the body when scavenger cells remove dead and abnormal cells if the dead cells are not removed then this affects how healthy cells behave
8296229 not only will this make the production of drugs more efficient but it will also streamline research into new medicines which use cell culture
8296230 we never considered that interferon alpha could be a major player in early type 1 diabetes
8296231 a normal process programmed cell death causes a normal response
8296232 but it does this in such a way that in a small subset of the population it starts them on the road to type 1 diabetes
8296233 we are greatly encouraged by our findings because the nearly half of the children on the diet were either able to maintain healthy cholesterol or gradually metabolized the extra fat and returned to somewhat normal cholesterol levels
8296234 this means the benefits of the diet a diet that is lifesaving in many children and therapeutic in most of them continue to outweigh the risks
8296235 the take home message for women is that whether you are hooked on caffeine or not if you need a boost coffee improves your mental alertness and can have a calming affect on your heart rate
8296236 in addition a large coffee has more than enough caffeine to see these changes
8296237 this indicates that there may be some long term cardiovascular adjustment to digesting caffeine on a daily basis
8296238 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example
8296239 the language centre of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain
8296240 this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently

8296246 what impressed me the most is that everything went by the book
8296247 species invasions and extinction the future of native biodiversity on islands
8296248 the presumption at the time was that we are driving biodiversity to lower levels
8296249 certainly if you think about it at the global level this is true because humans have done a lot of things that have driven species extinct
8296250 what dov and i worked on a few years ago is the fact that the vast majority of introductions of species dont have large negative effects
8296251 indeed most species that get introduced dont have much effect at all it doesnt mean that theyre not altering the ecosystem but theyre not driving things extinct like some of the big poster child stories weve been hearing about
8296252 the dramatic increase in the number of species has changed how the system functions
8296253 changing the abundance of natives versus exotics affects all of the other species that used to depend on the natives for food or shelter so its not in any way to say that increasing biodiversity is a good thing
8296254 that by going in and mucking up the system we may have already created the setting where too many species have been packed in and we just havent waited long enough to see these extinctions start to happen
8296255 the whole point of this study was to start looking down the path to see which of these wildly different scenarios might be right
8296256 we havent nailed the answer yet but weve set the stage for answering whether islands are now saturated or not
8296257 it was very surprising to find such a strong correlation between the number of native and exotic plant species on islands around the world
8296258 in ecological research a strong correlation often explains 50 percent of the variation here the correlation between native and exotics explains almost 100 percent of the variation in other words if you know how many native plants are on an oceanic island then you can predict almost perfectly how many exotic plants are there
8296259 which means islands that are far enough away from a continent that theyre not getting regular exchanges with the mainland

8296276 nosotros respetamos todas las opiniones pero siempre que nos respeten a nosotros

8296288 we know this for all sorts of behavior in kids you dont tell kids to do one thing and then do something else kids very quickly pick up on it when their parents arent practicing what theyre preaching
8296289 you can really put them in a room full of unhealthy food somehow theyre going to find a way to eat healthy

8296333 though that character was very different from walter bishop we thought theres a series about a guy like this
8296334 i actually dont think of them as fans the people who are into those shows are also fans of the shows that i am interested in
8296335 what a night this has been an extremely spirited and hard fought primary and now it appears as if we wont know the results until sometime wednesday at the earliest there are several precincts still to be counted and an additional 4 000 republican absentee ballots once these ballots are counted lt gov parnell and i will be able to determine what course our campaigns will take
8296336 im confident the final results will give us a primary victory and we can move on to the general election
8296337 we have not found willing partners on the other side of the table

8296343 for sure i received calls from england to ask me about my situation in september
8296344 i just spoke with my agent luis aparicio and saying i did with wigan or whatever other club is a lie
8296345 moreover mexican clubs called me but at this hour moving clubs seems difficult
8296346 both sen john mccain and sen barack obama are poker players but neither one has expressed anything one way or the other regarding the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act
8296347 its pretty low on their radar for poker players i really dont think theres much difference between the candidates
8296348 i guess if the criminals arent breaking down the door you arent going to get one
8296349 whether i personally have a ccw isnt the big issue
8296350 but its a barometer of where we are on our freedoms and constitutional rights the 2nd amendment shouldnt stop when i go out my front door
8296351 you will see the number of ccws drop quite a bit
8296352 we are heading out to the build site where we are building four homes with habitat for humanity through the jimmie johnson foundation its an exciting day my wife and i are all dressed up and ready to have a good day
8296353 some weekends i feel like we have a dominant car and other weekends i feel like were a fifth place car or even a 10th place car
8296354 with the strong team that we have we seem to be able to rally back and get finishes out of it so i still think that we may be behind and especially where we want to be we want a nice cushion and we want to be well ahead of the competition and without a doubt we are not there
8296355 we are on par if maybe just not a little bit behind right now we have been testing already this week and been working as hard as we possibly can to find more speed and to better understand this car every time we are on track we learn something and we can apply it
8296356 im excited for this weekends race and we were a little smarter yesterday in the test session that we had and hopefully we can bring that out to california this weekend
8296357 we showed up at vegas and fontana at the start of the season with what we thought was the best downforce package on the planet
8296358 california went well we were slow all weekend but went with the 24 of jeff gordons setup and it ran well then we went to vegas with the latest greatest moves and the stuff we thought was going to work based on the old car and we were not even in the same race we were out there seven cylinder class it seemed like that has been the hardest part to find out where to work and thats what weve done all season long
8296359 there is not anyone smarter than chad but the way he has thought about setting these cars up and what we have done in the past does not work with this new car
8296360 we are trying to find the right direction in the right areas to turn him loose and let him work there are not any big areas anymore its a lot of small areas and we are now i feel getting the rhythm of this car and understanding what to work on
8296361 its a lot closer to equal to what we have now so i think its a great opportunity
8296362 we get into the final 10 and its great tracks for myself and the 48 team add comment
8296363 how do other countries handle acquiring land for such use do you think were truly beyond getting an infrastructure in place

8296368 some secreted proteins may truly lack secretory signal peptides since they are subject to leaderless protein secretion similarly it cannot be excluded at present that transchromosomal chimeras can be formed and may have normal physiological functions
8296369 the fact that mispred analyses of protein sequences of the swiss prot database identified very few such exceptions indicates that the rules of mispred are generally valid
8296370 im elated i dont know what to say in congratulating our gallant countrymen and women
8296371 they have really done a lot in portraying a positive image of our country abroad
8296372 this goes to show that we as kenyans are able to sort out our own problems and move on
8296373 the athletes have hit the ground running literary and have been our great ambassadors in beijing
8296374 the chinese have a lot to learn from our athletics training methods and we also have a great deal to learn from their sports success we are already talking and we hope to implement some of the ideas we have soon
8296375 we have received overwhelming support from the government corporate organisations and individuals and it is these actions that have spurred our athletes on to their performances at the olympics
8296376 the biggest thing he brings to the ticket is he is qualified to be president of the united states
8296377 everybody when they talk about potential vice presidential candidates they put them in different categories here is one that can help the ticket by delivering a state here is one that can help the ticket by delivering an interest group but they always talk about joe biden he is the one who if something happens to barack obama he is qualified and i think that what is says about barack obama he is not in this thing to win this he is in this to make america a better place and a better place in the world
8296378 biden should and probably will go after john mccain and the republicans hard
8296379 if he does not and its a mild mannered presentation i think the delegates will leave very disappointed
8296380 everyone is going to be measuring every word that clinton says because it is very well known that he has been unhappy with obama some have said that he has been pouting
8296381 he and his people have certainly been leaking quite a number of crucial comments from clinton about obama so his words will be weighed carefully and he will come through he knows he is under the microscope he will be very enthusiastic while the cameras are on
8296382 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8296383 it satisfies this desire to take responsibility for our waste
8296384 i dont know if people have noticed this but we are a rich community

8296397 in good times states expand programs and in bad economic times they scale them back

8296406 for the first two to three weeks my dad was the stalwart of the family he was the person my mum turned to for reassurance and kept her going but now that its all over with hes gone into a bit of a regression hes been getting mental flashbacks about what happened to the two of them

8296429 im not going to vote for obama im not going to vote for mccain either
8296430 we love her but its our vote if we dont trust him or dont like him
8296431 if someone rides up to a convenience store with a sawed off shotgun and a prior record im not intimidating anybody by calling the cops if this republican campaign is going to be run in mccarthyite fashion by lawbreakers in an illegal way they are going to pay a price
8296432 why would barack obama be friends with somebody who bombed the capitol and is proud of it

8296448 mark steven johnson who brought daredevil and ghost rider to the big screen told the continuum that his attempts to bring garth ennis preacher to hbo as a series were close but ultimately unsuccessful
8296449 we were budgeting and everything and it was getting really close to going
8296450 but the new head of hbo felt it was just too dark and too violent and too controversial which of course is kind of the point
8296451 it was a very faithful adaptation of the first few books nearly word for word they offered me the chance to redevelop it but i refused ive learned my lesson on that front and i wont do it again so im afraid its dead at hbo
8296452 ive heard someone is in the process of getting the rights to turn it into a feature film i hope that happens but i hope it happens as a series of movies as one movie couldnt do it justice i really love that story and i dedicated a lot of my time to honor garths work but it wasnt meant to be

8296460 sir we are here today debating the nature of democracy in singapore democracy is about the people about how they have the power and the people have spoken they have spoken their voice rings loud and clear and they want a by election
8296461 in other words who calls the by election is it the pm or the mp with this motion the power to call a by election is placed in the hands of one mp whether in the grc or smc single member constituency i do not understand our laws to extend such privileges to any single member whether minority or otherwise

8296539 the horrors of the second world war gave impetus to a quest for universal peace justice and human dignity with the united nations at the fore it is a disturbing commentary on our quest that as we commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights palestinians mark six decades of what they refer to as the nakba or catastrophe with many languishing in conditions of exile exclusion and isolation this is a testament to our collective failure to give meaning to human dignity for palestinians and to achieve a lasting just peace in the middle east we who serve palestine refugees believe that there is time to make amends exile for sixty years palestine refugees have been in exile from their ancestral lands nowhere is this more starkly visible than in the west bank where the illegal barrier hundreds of checkpoints and physical obstructions daily reinforce the exile and in gaza the policies of closure and indiscriminate punishment devastate lives causing mass despair threatening to destroy hopes for peace exclusion palestine refugees also face exclusion from the justice afforded by international law the aim of which is to offer the protection security and dignity taken for granted in a world where respect for human rights and the rule of law have become guiding principles of global governance embodied in the canons of international law are clear prohibitions against systematic attacks against civilian populations against deliberately depriving civilians of food against the intentional destruction of civilian infrastructure and against the transfer of an occupying powers population onto the land it occupies the violations of these and other provisions serve to underscore among palestinians a sense of exclusion from the protection of the international system

8296547 when a wednesday which addresses itself to an issue thats close to mr modi as a politician was ready i wanted him to watch it i called him and requested him to do so
8296548 mr modis counter request was tell me the story in two lines i told him he immediately agreed then his staff got into action and a date was set
8296549 it the screening went off fabulously let me tell you media perceptions of mr modi are completely wrong he is misunderstood because he is outspoken he is a politician destined for very big things the good thing was he came with no prejudices and he brought his entire ministry and government machinery with him
8296550 its very important for us actors to come forward and help a film thats done with sincerity of purpose and has got a message behind it

8296559 he could not throw the ball down field and we were hesitant to run him too because we didnt want to risk losing him for an extended period of time but hes someone when healthy capable of being our most dangerous offensive playmaker
8296560 ideally wed use brian like rich rodriguez used pat white though in our own way
8296561 hes a guy that can make every pass and has to be accounted for on every play because of his ability to make things happen with his feet
8296562 you never like to say you have to throw for this much or run for this much but i think what i did my freshman year im capable of doing again
8296563 but i dont think my coaches would be happy if i was the same player that i was in 2005

8296573 no one ever predicted that clownfish would be attracted to the scent of leaves i just figured they might like beach water
8296574 i saw the islands had heavy vegetation and i said lets give it a shot
8296575 this shows that you cant separate the marine and terrestrial environments you have to consider them working together
8296576 i would really like to see if this is happening in other fish
8296577 its really easy to speculate that without the leaves clownfish might not be able to find their homes
8296578 off any island therell be eddies and currents that pull leaves out a fair ways from islands
8296579 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development

8296624 for the 39 years of our marriage my husband always pulled out his key and opened the door when we returned from an evening out during the day i left the door unlocked we had a doorman
8296625 i could use a sharp infusion of feminist pride a sense of my own power a disinterest in attachment a venturesome soul daring to walk my own path
8296626 he told me that customs had changed since i was a girl and asked me if i understood what was expected in todays dating world
8296627 his hand was on my knee his other hand was stroking my arm up and down as if it were a horses nose we had known each other for exactly twenty five minutes
8296628 i think it doesnt matter that he is a lutheran and i am jewish those distinctions belong to another time of life but then he says that his life was changed by dr phil i dont respond the conversation ends
8296629 lets seize the moment lets take advantage of what time we have
8296630 widowhood as i am now growing accustomed to it can be a calm place
8296631 this is the next to last step in a systematic succession plan weve had in place for some time now
8296632 but its still an announcement that comes with a lot of mixed emotions when you consider the integral role that bb amp t has played in my life for nearly 40 years now
8296633 allows two powerful properties to work together to create a more seamless television viewing experience for their respective audiences
8296634 we had two messages for tesco one farmers will not subsidise a price war between retailers two we dont believe in farmers having to sign intrusive contracts where they have to release sensitive and personal information to retailers and others i think theyve got that message loud and clear
8296635 tesco has said it will not drop the price it pays to farmers but this reduced retail milk prices could not come at a worse time
8296636 the general feeling is that we need about 2 5p litre more on farmgate prices in the next few months but were now in a corner and tesco has knocked the industry quite flat by starting a price war confidence had increased but the industry is now at a low ebb
8296637 we introduced freshnlo for our customers to help ease the financial pressure some are facing it doesnt affect the farmgate price offered through our dairy development group
8296638 we have committed and will continue to be committed to dairy farmers but we have to recognise the situation our customers are in and we are working to strike a balance we offer the highest farmgate milk price of any retailer and have supported farmers through our localchoice milk as well
8296639 its important for us to get an understanding of our producers and what is affecting them and its fair for us to ask for that information
8296640 the wheat is looking alright we havent seen any sprouting and its all standing up still
8296641 our spring barley is ready but we want to cut it below 16 moisture
8296642 we were very lucky we had rain at all the right time for the spring barley this year
8296643 its a beautiful sunny afternoon and the winds blowing but when i look at the moisture meter it is 23 where its been all day
8296644 it is very wet and crops have suffered a bit
8296645 bushelweights are good but theres quite a high percentage of screenings
8296646 where most of the wheat is grown quality is pretty good
8296647 but the bulk of the wet weather has come from the west side and hagbergs there are deteriorating
8296648 if the drier weather stays until the weekend i think a lot of farmers will get themselves squared up in the east
8296649 its looking good its standing reasonably well although it does have a little bit of sprouting
8296650 the situation is now quite clear the united states can no longer hide its truculence under the mask of weather fluctuations or unclear science islands are disappearing indigenous ways of life are threatened indeed the world as we know it is at risk if the us continues to do nothing therefore a drastic cut in emissions is necessary this can be accomplished by using the tax code to incentivize behavior from retrofitting buildings demanding new standards for all new construction utilizing existing technologies and developing new ones to subsidizing infrastructure rehabilitation not only can the us reverse its deadly inaction but it can become a world class leader the us could declare itself carbon and nuclear free it has not the urgency of the situation has been made clear by many popular articles and films the next step is to create the political will to change course
8296651 i keep reading it but the sands of time are running out and there is no approach
8296652 clubs know we have no interest in doing any business there so i presume thats why they havent bothered
8296653 obviously it would appeal to many but he is not available its very straightforward
8296654 americans have a remarkable talent for creating transparently pointless political rituals
8296655 phallic fornication machine we think we saw one of those at a frat party once
8296656 in america you always keep going were americans were not big on quitting
8296657 weve got to ensure that the choice we make in this election honors the sacrifices of all who came before us and will fill the lives of our children with possibility and hope

8296676 its like jen is on nothing less than a revenge tour
8296677 while in the past jen shunned publicity and shrank from photographers lenses now shes openly encouraging the attention smiling showing off her body and creating photo ops
8296678 jen was glowing smiling and being very friendly as she ate tuna tartare rock shrimp and spinach salad with a glass of wine it was hard to believe this was a woman who just broke up with her boyfriend
8296679 a new human resource information system can save you tremendous amounts of time and make you and your staff far more effective at your job but it is important to understand work will be required to maintain the database and maximize results
8296680 rarely will you have the capability of importing benefits data or history so its important to understand that this data will have to be manually input the majority of the time
8296681 any data that you cant import or that is not available in another system will have to be manually input as well
8296682 the advantage of an interface is that it can save tremendous amounts of time associated with manual entry
8296683 that saved time can mean the difference between a helpful product that your employees use and one that they abandon because its too cumbersome if you are using one system for hr and a different product for payroll make sure you have an interface for transferring data included in the scope of the project
8296684 interfaces and a good implementation can assist with this but additional work is always required
8296685 for example all of your code tables for job titles department titles and benefits codes will be created at setup but there will eventually be additions and changes to this information
8296686 i was never anorexic so i was never that skinny
8296687 doing shows and flying economy nobody ever fed me or id be staying in hotels so cheap that by the time id get in there wasnt any room service
8296688 i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose
8296689 youd be on shoots with bad food or get on a plane and the food would be so disgusting you couldnt eat it
8296690 you go to a show and theres no food at all so if youre doing shows back to back you can forget eating
8296691 i remember standing up in the bath one day and there was a mirror in front of me and i was so thin i hated it i never liked being that skinny

8296700 we have established that an incorrect zone was entered against this booking by an operator
8296701 this led to the first back up vehicle being directed towards collingtree
8296702 the crew of the second back up vehicle received the same information but the error was recognised and they were able to divert to the correct location
8296703 its a dangerous scenario we have lots of local sayings such as welly road or kingsley front
8296704 these places wont come up on the maps and sat navs and unless you know what the caller means you wont know where to send the ambulance
8296705 in northamptonshire we reach about 80 of life threatening situations within eight minutes ahead of government targets
8296706 we wont know whether the move will be a success until we see how the new figures compare but i have my doubts
8296707 if you want to keep your job after im elected
8296708 representative borror has a strong background in all of the critical matters that come before the state budget committee
8296709 his legislative and business background will be an asset to the committee
8296710 its a great honor to be appointed to this most important committee by leader bosma and an honor to follow in the footsteps of rep larry buell
8296711 i look forward to working with the state budget committee at this critical time in indianas history and i am anxious to get to work
8296712 he has demonstrated leadership while serving in the general assembly and he will be a strong voice for the citizens of indiana
8296713 sign posted right in front of you had you only been paying attention it could have been so much easier
8296714 an russlands wto beitritt sind doch vor allem europ ische gesch ftsleute interessiert die sich davon bessere rahmenbedingungen f r den handel mit russland versprechen

8296716 were dealing with a woman getting into her 40s who is wondering if thats all there is its about the subtle parts of family relationships
8296717 we should not tolerate underperformance it damages students irreversibly and it fails families
8296718 within three years parents will have a report that shows not just how their child is doing but how their childs school is performing compared to similar schools
8296719 i believe that when australians know our country they will prefer our country instead of bali for example
8296720 we want to increase from 10 australians a year to 100 a month
8296721 it is the cleanest water in the world the most beautiful corals what i saw there was the red fish clown fish made popular by the movie finding nemo we too have nemo
8296722 and the reason i am is because protection like that ultimately doesnt help consumers particularly working families who are struggling to get the best deal possible with a very large purchase
8296723 there has been a general flow of manufacturing jobs to the us since the free trade agreement was signed by the former government
8296724 victoria needs to protect local industry and make sure that we retool for the global manufacturing sector
8296725 if you look at the production graphs for workplaces like this often you will see redundancies following fairly quickly on the heels of a tariff reduction
8296726 we say a proposed halving of the domestic tariff is a ridiculous idea when our trading partners have significantly higher tariffs and the australian dollar is strong
8296727 we believe there will be a significant number of component suppliers that will be announcing reductions as a consequence of the reduced manufacturing schedule of companies like ford and so on every time a large car company reduces its workforce you see these kinds of announcements in the supply chain
8296728 ive got two young kids three and five and a mortgage and all the bills and everything else that goes along with that
8296729 as far as i can see all the automotive jobs are pretty much getting close to dried up
8296730 i might have to go get a job at maccas or somewhere
8296731 i was nervous but there was also an adrenalin rush when i went out there
8296732 i really wanted bold colours and yellow is just a colour i associate with summer
8296733 i have noticed a real difference in petrol and food
8296734 for the first time the other day i spent 600 on groceries which might last two weeks
8296735 and for the first time we are paying only interest on our mortgage everything is getting really hard
8296736 its business for them thats all anyone cares about these days
8296737 i know stephanie and eamon are very disappointed that happened
8296738 were happy if ms gunn wants to come forward and well get something signed
8296739 chanting music no electric lighting the whole atmosphere was one of sedation
8296740 the college needs to take more drastic action than it has to date the vincentians should withdraw themselves from the governing council of the college while the investigation is ongoing
8296741 these measures will send a clear message to the world canada takes its responsibilities seriously for environmental protection and enforcement in our arctic waters
8296742 a fire broke out in the military store near the town of lozovaya we are taking steps to localise the blaze the size of which we are checking
8296743 but the recognition of these unrecognised republics will without doubt stick in the minds of a lot of people in the north caucaus
8296744 in chechnya there is still separatist sentiment so a precedent will be set if one lot of people can have it then why cant the others it will have an impact
8296745 russia shouts about western double standards at the top of its voice but does not have the slightest hesitation to use the same method
8296746 they called what had happened a genocide it is very hurtful and funny to observe all this from the point of view of people who went through the complete destruction of a nation and on top of that were called a nation of bandits
8296747 inaction by russia on the georgian regions would have been absolutely not understood least of all by the population of the north caucasus
8296748 it has become clear that russia in the north caucasus is strong and it is prepared to act including with arms without taking account of anyones opinion
8296749 to make their best efforts to contain further outbreaks of lawlessness which could contribute to additional displacement
8296750 the high costs will influence farmers to plant less it is difficult to predict by how much now
8296751 it is highly unlikely that they will be able to charge that amount and recover the money so farmers are going to plant less
8296752 farmers dont use roads a lot they do most of their commuting on farm roads
8296753 we are not asking for any input subsidy but they could perhaps subsidise the premiums
8296754 this is a step in the right direction towards ensuring wheat production and food availability which in turn could mean lower bread prices
8296755 it is really wonderful to see olympic athletes expressing solidarity with refugees who often spend years languishing in bleak camps around the world
8296756 for the refugees these are not only useful items of clothing but a symbol that people in the world beyond the refugee camps especially famous athletes from the olympics care about them
8296757 ive wanted to do something for refugees ever since i saw them in a movie
8296758 though the work is tiny i enjoy it very much
8296759 if there is a chance to do more for refugees i would like to do it
8296760 the low agricultural yields diseases attacking plants mainly cassava and the influx of returning refugees at the origin of land conflicts are at the origin of the food shortage threat
8296761 to produce 12 months out of 12 months and farm low vegetation cycle crops
8296762 five weeks ago relief organisations were not a target of attacks in this area now things have changed
8296763 there are more than 80 humanitarian organisations here and you have to admire them for their determination to stay in the face of everything from bureaucratic obstacles to attacks
8296764 somalia is really at a stage where the situation is getting increasingly acute and a cause for major concern
8296765 within the first six months of this year the number of people requiring emergency livelihood and humanitarian support increased 77 percent from 1 83 million to 3 25 million affecting 43 percent of the entire population of the country
8296766 one in six children under the age of five is acutely malnourished and the number is continuing to increase
8296767 more and more people from the rural and urban areas are falling into acute food and livelihood crisis and humanitarian emergency
8296768 as they cannot cope with the compounding shocks of conflict drought and hyperinflation many of the poor and middle households are becoming severely indebted and are adopting extreme coping strategies including reducing food consumption skipping meals splitting families selling productive assets and out migrating known locally as keynaan
8296769 threatening to plunge the country into an even greater humanitarian disaster
8296770 joining our main cast are some fantastic guest artists who will only add to making this unmissable tv
8296771 it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as it is great and fantastic
8296772 im not against it so long as it never gets in the way of the tv show if it got in the way of the show that would be appalling
8296773 candidate x agrees with you on everything but cant deliver candidate y agrees with you on half of the topics but you believe he can deliver
8296774 for the future of the human race against the fiercest force they have encountered
8296775 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride
8296776 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
8296777 the last time i was here i was performing at the grand which is always fantastic and i actually performed as the invisible man
8296778 i really love coming to the old place because the people are fantastic and they are always so enthusiastic theres been a doctor who museum here for years and the love for the show around here is amazing
8296779 hes bringing a real new lease of life to the role and i think hes
8296780 its a real pleasure to have such a living legend here
8296781 hes a massive part of doctor who history and hes a lovely guy to boot
8296782 last year new crop cottonseed in the mid south was 155 per ton in late july this year it was 310
8296783 weve seen a significant loss of tonnage as seed per bale at gins has dropped from 800 pounds to 700 pounds or less this particularly hurts when cottonseed prices are as high as they are now for 25 000 bales ginned the dollar impact is some 375 000
8296784 try and get cottonseed companies to breed back some additional seed size and weight into their varieties
8296785 and some dairies have taken cottonseed out of their rations
8296786 most dairies seem to be handling higher feed costs fairly well with higher prices for milk offsetting the increases some of the more highly leveraged operations may see trouble though
8296787 were getting requests for quotes on thousands of tons for overseas shipments but not much business has materialized because of shortage of supply and high transportation costs
8296788 we hope the higher prices for cottonseed will influence the planting of more cotton as producers and ginners look at the total value of cotton and not just the fiber
8296789 if you dont comply with these very complex regulations you could face some serious problems
8296790 you need to be very careful who has your wallet and check writing authority because you can be held responsible
8296791 significant fines with criminal sanctions likely after the first violation
8296792 just about all soybeans in the sugarcane rotation have been harvested but there are still beans out there ready to be harvested
8296793 a farmer can watch a field go from being a profitable situation to a financial loss fairly quickly because of unfavorable weather conditions were not there yet but there are plenty of anxious producers out there
8296794 the wind from the storm caused some cane to lodge in isolated areas but it was not that significant
8296795 first thing in the morning we will present research behind feed efficiency and then later we will show the technology
8296796 the beef farm is located behind the komu tv tower on highway 63 south of columbia
8296797 turn east on old millers road just south of the radar dome at the station the farm sign and entrance are just behind the tower

8296799 wir erwarten daher dass s chsische npd mitglieder beim brandenburgischen kommunalwahlkampf dabei sein werden
8296800 russia has not reconciled itself to the new map of this new region we do not want a new cold war and he medvedev has a big responsibility not to start one
8296801 we need to raise the costs to russia for disregarding its responsibility
8296802 we need to re examine the nature depth and breadth of relations with russia
8296803 the cps wishes to make it clear that this prosecution was not an attack upon the practices or ceremonies of shia muslims indeed the prosecution relied as part of its evidence upon the president of the local shia community centre
8296804 this man not only abused the vulnerability of these children but also went against the wishes of his own community as well as knowingly breaking the law
8296805 weve been testing the waters with a lot of different closed loop recycling events in ever increasing scale and size
8296806 they play their music loud though so they want a condo thats soundproof
8296807 ella a a right there yes yes better hurry up
8296808 he played for me in the 1980s in hamilton alongside grover covington and helped grover become the cfls all time sack leader
8296809 mikes been with washington state the past decade and brings a great deal of expertise on the defensive line were excited to utilize his knowledge to help us in our quest for a grey cup
8296810 as market conditions and practices evolve the system has to be reviewed to ensure that it is still being used for its intended purpose and does not accommodate undesirable practices
8296811 i dont think theres going to be some major fundamental change there will be some modifications at the margin the review is still underway there are no hard and fast decisions yet
8296812 we are monitoring banks use of the collateral framework very closely
8296813 the collateral that we take must also be traded in the market because only then is it priced accurately
8296814 we aim at taking final decisions in autumn which will be communicated immediately
8296815 in times of stress there will always be attempts made to stretch the interpretation of the rules
8296816 there has been evidence of attempts to issue securities designed to fit the eligibility criteria with the aim of obtaining liquidity from the eurosystem
8296817 hopefully im past the stage of justifying my ryder cup potential or otherwise
8296818 everybody knows and im sure i speak for the captain as well my love of the ryder cup and thats how i will be remembered if you like
8296819 the ryder cup has brought the best out of me everybody tells me why dont you just play the way you in the ryder cup
8296820 as tom lehman said in america wed be delighted if monty is not playing i think that says a lot
8296821 to get selected i think ive got to show some form i havent become a bad player im just sort of out of form and have been for the last month
8296822 but i feel very much more confident having had a weeks holiday away from the game and after practising here last week
8296823 there is no resignation in any way shape or form of that ryder cup qualification
8296824 i just felt i wanted to turn my game around and the best way to do that was to practice up here and prepare for this event the way that i have
8296825 none at all and ive no idea how he feels i need to perform i will do the best i can as i always do and then ill go home on sunday and watch on television
8296826 if dont qualify id consider getting my game ready to make sure i do make it in 2010
8296827 dad why cant the rays of the sun reach the forest in patagonia
8296828 you must not ask questions like that my son tamilat is a very powerful god you must never ignite his wrath
8296829 but why dad doesnt the forest need the rays of the sun why does tamilat obscure the sun with his dark clouds
8296830 you will not stop asking questions will you my dear boy even though tamilat is a god he is not perfect us gods also have flaws and make mistakes therefore you must not judge tamilat
8296831 you see son tamilat has a weakness he cannot control his thundering temper he is also a very jealous god amelia is very beautiful and he doesnt want any other god to see her beauty therefore he blocks out the rays of the sun with his dark clouds and at the same time he is destroying her once beautiful forest so that she cannot be seen and her beauty is disfigured
8296832 i long for the one day when i had known true love my dear
8296833 why cant you have your love back mother who was it my father
8296834 oh but she can your mother can be with her love and you can be with your father
8296835 devil woman is that what you call me you you who had slept like a whore with galedeus while you were married to tamilat
8296836 never never is a long time you are a goddess you know unless you are killed by a god or goddess you will not die do you want to live here with your daughter in this rotting dark swamp forever
8296837 i will not make a pact with the devil go now and never come back here
8296838 i will come back again to tell you about the special night i had spent in bed with galedeus neither man nor god can withstand my charm and beauty i will seduce galedeus i will sleep with him and make him love me then you will have nothing left galedeuss love for you will be dead you have seven days to decide let me know before then if you want to help me and then i will tell you what i have in mind
8296839 i will make a plan iris i promise lets not talk about that devil woman for now we need to rest
8296840 iris my loving daughter you are a goddess you are still young and it is with a deep ache in my heart that i will place this burden on your shoulders
8296841 i will take this mirror to ra i will plead and beg with him to use the mirror to reflect the rays of the sun from the light side of the earth through a crack in the clouds into the forest when it is dark here
8296842 but how are you going to get to ra mother
8296843 i must ask you to use your power as a goddess you are the daughter of galedeus you can travel by gliding on the colours of the rainbow
8296844 you must use your power to send me on the light of the stars during the night
8296845 but the light of the stars are white and a rainbow cannot appear during the night mother
8296846 with your power you can let me travel with the white light
8296847 the light of the stars are not strong enough only one of us can go
8296848 then i will use all my strength to get you to ra mother
8296849 thank you iris you will be a great goddess now let us wait for the night and an opening in the clouds
8296850 you must please take the mirror and reflect the rays of the sun tomorrow night into the forest so that my daughter can escape
8296851 but dad amelia said her daughter is still back at the forest
8296852 use the mirror to reflect the rays of the sun then her daughter must be the child of galedeus thats the only explanation amelia wants her daughter to use the rays of the sun and when the rainbow appears she must glide out of the forest
8296853 the curse yes of course a god or goddess cannot use the white light of the moon or stars to travel and stay alive
8296854 tamilat is the most powerful of the gods no god can go against him the mere act of amelia escaping on the white light of the stars will cause tamilat to declare war against those who helped her we cannot let anybody know amelia escaped even though she had died
8296855 she died dad amelia died thats exactly why we must use the mirror to help her daughter we cannot let her daughter suffer any longer amelia gave her life so that her daughter can be saved doesnt that mean anything
8296856 son you are a grown man now you now have a will of your own i cannot go against you go and get my armour for as soon as you use that mirror there will be war we must either defeat tamilat or we will die ourselves that is the way it will be
8296857 i will go to war amelia died for her daughter and i am prepared to fight and die for you let that be my honour
8296858 child your mother gave her life for you you have the power to send someone away on the rays of light but to survive the journey it must be refracted light like a rainbow your mother knew she would die after traveling on the white light but that was her only way to save you
8296859 i never would have let her go if i knew
8296860 son go to galedeus and tell him he is either with us or against us he must go to war he owe it to his daughter the clouds over the forest are moving away tamilat must have seen the rainbow on which iris traveled
8296861 i will go father i will recruit the other gods those who are against us i will fight
8296862 my sword is sharp and filled with the heat of the sun i will comfort the child and when the battle starts i will be one of the first to meet tamilat
8296863 i am the daughter of galedeus and amelia the messenger of the gods and goddess of the rainbow my first message to you is to stop fighting tamilat is dead
8296864 i am your messenger a few of you will be able to talk to one another many of you will need me the messenger that is my burden as well because i will have to carry the messages i will pay for the sin of my mother and you will pay for looking the other way when tamilat abused my mother
8296865 i have received this message from our creator from now on the rainbow will appear when it rains while the sun is shining to remind you all of this bloody battle such a battle will never happen again those who had died even tamilat will from now on be the guardians of the rainbow

8296968 during times when economic conditions are volatile companies step up efforts to stress the importance of purchasing tickets in advance in order to use discount tickets in a negotiated travel program
8296969 our data shows that during the second quarter of 2008 89 percent of tickets purchased were domestic discount coach fares this shows that more travelers purchased tickets in advance these subtle changes can translate into significant savings 17 percent or more in some cases looking at the first six months of 2008 the companies that had travelers purchase 8 14 days in advance rather than 0 7 days in advance saved an average of 49 per segment
8296970 as globalization continues to pull business travelers to international destinations we advise our clients to focus on international travel policy compliance

8296979 equipped with kodak scanners our scan squads are nothing short of everyday superheroes for protecting and managing information to assure streamlined access and optimal business continuity
8296980 we are able to quickly respond to very specific customer needs whether they are focused on turnaround times budgets or diverse document types
8296981 in the case of a major national retail client the retailer came to us with an entire portfolio of documents that was estimated at 7 million pages

8296989 if a carrier can execute its advertising strategy well and overcome the key challenges it could move quickly to reap the benefits
8296990 carriers can expect to become an integral part of consumers lifestyles when they can reliably deliver relevant advertisements to them this will require closer cooperation and partnerships with other businesses such as retailers restaurants and cinemas

8297024 cant get overly excited by a down in the situation right now because this process does go up and down
8297025 it was clear to me that they did not have an adequate knowledge of the various powers of when a warrant was required and of the circumstances in which they could act without one

8297051 putting a tax on the electricity companies means they would lose money at a time when we need to spend 100billion on replacing old power stations over the next 11 years every pound taken from the companies would have to be raised by them elsewhere in the credit crisis that is difficult enough but a raid on electricity companies bank accounts would send out a very unfortunate signal to the world of investment
8297052 the signal we are getting from government is that they are not minded to impose a windfall tax per se of the sort that was brought in after the 1997 election
8297053 if you take money out of the companies and they have to find it somewhere else then their investment costs will go up and customers will have to bear the brunt of that
8297054 there has been no windfall many of the retail arms of power companies have struggled to make money and have held down their prices to customers while wholesale prices have soared

8297394 i was more comfortable behind the mask than naked like this perlman says during an interview in a beverly hills hotel
8297395 the make up made me freer because it was no longer me it was a transformed version of me it made acting more possible
8297396 these days i am comfortable in my own skin the deep voiced actor says quietly
8297397 i dont need the mask as much as i used to i just consider myself to be a working stiff who has just had a lot of great opportunities i just take every job as it comes if it happens to require me being transformed into a rather grotesque or abstract or obscure creation then so be it
8297398 now it becomes how much pleasure am i going to take playing masked characters he says
8297399 and when it is a character like hellboy i am sure there are a whole lot of other guys who wish they were me
8297400 it is a real honour to play this character because the heart of this character is truly mythic
8297401 im in favour of the monsters no doubt about that del toro says with a hearty chuckle
8297402 when i was shooting mimic when we were still shooting the screenplay i wrote which changed rapidly one day said
8297403 i think that we humans are the most beautiful and most terrible plague
8297404 i am really really concerned about male adult behavior that many of the worlds affairs are run like playground fights
8297405 it worries me that the level of maturity on international issues continues to be degraded into playground brawls but im not saying
8297406 both are about the most mundane human endeavors getting in the way of the most sublime creatures of imagination and belief he says
8297407 its essentially the same pulse that goes through pans labyrinth which is the girl lives in a world where the fantasies of politics that her stepfather has and the country has are believed to be real while her faith in the other world is seen as a childish concern
8297408 so those things thematically correspond there is a curious melancholy on hellboy ii that i think that people are not addressing as much as the humour but i think the movie has a couple of really melancholy moments
8297409 as the movie pans labyrinth opened and it became successful they the studio felt more confident he says
8297410 you can start second guessing yourself how do i go back for another statue how do i please the people
8297411 i love to listen but im very careful not to fall into polling he says
8297412 im a believer that the last instinct on the set and on the writing has to come from me so i do not take dictation but i do keep an eye and an ear towards the fan community undoubtedly within the hardcore
8297413 i hear for example what they didnt like about the first movie and in some cases when they were right and i just thought they hit the nail right on the head i really screwed over here i screwed over there and i tried to rectify it on the second one
8297414 one of the complaints they had which was legitimate on the first movie they said not enough creatures
8297415 lets never make that mistake again so on this film it became the noahs ark of monsters
8297416 if somebody built a great building and they told me go insane and create the most beautiful three storey penthouse at the top of this building and id go absolutely ill do it because i believe that the craftsmanship the beauty that can be brought to that universe makes the movies able to stand on their own but be part of that symphonic work
8297417 my father was irresponsible enough to buy us a motorbike when i was seven and one thing he said is if youre ever afraid dont get on the bike
8297418 its the same with filmmaking if youre ever afraid dont go in there
8297419 be daunted always daunted and be always prepared but never be afraid so im not afraid im really eager
8297420 be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind dont matter and those who matter dont mind
8297421 ive learned that people will forget what you said people will forget what you did but people will never forget how you made them feel
8297422 i believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge myth is more potent than history dreams are more powerful than facts hope always triumphs over experience laughter is the cure for grief love is stronger than death
8297423 you know youre in love when you cant fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams

8297425 a friend is someone who will bail you out of jail but your best friend is the one sitting next to you saying that was f ing awesome
8297426 the scale of this tour is enormous but the space is really liberating for me thats what we wanted to do give me some more freedom its hard to explain but im in a different mindset parts of the show are so over the top like those freddie moments in
8297427 i dont even know if a lot of people in the audience even know that song i have to assume a lot of people come without having heard the rest of the album
8297428 in retrospect we could definitely have bettered it ill say that straight up minogue admits given the time we had it is what it is i had a lot of fun doing it im excited about bringing those songs to life on stage
8297429 ive stayed a safe enough distance from that minogue says of the cyber debate
8297430 the internet and forums in particular well its not like youre face to face with people in a room and everyone raises their hands and says something so i take a lot of that with a grain of salt
8297431 people want to say something and contradict each other to start conversations thats good but i have to stick to what im doing
8297432 i certainly dont do everything on this tour the way i might have imagined it but thats creativity and i love it for all of its ups and downs
8297433 those two songs are not even recorded minogue says hinting that their personal lyrics didnt sit with the hedonism and heartbreak on
8297434 theyre personal moments in the live show that werent on the album but perhaps that wasnt meant to be this is where theyve found their moment to be expressed
8297435 grim and that the tour has been a work in progress with a clunky beginning its no accident it wasnt filmed for dvd until the london leg
8297436 the setlist of the show now is pretty much as it was meant to be a b c d e f g didnt work so we had to change whole sections it didnt flow the way it was meant to amidst all that i was staying pretty calm at least one on hand
8297437 i can honestly say weve changed something every night whether its hair or make up or putting a song in thats what i mean about freedom in this tour it keeps everyone fresh and on their toes
8297438 oldest person on the stage but her hungry young band certainly breathe life into
8297439 all the changes have been fantastic really refreshing with that group i feel like we could go off piste and do a gig anywhere theyre all so enthusiastic
8297440 no it wasnt to be honest not at all i didnt know what the show was going to be the last thing i wanted was to book an australian tour a year out
8297441 i couldnt actually say last september ill do a tour all year long minogue says
8297442 i had to do it in increments thats really worked its been broken up into phases well have our break and then everyone will be excited to see each other again its a really good vibe relaxed but really on it
8297443 i was sincere in saying to everyone i cant believe weve come this far its been amazing and challenging and with a really difficult start it was all about getting to london and here we are
8297444 theres parts in the show where its emotional but thats the point of doing a show all those different forms of emotion
8297445 it might be it might not be and took another shot at the us market
8297446 i always go over there with the same attitude ive always had which is if its to happen itll happen minogue explains
8297447 im kept pretty much busy enough well see im not racing over there im heading home
8297448 i think it deserved to make a big splash minogue says of the way the media seized on her misdiagnosis revelation
8297449 thats not who i am i dont like doing stuff like that but thats a fact of life that happens and it happens frequently one cant point the finger of blame in any particular direction but i feel better for having shared that
8297450 its a tricky one its not to scare people and i know its a cliche but if one person thinks i might see someone else i just dont feel right then good
8297451 we did it for sex and the city too minogue admits sheepishly
8297452 that was a very cosmopolitan afternoon when theres a day off we organise something thats do able for everyone that was the first time id been to the movies in ages
8297453 tickets to the show for tickets to the cinema minogue says
8297454 a fear psychosis is being created to slow down certain projects of national importance this will be counter productive for the countrys economic growth its global image as well as our ability to attract investments from across the world
8297455 threat by iranian influence to global security the middle east and persian gulf regions
8297456 t he u s military has said the quds force arms equips and finances shiite muslim militiamen who it says are responsible for the death of hundreds of american soldiers
8297457 left tens of thousands of kurds dead but talabani himself a kurd has said in the past that al samarraie sic was not involved
8297458 al samarraie sic did not explain in tuesdays interview why he was abroad but he claimed to have survived several assassination attempts that he said were plotted by iran he gave no details
8297459 most likely would be from other countries egyptians or jordanians or yemenis
8297460 it wouldnt be iraqis the iraqis in al qaeda are few
8297461 a coup is impossible before the start of american bombing
8297462 all of them are frightened of saddam hussein but when the bombing starts everything will be different

8297486 i still wanted it to go ahead i am gutted we have to wait
8297487 it could be december before there is an inquest and that is really scary to think about that
8297488 it will just drag it out more and its already hard enough with his anniversary coming up i just want it to go ahead as soon as possible
8297489 unfortunately i was notified that one of the leading barristers in the case had had a stroke our thoughts are with her at this time
8297490 we had to really see whether we were in a position to actually go ahead with the inquest
8297491 it has become apparent that one side of interested persons felt that without a barrister here that was properly briefed it would be impossible to go ahead
8297492 it is with some regret that we are unable to go ahead with the inquest
8297493 there are a lot of us who emotionally would love to do it

8297512 the pfa who represent james milner are disappointed that information regarding james request for a move and the circumstances surrounding it have come to the publics attention and we feel we have no option but to respond
8297513 the facts are that james transfer request was actually handed in on wednesday august 20 at which point it was asked by newcastle united to keep the matter private
8297514 the request was given because the player was looking for an improvement on his contract that reflected his development and his value to the club there is a meeting between the owner and all relevant people at the club today wednesday when we believed james request was to be discussed
8297515 to clarify the situation james did sign a contract 12 months ago however this agreement was reached with the club nearly 12 months previous at the point in which newcastle had agreed to sell james to aston villa on transfer deadline day 2006 before canceling the agreement at the 11th hour

8297615 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8297616 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8297617 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8297618 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8297619 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away

8297625 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8297626 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8297627 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8297628 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8297629 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8297630 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8297631 we know the parameters of the contract and the giants would have been generous
8297632 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8297633 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8297634 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8297635 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8297636 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8297637 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8297638 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play

8297676 as suppliers continue to work towards overcoming supply and demand constraints changing market dynamics are forcing suppliers to change strategies to move towards offering more end to end services or hold their leadership positions
8297677 because few suppliers today have end to end s2p source to pay service capabilities they are making concerted efforts to round out their capabilities through acquisitions partnerships and internal enhancements
8297678 po suppliers are expanding their delivery footprint across onshore in region and offshore delivery locations
8297679 while sourcing focused suppliers are onshore centric and p2p focused suppliers tend to focus on offshore centric models end to end suppliers have developed a healthy mix of onshore in region and offshore ftes almost all po suppliers are beginning to optimize their location strategies as global sourcing starts to play an increasingly important role in the po market

8297697 it is time to face the music it is we who have been buried
8297698 what happened was not something so big as to change the situation that exists after the last general election
8297699 so that abdullah will realize that his leadership is no longer wanted

8297701 the walls are crumbling but the top guy seems oblivious to his surroundings
8297702 persistently low fertility and an increasing number of survivors to higher ages
8297703 projections such as these are proof that we are right to be carrying out the biggest shake up to the immigration system for a generation
8297704 centre stage is our new australian style points based system which means only those we need can come here to work or study
8297705 essential we develop a coherent strategy to deal with population growth
8297706 this strategy must bring together policy on issues from the family to border control housing to skills and planning to immigration control
8297707 we not only need to ensure that our population grows at a more sustainable rate but that we also prepare properly for that sustainable rate of growth
8297708 the government have shown that they have no answers to the challenges we face by failing to plan for our increasing population this makes them part of the problem not the solution
8297709 population statistics are predicted by using recent figures so this report will have used the statistics of immigration in the uk in the last few years the level is high so the prediction will be high
8297710 there are signs that immigration in this country is starting to tail off if you were to do this again in 2010 or 2011 i think it would be different
8297711 i think its a bit unfair to say its all on the principals head
8297712 thats been demonstrated internationally to be counterproductive and it would be here as well
8297713 obviously we dont want simplistic measures that are just a league table of schools
8297714 what they wanted was a system to hold public education up to ridicule as part of their ideological agenda to support other sorts of schooling

8297754 continues to either misunderstand or deliberately misrepresent the certification issue as a primary argument for the introduction of the proposed regulations
8297755 clearly stated since at least march of this year that refusal to perform or refer for abortion would have no bearing on issuance or renewal of provider certification
8297756 issued guidelines that could shape board certification requirements and necessitate a doctor to perform abortions to be considered competent
8297757 hhs is using to create the illusion that providers rights are under vicious attack when in reality the regulations are the offense blatantly threatening our reproductive freedoms particularly for uninsured and low income women
8297758 attempting to pass off his new regulation as protecting health care providers who for reasons of conscience dont want to take part in abortion services
8297759 schooled in the fine print the regulation might be described as a love letter to extremists
8297760 leavitt does not claim that these laws are inadequate he does not point to any violations of them he seems to want us to believe that he is merely underscoring longstanding laws
8297761 i f leavitts intent is as broad as his broadly worded regulation to suggest your right to health care all health care will be determined by the sensitivities of nearly every person in a white smock and even perhaps others your doctor may not have a problem giving you that prescription but will the pharmacist fill it and if so will the pro life cashier ring it up women have had to run an obstacle course to get reproductive health care in recent years if we leave it to leavitt the number of obstacles will grow
8297762 limits the scope of allowable moral objections to training performing counseling or referring for abortion and sterilization
8297763 to just about anyone who might come into contact with a patient and even some who might not

8297765 going back to 1999 john mccain did an interview with the san francisco chronicle saying that overturning roe v wade would not make any sense because then women would have to have illegal abortions
8297766 told women in columbus ohio that mccain has never signed on to efforts to overturn roe vs
8297767 g iven his radical support for abortion the news that
8297768 not much of a surprise what is a surprise is that some actually consider biden to be moderate on issues related to the dignity of human

8297776 tendente a facilitar al partido socialista su proceso de renovaci n sin tener ning n tipo de interferencia en el mismo
8297777 lo que hemos sabido de boca del portavoz del grupo parlamentario socialista es que no le importa que ese debate se celebre antes del congreso
8297778 cre amos que era importante que la oposici n asistiera en bloque a ese debate pens bamos que al partido socialista le gustar a acudir al debate renovado con su nuevo secretario general en bloque con las ideas claras y un liderazgo definido
8297779 por lo que sabemos del grupo parlamentario socialista o en este caso de su portavoz es que le interesa m s en este momento salir l a la tribuna y repetir ese discurso que tan bien sabe hacer de palmas palmitas a la espalda del presidente del gobierno que presentar un proyecto unido de partido socialista en el propio debate
8297780 ese servilismo que estos momentos caracteriza la actividad del grupo parlamentario socialista y del partido socialista con los intereses de zapatero desde luego no va a hacer que el grupo parlamentario popular haga lo mismo
8297781 sabemos que lo podemos hacer tambi n antes y por lo tanto no es una cuesti n de que retiremos o no retiremos mantengamos o no mantengamos

8297973 the danger is letting the russians think they can get away with this and do it again in ukraine or someplace else they have to realize that theyre not going to get a free ride
8297974 its physically impossible for us to do enough to deter the russians from further incursions so its not clear to me that military aid would be appreciably more than symbolic
8297975 its hard to imagine that the united states would embark on the process of rearming georgia until the conflict has reached a stable equilibrium that at least has the possibility of triggering some kind of military confrontation between the u s and russia

8297995 we are reducing our rating to neutral as we are incrementally more cautious on the commercial performance of byetta following the latest update
8297996 we cannot conclude whether pancreatitis is any more an issue with byetta than other diabetes drugs however we think meaningful gains in the stock will require proof amylin lilly can jump start its growth in the second half 2008 against these latest headwinds and no negative new news from the ongoing healthcare database analysis
8297997 we are downgrading shares of amylin to sell from hold following last nights disclosure of four additional cases of mortality associated with pancreatitis in patients who were on byetta as we believe that a heightened vigilance for patient safety among primary care physicians will blunt the rate of glp 1 adoption driving byetta lars npv lower

8298174 how long until they start thinking about weaponizing insects as well
8298175 that such creatures could be weaponized and the possibility according to one scientist intimately familiar with the project that these cyborg insects might be armed with bio weapons

8298186 plan that reduces to an absolute minimum if not eliminates noncombatant casualties
8298187 help researchers in various disciplines self assemble into teams capable of developing plant inspired actuation systems that will ultimately have application in military adaptive or morphing structures
8298188 darpa supported researchers are studying how geckos climb walls and how an octopus hides to find new approaches to locomotion and highly adaptive camouflage the idea is to let nature be a guide toward better engineering

8298191 investigating ways to prevent fatigue and enable soldiers to stay awake alert and effective for up to seven days straight without suffering any deleterious mental or physical effects and without using any of the current generation of stimulants
8298192 the long term defense implications of finding ways to turn thoughts into acts if it can be developed are enormous imagine u s warfighters that only need use the power of their thoughts to do things at great distances
8298193 inspiration from nature will allow more life like qualities in the system
8298194 were interested in investigating biological organisms because they have evolved over many many years to be particularly good at surviving in the environment and we hope to learn from some of those strategies that mother nature has developed

8298227 we were very lucky that the pilots skill allowed him to land the aircraft where he did
8298228 had he crashed across the road he would have gone straight into the primary school
8298229 he managed to land the aircraft in such a way as to protect the public
8298230 i saw the plane go right into the garage thank god i had ryan with me outside
8298231 it was very scary i was in such a panic and in such shock
8298232 this is not a safe environment for people living here
8298233 it chilled my blood when i heard about it and when they mentioned the school i thought oh golly whats the final report going to be
8298234 he was forced to do a spiral dive he would have been doing circuits which means you are not more than 1000 feet high and couldnt have had time to do it safely
8298235 local residents shouldnt be concerned about these sort of things happening frequently they dont
8298236 this is a terrible tragedy and my thoughts are with the family of the pilot
8298237 at the last meeting we were told there had been 380 000 movements of aircraft in the past 12 months
8298238 thats a lot of aircraft flying around in a very small circle over what is a growing and developing community
8298239 and if they dont do that then they must lower the amount of traffic in the skies
8298240 a very high percentage of the aircraft are 30 years or older and a lot of the activity is training activity involving learners

8298243 one of the most poor and disenfranchised people in this country
8298244 i havent heard from them but when this issue came up at the last alp national conference i said to kevin rudd what you have got to understand about this decision about mining uranium mining is a decision for the states if the people in south australia are happy thats their decision
8298245 i was of the view that it was enough for me to say that as long as i am premier there will be no uranium mining in wa but i listened to what other people had to say and i was convinced by them that it should go beyond just the whim of the premier of the day
8298246 we strongly believe that uranium mining could be an opportunity for our people to generate equity and commercial benefit and importantly play an important part in the development of significant resources projects for this state
8298247 this is an important inter generational issue for our people and its an issue that martu should be able to consider and make decisions about in an informed manner especially as a means of achieving economic and social outcomes for a group of people who continue to be under serviced by state government
8298248 by proposing to ban uranium mining the premier and state alp government are effectively robbing one of the most poor and disenfranchised people in this country of the right to earn a living and potentially achieve an equity stake in a major mining project
8298249 we are about to give them christmas gifts and then spend hundreds of millions buying them back
8298250 she managed to get herself on to the biggest water licence ever to be issued in australia
8298251 but over the four years were hoping the case load is going to diminish the norms within the community will be rebuilt
8298252 thats why i was very keen to set a time limit on the intervention in cape york
8298253 because if we dont rebuild the norms then our program has been badly conceived
8298254 were now dealing with a situation where these norms have fallen into disarray
8298255 we are consciously rebuilding i expect in four years time there will be no need for an elaborate mechanism
8298256 but there will be no more funding of irresponsible behaviour
8298257 i think we wasted many years under the former premier
8298258 there was a commitment but there was not the diligent application in the four terms of the beattie government
8298259 it underlined to me how easy it is that indigenous affairs and the prospects of the most miserable can so easily be put off the agenda
8298260 youve got to wait three years until youve got another chance again
8298261 lo que est en juego en este conflicto es absolutamente esencial

8298265 tough action is necessary and the tough action our reform demands will be rewarded
8298266 the government is committed to investing substantially in our schools to deliver better outcomes but were not making investments without demanding accountability in return
8298267 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time
8298268 kids going to average schools deserve any opportunity that kids at flash schools have and this is the way there
8298269 weve seen what league tables can do in the uk weve seen cases of parents fighting with each other buying addresses raffle tickets so you can get in the line to get into a school thats higher up the league table
8298270 its often based on incorrect information and theres much more to a school than the academic results for a start
8298271 the coalition welcomes the fact that mr rudd is now following our agenda for higher standards and quality in schools but talk is no substitute for action
8298272 mr rudds pressing priority is to lift economic confidence and certainty for australians and australian businesses that are worse off under his government
8298273 the law has long recognised that children remain children until they are 18
8298274 naming and shaming a juvenile will not result in rehabilitation juveniles are entitled to have their identity protected
8298275 what were about is naming offenders and identifying offenders where there is a legitimate public interest in doing so protecting the community
8298276 they are much more in touch with the actual cost of things whereas men dont know whether a loaf of bread is 2 or 4 50
8298277 it started out on a one on one basis and then in small groups of between eight and 12 and then on one occasion there was a large group of at least 60
8298278 there were three former staff members who were listed on the search warrant but only one of them had the word accused next to their name
8298279 the allegations centre around the period of 1970 to the early 1980s so at this stage all the inquiries are at least over 20 years old
8298280 they got a group of between eight and 12 of us together and theyd just start chanting and i would wake up during these sessions and see what was going on
8298281 id imagine it would be very hard for anyone thats subject to these sort of things to come forward
8298282 nsw police force will be providing every form of support we possibly can to make the process for them as trouble free as possible

8298293 she never really answered the key question is he prepared to be president which is the issue she put out there rather dramatically during the primaries
8298294 why isnt she the vice presidential candidate why isnt she the presidential candidate
8298295 i couldnt understand why he would organize a convention to give the clintons two nights and then diss hillary as vice president

8298299 report of the assessment committee for the national space weather program an interagency initiative to speed improvement of space weather services
8298300 if anybody thought that these cubesats would not do things this set of proposals just proved everybody so wrong
8298301 there are a lot of questions in space weather research that are still being struggled with even though weve been flying satellites for many years now
8298302 we dont have a big nasa type budget to do this thats why we are starting our program with cubesat student missions are by nature low cost i thought it was worth a shot
8298303 they want to do space weather and i believe the only way to get some space missions with shrinking budgets is to go this low cost way
8298304 we hope to start a pipeline of missions depending on how the budget turns out for 2009 we will start fast or slow but we are committed to start a pipeline
8298305 very much like the sky at a fourth of july celebration but were seeing it on a cosmic scale
8298306 and were going to see deeper into our universe than ever before
8298307 none of us could have asked for such a smooth turn on it went like clockwork
8298308 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8298309 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8298310 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8298311 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8298312 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8298313 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8298314 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8298315 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8298316 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8298317 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8298318 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8298319 we made several improvements in the technique that could allow us to perform this type of procedure routinely
8298320 the robotic instruments are like having my hands inside the body
8298321 he was brilliant but the thing im trying to tell matty and drum into him and the young players is thats great to be on top of a wave but youve got to try to get to that level where youre cool youre calm and youre responsible and you deliver day in and day out
8298322 matty is in a really good place at the moment when he was left out he didnt open his mouth or anything he just went back to the drawing board at sussex and has done a fantastic job there
8298323 hes turned up back here with us as a different bloke and hes been brilliant fair play to the guy because he could have gone away and felt sorry for himself but hes gone away and scored hundred after hundred for sussex
8298324 i was pleased he finished not out with six catches its brilliant because it has been a headache for however long with our wicketkeeper but lets hope it stays good because hes a hell of a batsman
8298325 we came off such a high in the test series some of the best moments in my career and this is right down there in terms of the lowest
8298326 we have to regroup pretty quickly take this blow on the chin come back from it and play our kind of cricket your confidence can take a big dent when you lose like this
8298327 its reaching the point right now for me i probably shouldnt have played in this game where we look to the medical team and see if we can come up with something
8298328 worshiping god as if you see him because if you dont he sees you
8298329 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8298330 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8298331 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8298332 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8298333 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8298334 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8298335 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8298336 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8298337 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8298338 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8298339 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8298340 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8298341 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8298342 we continue to have the focus and discipline in place to drive substantial improvement even in the midst of a very challenging consumer environment
8298343 obviously we are not satisfied with posting a loss but we clearly have this going in the right direction and are making significant progress towards our profit goals
8298344 has yet to prove it can stabilize these metrics and the top line let alone grow
8298345 with constant and really mounting pressure from online delivery online e books and retail discounters borders clearly has a tough environment in which to turn around
8298346 enrico fermi was the first person to suggest how cosmic particles could be accelerated to high speeds
8298347 his theory provides the foundation for understanding the new phenomena his namesake telescope will discover
8298348 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8298349 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8298350 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8298351 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8298352 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8298353 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8298354 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8298355 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8298356 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8298357 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8298358 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8298359 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8298360 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8298361 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8298362 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8298363 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8298364 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8298365 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8298366 who are open to doing something on the production side
8298367 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8298368 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8298369 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8298370 comecei na base do vasco da gama depois fui para ceil ndia e iraty tamb m tive uma passagem pelo colonia da alemanha

8298374 we are gratified by the willingness of all parties to work effectively towards a common goal the best interests of the customers of northern
8298375 these settlements provide a fair and appropriate framework and a predictable regulatory roadmap for unitils new gas distribution businesses in maine and new hampshire and we look forward to timely approval closing and transition
8298376 jim siegels extensive knowledge and expertise in the securities industry and his dedication to our firm as exemplified by his strong work ethic has earned him this well deserved promotion
8298377 maxim group is also fortunate to have attracted chris massey who brings considerable legal talent to our firm
8298378 these fast snapshots will let scientists monitor rapidly changing sources
8298379 this is 3c 454 3 in pegasus a type of active galaxy called a blazar its now undergoing a flaring episode that makes it especially bright
8298380 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8298381 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8298382 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8298383 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8298384 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8298385 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8298386 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

8298389 our objective was to establish this as a venue at which auto manufacturers could display and the public learn about and drive the latest green machines
8298390 we successfully demonstrated that these current and future environmentally friendly vehicles are remarkable fun to drive in keeping with the spirit of the woodward dream cruise lean mean and green
8298391 a high 85 3 percent of respondents said they were delighted or very delighted with the power of the green machines they experienced clearly indicating that fun and green can go together
8298392 moreover nearly 87 percent of respondents said they would consider purchasing a green vehicle and of those nearly half 44 8 percent said they would do so within two years
8298393 almost as many 40 2 percent said they werent sure when some indication of the opportunity existing for auto manufacturers to capitalize on this green car interest

8298398 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8298399 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8298400 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8298401 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8298402 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8298403 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8298404 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8298405 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8298406 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8298407 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8298408 scheduling is very difficult two of them happened to be in venice at the same time because of the burn after reading premiere so there was a brainstorming session

8298469 sustained partnerships by governments the private sector and international organizations are needed to provide these children with access to the education and resources to enable them to overcome the poverty and exploitation that has defined their childhood

8298477 better does not necessarily mean more entertaining if you want entertainment you watch twenty20 cricket we dont want rugby to be twenty20 cricket
8298478 that has to be the judgment line these changes have been made with a view to entertainment not to improving rugby
8298479 the pressure on rugby in australia is to win fans theyre competing directly against aussie rules rugby league and football
8298480 all three are simple motion games where the ball is always in play to compete the super 14 has become a quick tap motion game
8298481 the ball is in play a lot but that doesnt create a better game it creates entertainment to the detriment of rugby
8298482 now theres test match cricket and twenty20 cricket but we need to keep test match rugby
8298483 around the world most people want to watch test rugby there are pockets around the world who want to see twenty20 cricket so lets make twenty12 rugby
8298484 we could have 12 players 20 minutes each way with no scrums or line outs
8298485 as the game becomes more professional another form of the game could develop sevens hasnt been a success as entertainment
8298486 it might do well in hong kong and wellington but around the world you might find another form of the game springs up eventually
8298487 just have a look at what the world cup has done in europe rugby in france is so big now they had four club games with 80 000 crowds last season
8298488 rugby in france is going through the roof because the world cup was so successful
8298489 watch bath against wasps in january it was one of the best games ive ever seen there were unbelievable skills levels on show
8298490 it had everything if a game is played well and refereed well then there is nothing wrong with it if you play the game well then it becomes a spectacle
8298491 hes coming on all right and we are hopeful of getting him there obviously he wont get a run before the leger
8298492 it is a very delicate balance in that i dont want to say dont worry hell make it easy peasy but equally i dont want to put everyone completely away at the moment we are hopeful of getting him there
8298493 the st leger is definitely an option for savarain and we will decide nearer the time whether we let him take his chance or not
8298494 he was entered to run over a mile and three quarters in the melrose stakes but unfortunately the ground and the meeting went against him he needs good going to be at his best
8298495 he will have no problem in stepping up in distance but the step up in class could be a problem for him
8298496 theres no time to get a run into him before the st leger and there are no races for him either
8298497 we will decide nearer the time if he is ready to take his place in a group one race
8298498 he would have to run well there but if he goes and wins then we would obviously have to consider running him at doncaster
8298499 he took the step up to a mile and three quarters really well on his last start at haydock and he obviously stays the trip
8298500 he won in heavy ground there and we would prefer cut in the ground for him if he were to take his chance
8298501 if he comes out of chester in good form then we will seriously look at the race for him
8298502 rarely can the st leger have had such an open look to it with the race just over two weeks away
8298503 the front six horses in our betting are separated by just a single point and no horse has really captured the imagination of ante post punters
8298504 probably the best backed horse in the past couple of weeks has been unsung heroine she has been supported since her win in a group three at cork earlier this month and is now 8 1 from 10 1

8298508 first major conflict since 9 11 for the united states
8298509 my own selfishness and immaturity i cannot escape blame by pointing a finger at the stress of war the blame was entirely mine
8298510 i believe that its not an accident that our hostages came home from iran when president reagan was president of the united states
8298511 the renewal of accreditation proves that the commonwealth technical institute at hgac adheres to or exceeds the highest educational standards
8298512 all of the students and staff at the institute share in this honor and i certainly commend them for their hard work on a well deserved achievement
8298513 its obviously a new partnership but weve done well so far
8298514 a bit like anything it develops and you get used to running between the wickets and communicating to the point where it will just be a simple nod rather than a call
8298515 things like that do happen over time and given the time i think fingers crossed it could be a good opening partnership
8298516 i dont think you can have defined roles because there are too many variables
8298517 we know what we want to do and we know where we want to be at the end of the powerplays and during the powerplays but on different wickets that might adjust slightly against different bowlers
8298518 there are times when bowlers are allowed to bowl well and they will have good days so there are times you have to sit in
8298519 there will be days when ian is absolutely on fire and hitting everything for four and there will be days when im clubbing around a little bit and getting ones and twos and vice versa
8298520 i dont think theres a greater emphasis on me taking risks and i personally dont see it that way because ive worked very hard on not risking my wicket
8298521 as a batter youve got to have pride in the fact you want to bat youre playing for england youre representing your country and none of us want to go out there and just throw it away
8298522 you have that pride and its something ive worked very hard on to not just give it away but there are risks you have to take
8298523 ive had experience of opening the batting for sussex and if i need a boundary i know what kind of shot i need to play but its trying to make sure you get the level of risk management right
8298524 you want a boundary but its a question of working out which is your best option and to be fair to ian he stands and plays nice shots and gets boundaries
8298525 stuart broad and james anderson have been with england but ive played against fred and harmy this summer and for them to be coming on first and second change is fantastic
8298526 orthopaedic intervention for stroke patients can help to maximize the chances that the affected arm for example may still be useful for activities of daily life
8298527 it is critical for the orthopaedic surgeon to become involved in the management of these patients immediately following the stroke to ensure the best possible outcome
8298528 during this time patients and families are primarily focused on the cognitive effects of the injury
8298529 but it is important to remember that there are numerous non surgical treatments that should be employed to maximize the functional use of the affected limb
8298530 it becomes crucial to consider surgery to reduce or eliminate painful muscle spasms and correct deformities the type of surgery performed depends on which areas are affected and whether or not the limb has been determined to be functional

8298571 el consejo noratl ntico condena la decisi n de la federaci n rusa de extender el reconocimiento a las regiones georgianas de osetia del sur y abjazia y pide a rusia que revoque su decisi n
8298572 argumentamos constantemente que ser a imposible despu s de esto decirle a los abjasos y osetas y decenas de otros grupos en todo el mundo que lo que era bueno para los albano kosovares no era bueno para ellos en las relaciones internacionales no se puede tener una regla para unos y otra para otros

8298581 being a u s based tour and with the majority of our fan base pro am contestants sponsors and participants being english speaking we think it is important for our players to effectively communicate in english
8298582 we play so good overall when you win you should give your speech in english
8298583 mostly what comes out is nerves totally different language in front of the camera youre excited and not thinking in english

8298586 but we have reached out to others who are not korean and other international players and impressed upon them the need to speak english and the requirements of this policy players have been very supportive of it
8298587 from what i can see golfers from other countries will not be required to speak only english while engaged in lpga activities rather they will be required to pass an english proficiency test if the lpga can show that english proficiency is a relevant qualification to competing in a professional golf tournament in the u s they would have a defense to any claim that they are discriminating unlawfully

8298602 in addition the exit of white persons who had a contribution to make from the civil service followed an unfortunate course that resulted in a skills vacuum in some areas of the public service
8298603 it is something that we aim to correct over time to ensure that those experts who can add substantial value to public service delivery will be given a chance to return and make the contribution they were trained to do
8298604 it is not only in the public service where white and black south africans have worked side by side to make south africa a better place to live

8298607 underwriting performance of the personal and commercial business as well as the specialist classes met or exceeded expectations in the first six months despite several catastrophic flooding events in kwazulu natal
8298608 although this unit recorded a loss for the six months compared to a profit in the corresponding period the diversification of santam across business lines as well as the current reinsurance programme kept the overall underwriting margin healthy
8298609 of particular concern is the increased inflationary environment reduction in disposable income of individuals and deteriorating public infrastructure in some areas having the benefit of diversification santam is well positioned to face these challenges
8298610 in light of the volatility of global and local financial markets the capital growth of our investment portfolio during 2008 could be under further pressure taking cognisance of our capital levels we need to maintain appropriate exposure to the various asset classes in line with general consensus we expect interest rates to remain at current levels for the foreseeable future which will have a positive impact on our cash related investment returns

8298642 we have been under dogs all during the summer and now we are champions we made hard work of it conditions were terrible bad we played against a fierce strong wind and we just had to work terrible hard
8298643 we knew at half time if we stayed at it we had a good chance of winning it we have never given up every game we have played we have worked to the very end
8298644 these lads are a fantastic bunch of lads they have worked so hard since last march at the moment they are missing nobody all the talk in the county they were missing seven or eight lads no disrespect to them but these lads won this themselves
8298645 we missed a goal and a few points early on we started well and our achilles heel was not taking our chances the momentum went away from us and they looked as if they wanted it more we had no control at midfield and we couldnt turn ball
8298646 i spoke to you after the match last week and i hadnt been impressed with our performance then
8298647 tonight you would have had to be impressed and even though we had missed chances in the first half then as long as we stuck to our game plan the chances would come i suppose patrick being an inter county player always has the potential to deliver and he did so again tonight
8298648 the two nolans are probably the two of the most consistent and hard est workers in training and they work very hard both on and off the ball they are also good footballers and are very brave as well
8298649 that was not the result we were expecting tonight we were very flat and didnt respond on the night training has been going well it didnt happen for us we have to regroup now it is back to training on tuesday night and it puts the ball back in fenaghs court we have three matches left and we will just have to take it from here
8298650 after the poor start we were lucky to be in with a shout at half time and i thought we could do it when we were that close we thought we could take them early in the second half but a lack of fitness let us down and a lot of missed passes didnt help in fairness though the better team won on the day
8298651 g this time he concentrated on the positives but was well aware that his side would need to improve even further if they are to have any say in the business end of the championship
8298652 it wasnt a bad performance but i wasnt as happy with the second half performance we will have to improve a 100 on the second half we got eleven points from play which was good we probably missed as much
8298653 andrew and james played great football willie did a lot of covering in the second half i didnt see the indiscipline i have discipline driven into them and they have got this far in the hurling because of their good record i will have a word with them afterwards
8298654 i would see it as being a defining game it was considered to be a defining game you test your metal against sides like rathvilly and we came up so short it was unreal its not an awful lot to do with football
8298655 thats taking nothing away from rathvilly and their football because they were outstanding tonight as well as their football they had a hunger and a togetherness we just couldnt match
8298656 g was backboned by hunger but now should fenagh win on saturday they could be out of the group
8298657 i dont know i would hope that anybody would be happy with just one championship
8298658 i cant get into the mindsets of them i suppose because it was the first one in so many years might have had an influence i dont know but look as far as im concerned thats for the record books thats well and truly gone that display out there just wasnt good enough for the pal jersey
8298659 pal are always there or there abouts in the championship and theres always been a bit of niggle between the two clubs so it was great to get the win today
8298660 i know its only another step for us in the championship and weve kildavin clonegal next week so weve plenty of things to worry about
8298661 the backs are playing really well theyre hassling everybody our trainer john divilly is drilling that into them theyre moving the ball out quickly as well so were happy with them
8298662 it wasnt going great at the start of the season there were a few problems but hopefully were coming together now
8298663 they hit us with a couple of big ships and we just werent up to the mark thats the bottom line why that was well maybe well have to take a good long look at ourselves the management players everybody
8298664 i dont know if it is one particular thing or a series of them it just isnt right at the moment
8298665 we had worked a lot on midfield at training and it paid off today they were a big step up from the last day
8298666 the plan now is to get the team going and confident overall though we were happy with the forwards but there were a few mistakes made and well be working on them during the week
8298667 sean doesnt mind where he plays hes ready to come off the bench whenever we need him and hes offering great advice on the line as well when we bring him in he offers an awful lot of experience to the side and you can play him anywhere
8298668 g the team everyone has to worry about thats further down the line though
8298669 same place as you always go when youre beaten back to the training ground thats all you can do theres nowhere else to go

8298739 if those who are the religious elite are closest to god why is it that they are so rarely closest to love if god is love those who know god best would love people most jesus said he came not to condemn the world but to bring the world life why is it that so many who represent him are ever so quick to condemn
8298740 religion exists not because god loves too little but because we need love so much in the end all religions misrepresent god they either dictate requirements for love or simply become a requiem for love i think many of us have given up on god on this basis alone weve been told that god is a reluctant lover and his standards must be met before there can be any talk of love this is lunacy love exists because god is love our souls will never find satisfaction until our hearts have found this love that we so desperately yearn for
8298741 god is not passive for love is never passive but always passionate and passion always leads to action

8298784 the practice principal at redlands veterinary clinic dr david lovell will be provided with a copy of your complaint and asked for a response to the concerns you have raised as to the hygiene standards of the practice as observed byyou
8298785 dr lovell wasnt present at the discussions about the complaints and wont be in any future discussions

8298787 we would probably carry out 3500 different procedures or interactions with horses each year and id be surprised if we had 20 or 30 problems and infections so i think the success rate we have is remarkable

8298789 were not just going to be pushed under the carpet

8298791 theres nothing to say he was even there on the days of the problems the complainants say they witnessed
8298792 quite honestly we couldnt cope with the leeds front lads once the second goal went in it was disappointing to say the least
8298793 if you defend like that youre going to get beat against any level of opposition and i thought the two centre forwards bullied our defenders from start to finish
8298794 im not used to coming to leeds and losing i usually enjoy coming here and putting one over on them but they thoroughly deserved it
8298795 im asking people to step up to the plate and when they get their chance to go and take it ive got to say that from one to 11 tonight they all performed
8298796 it shows that we have a very strong squad of players here and competition brings out the quality in people

8298801 i look up to him when i am playing not just for cricket but to show that if you persevere anything can happen
8298802 it is great to be celebrating his birthday to go to the same school and to have played cricket on this oval so many times
8298803 i love cricket it is amazing to be living in the same place the don lived
8298804 i have always dreamed of being a great cricketer and following in the dons footsteps
8298805 it is awesome to think we go to the same school
8298806 he bradman was chairman of selectors when i was captain in the 1950s
8298807 we would have many discussions about various players he was a person who very much knew his own mind he did not suffer fools gladly
8298808 he trotted down the pitch as i followed through to the side and by a strange coincidence our eyes met
8298809 talking about the olympics i think hes mark spitz and michael phelps and more
8298810 as far as im concerned hes the greatest sportsman ive ever seen
8298811 this is exactly the sort of thing my dad would have loved to have heard
8298812 it would have resonated with him he would have been surprised and touched by this if he was alive today
8298813 i coached against them when i was with south korea and ive watched four or five dvds lately and they play a typical russian style of football
8298814 they are strong tough and very well organised it is going to be a hectic evening against them
8298815 i dont think we have had too many problems playing against asian countries but i think that uzbekistans style will probably suit our team better
8298816 definitely the players are more used to playing against european type football
8298817 they are comfortable with the heat they will be well prepared
8298818 i met him in istanbul i saw him train and play and he looks good
8298819 i think turkish football suits him well galatasaray love to play attacking football and that is good for harry
8298820 i am worried about mark not having a club its not an ideal situation
8298821 he is young and talented and played well in china
8298822 it is important to have him with us for the training camps and it is a good chance for him to show that he is a national team player
8298823 he probably wont play in the friendly but he has two weeks to get over his problem

8298883 shes in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and her focus remains on the studio
8298884 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8298885 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8298886 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8298887 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8298888 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8298889 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8298890 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8298891 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8298892 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8298893 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8298894 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8298895 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8298896 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8298897 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8298898 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8298899 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8298900 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8298901 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8298902 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8298903 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8298904 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8298905 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8298906 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8298907 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8298908 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8298909 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8298910 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8298911 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8298912 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8298913 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8298914 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8298915 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8298916 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8298917 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8298918 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8298919 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8298920 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8298921 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8298922 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8298923 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8298924 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8298925 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8298926 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8298927 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8298928 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8298929 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8298930 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8298931 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8298932 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8298933 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8298934 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8298935 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8298936 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8298937 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8298938 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8298939 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8298940 no one works for someone we all just work together
8298941 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8298942 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8298943 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8298944 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children

8298947 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8298948 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8298949 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8298950 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8298951 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8298952 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8298953 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8298954 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8298955 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8298956 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8298957 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8298958 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8298959 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8298960 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8298961 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8298962 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8298963 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8298964 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8298965 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8298966 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8298967 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8298968 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8298969 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8298970 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8298971 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8298972 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8298973 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8298974 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8298975 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8298976 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8298977 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8298978 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8298979 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8298980 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8298981 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8298982 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8298983 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8298984 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8298985 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8298986 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8298987 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8298988 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8298989 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8298990 they have a story line but i want us to all shout loud and clear so the press can hear it we are united behind obama
8298991 its unacceptable that in every major issue of our time we are going backwards not forwards
8298992 theyre not relying on his celebrity factor or the coolness of obama they have invested real resources into getting out the youth vote
8298993 thats your representative you folks must really be proud of her

8299085 by adopting uhf gen2 into our system we are able to bring the market an operational platform that is universally accepted and can be integrated with current or future rfid systems
8299086 the rfid technology interest that is hottest for us right now is for asset management
8299087 this yard management solution is an extension of that people are starting to realize there is a strong roi for tracking their trailers and managing other assets with rfid

8299092 hes had a rocky relationship with the partys conservative base
8299093 the republican party is the next guy in line party whoever he picks as vice president could become the next guy in line if he picks a mainstream conservative then the conservatives can get excited not just about the mccain candidacy but the future of the party
8299094 a week ago romney and pawlenty looked like the two most likely conservative choices but i think over the last several days events have conspired against both of them
8299095 ive got nothing for you on the vp question he will select a fine running mate i dont know who that will be
8299096 i think his aides floated the idea of lieberman to prove to mccain that it would get knocked down
8299097 selecting a whitman or fiorina may have made more sense when he was 12 points behind
8299098 if hes even in the polls he may be less likely to take a risk but then john mccain does like to take risks

8299104 quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country
8299105 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business but its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going some place else in a much more expeditionary environment where the marine air ground task force really seems to have a true and enduring value then thats where we need to be
8299106 in england people dont have time to feel the joy of life throughout the week they work so hard they only talk to people at lunch
8299107 then in the evening they watch tv so they can get up early for work the next day the main attraction is a timetable at the railway station where trains leave for less rainy cities
8299108 id like to clarify that i did not make these particular remarks i spoke about the difficulty i had settling in to life in manchester but that does not reflect how i feel now
8299109 does not use the phrase war on terrorism more remarkably he doesnt mention islam much less islamic extremism which mr bush has described as a critical ideological threat to freedom inside and outside the muslim world
8299110 terrorism is a means not an end and very different groups and countries are using it toward very different goals if we cant even identify the enemy or describe the war were fighting its difficult to see how we will win
8299111 the war in chechnya is a war of liberation it engaged in terrorist activities but it is fundamentally different
8299112 there has been a shift in islam that i believe is connected to the failures of governments and the failures of the west to work with many of these countries in order to make sure that opportunities are there that theres bottom up economic growth
8299113 failures of the west to work with many of these countries
8299114 but what we also want to do is to shrink the pool of potential recruits and that involves engaging the islamic world rather than vilifying it and making sure that we understand that not only are those in islam who would resort to violence a tiny fraction of the islamic world but that also the islamic world itself is diverse
8299115 the security forces are making claims to create panic among the people
8299116 this is a show cause notice and we have sought comments from the secretary of the health ministry and the aiims director on a complaint filed with the nhrc
8299117 we are seeking the nhrcs intervention because we have no faith in any internal inquiry by the institute
8299118 we want to clarify that none of the deaths was due to the medication or interventions used in clinical trials
8299119 clinical research is the mandate of the aiims clinicians novel therapies are examined keeping in mind the utmost safety for all patients
8299120 the research protocol undergoes intense scrutiny by the internationally recognised institute ethics committee written informed consent is taken from parents and guardians
8299121 most of the 42 clinical trials have reported no deaths the deaths are mainly due to inherent diseases and not due to medicines used

8299152 of all the letters we receive most people say something about how alone they feel theres a real need to find at least one other couple with whom they can share their infertility struggle
8299153 the worst thing especially after all the effort that went into us trying to conceive was being around couples who talked about getting pregnant as though it was only a matter of scheduling time for sex
8299154 the emotional upheaval of hoping we were pregnant each month and then having my period was another thing
8299155 women need to come alongside other women and be open honest and supportive regarding infertility issues
8299156 trusting that god may use you to encourage and bless another
8299157 the most supportive thing was receiving cards and notes of encouragement
8299158 sometimes its nice to have friends communicate their love encouragement and prayer support without requiring any questions to be answered or any explanations given
8299159 i wish someone would have told me early on that adoption is as great as it is and that god has other ways to give us children and can bless that
8299160 for a season say no it doesnt mean its forever
8299161 couples should not feel guilty and others should not make them feel guilty about not accepting invitations to baby showers and other similar events

8299174 when we emerge at the end of october hopefully with our fully accredited degrees from the harvard business school we are hoping we will be better prepared to launch reinvents global initiative which has been in the works now for the last 6 months
8299175 we feel that pulling back the bow for these 60 days will allow our reinvent arrows to fly high when released and will firmly hit the target upon our graduation which is scheduled for

8299178 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8299179 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8299180 the catholic church at the moment feels very strongly that it begins at the point of conception
8299181 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy

8299203 if you treat your comics as newspapers from a fictional universe theres no reason to read them twice marvel and dc have essentially told their readers that any given issue is not only important as long as it connects to this network of events or because it contains a certain plot point theyre creating stories that can be replaced by reading a spoiler on a blog and when you create that type of story you have to follow that logic to its natural end and relish the ephemerality make the best piece of disposable entertainment you can make it look like the other kinds of disposable entertainment that we understand

8299215 a concert of this nature is not conducive to teach the younger generation to become good citizens upright and competitive but instead would weaken them morally and mentally if the concert organisers do not heed this warning to cancel the concert pas youth will order all muslim youth to turn up and protest the concert in order to prevent it from taking place
8299216 it seems to be a very technical speech about being a democrat supporting obama as a democrat but she never answered the big question on whether he was ready
8299217 there is still work to do on the bill clinton front
8299218 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver
8299219 we are in pursuit of a common state based on the political equality of the two peoples and the equal status of the two
8299220 spokesman ercakica also added that this is the purpose of the negotiations which will commence on 3 september 2008 and the recent developments in the region are the indications of the urgency to reach the said aim
8299221 we are already in favor of a structure which shall not prejudice the turkish cypriots right of self determination and in which the turkish cypriot people shall be able to exercise their right of self determination under the umbrella of a new state of cyprus that will be established logically what the turkish cypriot side can achieve alone regarding this issue is limited the greek cypriot side should also employ the same point of view and create opportunities to that end
8299222 the ossetians and abkhazians could not have been forced to live together with those who have attacked them
8299223 after this point the russian authorities need to revise their cases and their knowledge concerning the cyprus problem since 1950s the turkish cypriot people have been forced to establish their own separate administration as a result of the greek cypriot attacks the turkish cypriots have been striving to ensure their own safety maintain their economic existence and improve their social solidarity since 1963 in order to survive under their own separate administration given that the ossetians and the abkhazians can not be forced to live together with those who have attacked them the turkish cypriot people also have the right to self determination in return for the greek cypriot attacks in this context the russian authorities should be ready to change their views concerning the cyprus problem as well as their position to act like a greek cypriot militant regarding the cyprus problem

8299227 i have someone i care about but that feeling i can never allow to be known
8299228 the company has decided that for this next critical stage of the age we would have fresh editorial and executive leadership
8299229 i wish to report that andrew jaspan will no longer be editor in chief
8299230 i will come and bid my adieu on the floor at 12noon
8299231 there will be reviews of operating production and support processes in all areas including editorial to ensure optimal employment of staff and technology and including outsourcing of elements that will not impact our quality position
8299232 as a result of this program a number of positions will likely be declared redundant
8299233 you would have noticed that the metropolitan mastheads financial position had declined
8299234 he has our thanks and appreciation for all he has achieved in the past four years
8299235 discussing with andrew the ways his skills and expertise can be made available within the company
8299236 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8299237 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8299238 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8299239 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8299240 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8299241 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8299242 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8299243 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8299244 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8299245 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8299246 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8299247 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8299248 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8299249 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8299250 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8299251 a report that shows not just how their child is doing but how their childs school is performing compared to similar schools
8299252 i know some will resist these changes he said today
8299253 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time
8299254 many but by no means all of these schools are in the government school system we should not tolerate underperformance
8299255 this is not about creating an arbitrary public league table it is about ensuring all schools and all teachers and all students are focused on achieving the results we need as a nation and realising the potential of each child he said
8299256 under our new reform partnership beginning from next year we will work towards establishing a similar scheme in australia
8299257 currently most teachers reach a salary ceiling at around 75 000 if they aspire to earn more they must leave the classroom
8299258 we believe we must try to shape the future of our region rather than let it simply be shaped by events and that means unapologetically prosecuting an activist foreign defence and security policy for the future he said
8299259 quality education the case for an education revolution in our schools
8299260 in summary we need to build a culture of high expectations in our schools for students and teachers mr rudd writes in the introduction to the document
8299261 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8299262 quando sono state appiccate le fiamme i bambini non si trovavano nelledificio solo la donna si trovava in una delle due camere incendiate ed rimasta ustionata nel tentativo di scappare
8299263 la suora era in un centro pastorale nel distretto di kandhamal quando stata aggredita e picchiata
8299264 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8299265 avete partecipato a questa campagna solo per me o per lamerica
8299266 altri quatto anni come gli otto che abbiamo gi passato

8299269 quando barack obama sar alla casa bianca rivitalizzer la nostra economia difender i lavoratori affronter le sfide globali della nostra era ha continuato i democratici sanno come fare queste cose se ben ricordo il presidente clinton lo ha gi fatto e il presidente obama lo far di nuovo
8299270 non abbiamo bisogno di altri quattro anni uguali agli ultimi otto ha scandito non abbiamo bisogno che i posti di lavoro continuino a lasciare lamerica che il debito aumenti le famiglie continuino a perdere le case e ci siano pi privilegi per pochi e meno diritti per molti
8299271 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8299272 avremmo sparato a obama da grande distanza circa 750 metri usando un fucile
8299273 barack una persona come tutte le altre ha ripetuto pi volte michelle nelle interviste pre convention viene dalla classe media e riuscito a fare il college solo grazie alle borse di studio i suoi problemi sono quelli di tutti i genitori americani vuole un avvenire migliore per le nostre figlie
8299274 un uomo integro capace di trascinare lamerica e di restituire speranza
8299275 io e barack siamo stati educati con gli stessi valori ha ricordato che devi lavorare sodo per ottenere ci che vuoi nella vita che la parola data un vincolo che se prometti qualcosa lo dovrai mantenere e che devi trattare ogni persona con dignit e rispetto anche se non sei daccordo con loro
8299276 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre
8299277 e grazie alla forza di volont e alla determinazione di uomini cos ha aggiunto alludendo al padre e al marito che questa settimana possiamo celebrare due anniversari gli 88 anni del diritto di voto alle donne e i 45 del discorso di martin luther king che ci ispir con il suo sogno
8299278 una nuova stagione di speranza speranza per molti non solo pi per pochi

8299281 una scelta non facile ma lunica possibilit per salvare le vite delle persone

8299283 si tratta di una evidente annessione di quei territori che sono parte della georgia

8299286 da tempo ludc aveva posto lattenzione sulle aree agricole e sul censimento delle stesse
8299287 e stata necessaria la violenza su i due turisti olandesi per capire che a roma sono centinaia le strutture ex agricole abbandonate e occupate da clandestini e da persone senza fissa dimora
8299288 da anni le organizzazioni agricole chiedono di affrontare questo problema continua ciocchetti unidea dare la possibilit ai proprietari di poter farne un utilizzo produttivo cedendo al comune una parte di queste strutture per utilizzi sociali
8299289 nel programma presentato durante la campagna elettorale per sindaco tutto questo era stato menzionato e affrontato
8299290 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8299291 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8299292 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato
8299293 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8299294 tutto quello che capitato nei giorni passati va nella parte opposta
8299295 tutti ormai in occidente si pongono il problema di mettersi nei panni della russia
8299296 la ragione di stato ci ha reso complici nel dimenticare la cecenia
8299297 oggi la russia torna in una condizione di forza soprattutto per il suo profilo energetico
8299298 partnership interesse anche della russia e che nessuno vuole tornare alla guerra fredda
8299299 costruire una seria e nuova politica di partnership dal punto di vista occidentale con gli usa in primo luogo nella relazione con la russia
8299300 il primo impegno della futura amministrazione americana devessere quello di un lavoro comune
8299301 mettiamoci nei panni russi conclude casini ma anche nei nostri
8299302 well thats cool crimson trace did that for us but i dont really use laser sights

8299305 females are the front line purchasers which makes them more sensitive to the actual cost of things he said
8299306 when theres not enough money it affects their wellbeing very quickly
8299307 theres a false sense of security thats certainly been evident he said
8299308 it gradually dawns on men that theres not enough money for a meal at a restaurant and then it has a knock on effect on their wellbeing
8299309 the economic situation has been so stable during the survey he said
8299310 ecological footprinting is a technique used to track the many flows of nature that support our daily life if your bag of lifes goodies comes from around the wold the footprint adds up your share of the oil rigs roads wheat fields and forests that go into your goodies can nature keep pace with your consumption

8299324 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8299325 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8299326 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8299327 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8299328 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8299329 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

8299335 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8299336 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8299337 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8299338 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8299339 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8299340 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8299341 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8299342 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8299343 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8299344 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8299345 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8299346 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8299347 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8299348 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8299349 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8299350 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8299351 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8299352 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8299353 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8299354 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8299355 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8299356 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8299357 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8299358 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8299359 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8299360 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8299361 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8299362 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8299363 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8299364 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8299365 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8299366 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8299367 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8299368 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8299369 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8299370 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8299371 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8299372 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8299373 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8299374 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8299375 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8299376 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8299377 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8299378 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8299379 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8299380 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8299381 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8299382 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8299383 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8299384 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8299385 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8299386 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8299387 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8299388 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8299389 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8299390 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8299391 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8299392 rational optimism leads to stagnation it is irrational optimism that leads to reform
8299393 yeah but rudolph killed all those people so long ago surely youre not going to hold that against him
8299394 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8299395 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8299396 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8299397 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8299398 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest

8299400 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again

8299457 the chinese have a lot to learn from our athletics training methods and we also have a great deal to learn from their sports success we are already talking and we hope to implement some of the ideas we have soon
8299458 we have received overwhelming support from the government corporate organisations and individuals and it is these actions that have spurred our athletes on to their performances at the olympics
8299459 a work of architecture must give expression to the life for which it was intended it must not only competently satisfy the requirements of the program but its form should resonate with the diverse spaces and activities it contains

8299473 tom cruise should have been more careful it is obvious that being the head of a company you have to delegate some tasks there are employees colleagues or co producers to which you assign things to

8299477 we are talking with the prtc and trying to reach an agreement to make this process more agile
8299478 the board of directors of the tourism development fund tdf and the government development bank gdb approved late last week the direct financing of a 120 million construction loan for the 150 room bah a beach st regis five star hotel in r o grande
8299479 the gdb has the responsibility and the financial capacity to assume its fiscal agent role when the private sector is limited by present economic conditions we will take this role without necessarily competing with the private sector banks the st regis represents an important development in the tourism industry so we must ensure its viability through the tdf as soon as the private banks are in a position to support the project they will do so
8299480 firstbank had preapproved the construction loan but with a gdb full guarantee apparently the gdb decided to provide the financing directly instead of the requested guarantee as a matter of public policy
8299481 i cant deny that the paseo caribe situation has had and is having an impact regarding the perception of financial institutions developers and investors
8299482 antonio mu ozs mu oz holdings and federico s nchezs interlink group are excellent clients with excellent credit we believe in the project and understand the importance it has for puerto rico but we have a fiduciary responsibility to the regulators the credit rating agencies and our shareholders
8299483 beauchamp is not going to let the same dog bite him three times the first time was the marriott courtyard the second paseo caribe and he is not going to let the same dog bite him a third time it would show very poor business judgment and he is a veteran banker with plenty of it the government allowed this situation to happen so now it has to face the consequences this applies not just to firstbank but any other bank willing to finance substantial tourism projects in puerto rico
8299484 in puerto rico there are only three banks left in that segment financing of major tourism projects of the industry firstbank scotiabank and popular
8299485 of course there is an element of discussion among the gdb board of directors but i can only speak as a member of the board of the tourism development fund tdf and the hotel development corp hdc our priority has been and still is to participate in conjunction with private sector banks
8299486 for years tdf and gdb policy has been to not be a direct lender letting private sector banks provide the financing and that continues to be the priority but if private sector banks cant or dont want to assume the risk and demand certain conditions that for them are not negotiable then we have to rethink our function and assume a more active role in the financing of essential tourism development projects such as the five star st regis mandarin and regent
8299487 these projects are so important that even before the discussions with the gdb the hdc had approved investing in the projects as partners we also share the concerns of paseo caribe as hdc has been part of the project
8299488 we have been working hard and the restoration is 75 completed
8299489 the work has been hard because after four years of complete abandonment it has taken us more time than expected to redo the property the site was infested and we had to clean it thoroughly it was also covered by mildew and mold not to mention that we refurbished the 18 hole golf course with the hike in construction costs and the exorbitant operational costs we face our only possibility of success is to make cayo largo an upscale hotel
8299490 thats why were being extra careful with our cayo largo project we need a brand that can embrace all the components of a high end product and we are even considering running it independently as one of the possible scenarios that is yet to be decided and because of it we are in no hurry
8299491 we already reopened three venues under our different flags el portal quality inn a 47 room hotel at condado a 99 room el tuque quality inn in ponce and le consultat on magdalena avenue in condado a 20 room boutique hotel from our clarion collection
8299492 the centro m dico project will have several meeting rooms because right now there are no meeting or group facilities there it will serve the medical community as well as the public in general we havent decided under which flag it will operate because the lease is still being negotiated we still dont know how much the investment for remodeling will be but i guess it wont be cheap when in operation it will employ 10 15 nor do we know yet the brand for the isla verde hotel and surrounding condos which is also in negotiations but it certainly will expand our visibility in puerto rico in a big way i can only say that right now it operates privately under no flag
8299493 for a 100 room hotel 25 employees will be enough but then with a casino depending on its size it will need several more employees
8299494 in march they will begin the demolition of the existing structure the former cardol discount store and in 18 months will have a four story hotel completed
8299495 were not the kind of people who say lets go to a place where there are a thousand other people from new york at the hotel
8299496 indeed this project is emblematic of our firm belief and commitment to invest in puerto rico we cant let cyclical economic changes or difficult economic times cloud our vision of a better puerto rico for future generations plaza internacional is a key component of the ciudad mayor initiative as such we will contribute with the development of a state of the art integrated facility that not only improves the quality of life in the area but also contributes by attracting new investment and creating much needed jobs
8299497 it will be a four star hotel focused on 24 hour service and a diverse offering of restaurants and entertainment options for hotel guests and comfortable rooms averaging 380 square feet to 420 square feet its ideal location only minutes away from the airport and closely located to the metro areas business district will enable the future crowne plaza to attract conventions and special events to its 20 000 square feet of meeting space including a large 11 000 square foot banquet ballroom facility
8299498 my aim in this book was for the reader to learn about puerto rico
8299499 i wanted whoever had been to this island to be able to pick up this book and recognize the culture instantly
8299500 were eliminating 95 of the comic readership by doing this but i didnt give a s
8299501 that this is where ben grimm comes for vacation because he looks like the fort if you remotely resemble anything on this island youre automatically a cult hero
8299502 we were like three school girls at a slumber party
8299503 it was this cool little p r thing we were talking about
8299504 short cultural history of p r for gringos and others
8299505 in this book we really hit on the culture i think puerto rico is probably the fifth member of the fantastic four in this piece
8299506 right now we are evaluating who will be operating those two hotels the dorado beach and cerromar we will also begin evaluating the architectural part and the main issue here will be whether its more feasible to remodel cerromar how to do the rebuilding and the extent of the demolition if it comes to that there are several main issues here to consider
8299507 all this is under evaluation we expect to have some decisions made by january in order for us to proceed
8299508 we first have to go through a design and permitting process which will probably take us all of 2008 and we will hopefully begin construction full blast by the first few months of 2009 we hope to have all the planning structured by the first quarter of next year
8299509 to be a worlds best destination you have to go large scale and thats why were being so cautious in the way we disclose information about this project
8299510 were forming sve studios p r because with a wholly owned puerto rican company we can better capitalize on the many incentives provided to film producers by the puerto rican government puerto ricos diverse topography will also allow us to produce virtually any kind of movie from a wild west ghost story to a pirates movie on the high seas puerto rico has it all working with puerto ricos already strong film production community sve studios p r s business mission is to develop the infrastructure necessary to take a film from pre production through principal photography and then wrap post production on the island this will allow us to circumvent the high cost of working with the studios and unions in hollywood and bring in additional revenue by being a one stop shop for other production companies coming to puerto rico we expect this to be the beginning of a permanent stereo vision presence in puerto rico
8299511 not to stand in the way of the work the team had already begun
8299512 were not belittling the difficulty of the times were going through theres no denying that but we have also made progress in some areas sometimes amid extremely difficult circumstances despite it all puerto rico still has many great assets and competitive advantages over other regional competitors and all of us have the responsibility of continuing to move forward for puerto ricos sake
8299513 despite all of this we were able to move forward several high impact projects four of them in the mayag ez region lockheed martin honeywell aerospace wsifb and essig research abbotts 450 million expansion in barceloneta in a former pfizer building and the expansion of recoms a local bioscience company dedicated to process validation
8299514 chief among the 2008 projects already confirmed is angiotech in aguadilla a medical devices company that will hire 559 people many of them laid off by hewlett packard theyre investing 13 million to retool a pridco building for their expansion others include coopervision in juana d az with 100 employees and a 170 million investment lockheed martin and the bioprocess plant both in mayag ez with a combined 63 million investment and microsofts 52 million digital distribution initiative
8299515 there has been a fundamental change in the way companies are supplying their products globally there has been a shift toward regional coverage from that of traditionally supplying just one jurisdiction companies are taking a regional strategy by supplying full regions as opposed to one individual country and that can change the manufacturing supply chain by shifting production to certain jurisdictions which can better supply a region
8299516 as a result we have seen a significant reduction in the number of new drug approvals in 2005 i believe the fda approved 30 new drugs in 2006 it was 31 new approvals but so far this year only 10 new approvals have been granted combine this with numerous patent expirations which far outweigh the number of new drugs in each companys pipeline and you can clearly see how this imbalance will affect manufacturing plants
8299517 many people measure the success of pridcos efforts solely on the basis of new openings but given the transitional nature of traditional manufacturing around the world retention of existing companies is just as important for every honeywell that begins operations there are many like lifescan already operating here that we have to fight hard to keep from leaving for ireland or other emerging markets we were able to do a lot in 2007 despite difficult times and a nearly expired industrial incentives act
8299518 theyre going through a very comprehensive restructuring process but their commitment to puerto rico remains firm
8299519 our task ahead will be more of a balancing act maintaining what we have while rapidly establishing the kind of infrastructure that will enable us to insert puerto rico in the knowledge economy as a leading competitor our world class high skilled and bilingual labor force coupled with decades of leadership in the manufacturing industry will serve as the launching pad of our biotech and life science industry
8299520 with one million square feet of new laboratory space in addition to various existing lab facilities around the island and the 30 000 square feet of lab space in the new mayag ez facility we will jump right to the major leagues of the biotech and life sciences industry up until now we didnt have the kind of capital needed to effectively compete on a global scale the land transfer capitalizes the trust for future construction which in turn guarantees an ongoing source of income to support our quest to become bioisland
8299521 large municipalities received matching funds a dollar for each dollar they invested whereas smaller municipalities got their initiative under way in partnership with manufacturing companies and trade organizations who donate in kind services staff and equipment
8299522 we are looking at various solutions to identify funds for more researchers meanwhile as part of the legislative effort to approve a new economic incentives law were also recommending relevant tax exemptions credits recruitment subsidies and other incentives not only to attract but to retain the worlds top scientists
8299523 with 4 581 new rooms already under way were 93 closer to our 5 000 new room goal and well have the rest secured before year end
8299524 last year was a tough year but we managed to make progress in each of our strategic areas hotel development air access marketing product development and customer service were on track with our first bond issue which will help us capitalize the hotel development corp and participate as facilitators in the development of top projects as we increase our room inventory weve attracted renowned hotel flags including our first three five star hotels compared to none just four years ago
8299525 after last years tourism investment forum we received many calls from local property or land owners expressing their interest in selling their real estate through our catalog each property will be evaluated on its merit to make sure it fits with the development strategy for that particular region
8299526 the fastest growing numbers in hotel occupancy in puerto rico are coming from this region in 2005 2006 the area registered a 4 4 increase in hotel occupancy and last year 2007 averaged 69 3 even higher than the islands 68 4 average
8299527 one of the most challenging aspects of expanding our air access has been the decentralization of airport arrivals meaning creating opportunities for more and more passengers to fly into aguadilla or ponce instead of luis mu oz mar n international airport in isla verde the 4 million fund created for this purpose has helped us secure 29 new flights to regional airports with an economic impact of 120 million to complement the tourism development initiatives in porta del sol and porta caribe but theres still more work to do in this area clearly hotel development within those regions must also continue to meet passenger projected demand
8299528 again our difficult economic situation coupled with signs of trouble with the stateside economy has forced us to be more aggressive in marketing this has also opened up opportunities to diversify our tourism product as we saw with the puerto rico open the salsa congress saborea gourmet festival the culebra heineken international regatta and many other opportunities despite difficult times porta del sol registered an 8 5 increase in nonresident registrations and porta caribe 5 which points to the need of increasing room inventory in those regions as well
8299529 indeed the economic situation has slowed down slot machine and casino revenue in general but it will not impact the bond issue we will proceed as planned
8299530 in addition to the recession which has impacted the industry as a whole well continue to partner with the treasury department to fight illegal video games which is truly putting a dent in casino profits
8299531 efforts are very advanced and many of the strategies included in the branding platform have been outlined i do believe we will see a unified branding initiative for puerto rico soon with the support of various industry sectors i think it will work precisely because of the involvement of the private sector from day one however consensus on this subject is crucial to make sure all puerto ricans understand what the brand is all about rally around it and most importantly feel empowered to promote the brand accordingly
8299532 we continue with our ongoing maintenance and repairs program top security and new feasibility studies to develop the centers second phase for additional capacity
8299533 which well accommodate with outdoor tents also our coordination of citywide conventions has gotten very effective with shuttle services to and from the convention center and hotels in the entire san juan metro area
8299534 as room inventory within the district increases we will also be able to increase our service capacity
8299535 were also evaluating construction of the second hotel in the area a marriott courtyard even the sheraton is considering an additional 250 rooms once it inaugurates its first phase bringing the areas total room inventory to 1 000
8299536 every year the quality of events goes up making it a very exciting venue for all puerto rican and foreign promoters this year well see a great disney on ice show thats second to none and anything with the disney franchise name represents an important vote of confidence in our venue
8299537 the most important aspect of this program is what we call capturing where we help entrepreneurs prepare to become successful business owners from the 30 hour business plan course to the advanced course where the person validates his or her business plan after completing a 12 hour business administration course
8299538 while 2007 was a difficult year for many sectors puerto ricos small and midsize businesses effectively competed helping the economy move forward under our flagship program we secured more than 800 new businesses for puerto rico that represent an investment of 36 million and more than 9 000 new jobs
8299539 at our cetpymes the fast track permit processing centers for small businesses we try to eliminate the guessing and complications often associated with the permit process at cetpymes the business can process its valid permits from the regulations amp permits administration arpe the health department and the trade co in 20 days down from 120 prior to the new fast track permit system since the program began last september we have reviewed more than 13 000 cases approved 11 998 plus another 1 000 subject to some conditions
8299540 through the single certification process all of the participating agencies can view the profile of the company and facilitate communication and payment processes when doing business with the government
8299541 the combined results of these trade missions have a projected sales potential of 32 million among the 251 companies that participated
8299542 as we make our operations more efficient by leveraging the international offices currently in the dominican republic costa rica panama chile and spain facilitating access to more local companies in the free trade zone program directing our international trade missions to potential markets and helping new exporters through puerto rico exporta the greater our return on investment is from trade and export activities
8299543 the strike certainly slowed down our production but we are back on track with 32 projects in the pipeline including short films another challenge we face is insurance given our tropical weather and somewhat limited filming period and because of our hurricane season productions tend to line up their projects during the first half of the year so we are working on other programs like the one to develop new screenwriters or special collaborations like the popular chilean novela soap opera that is being shot on the island in the area of dorado with both puerto rican and chilean actors
8299544 the land administration has the unique opportunity to participate in a myriad of diverse development projects last year our efforts contributed to advancing the development of the san juan waterfront primarily by making possible two such key projects as harbor plaza adjacent to the ochoa building with a 130 million investment and capitolio plaza also in the area which has finished its first tower with a 50 million investment and is set to start the second tower for an additional 90 million
8299545 our current development pipeline includes seven major projects with a combined investment of 450 million over the next two years and from the tourism end were working with the prtc on the development of the tourism real estate catalog which includes the development of such projects as la pared de luquillo and luc a estate in yabucoa in many instances we secure all the permits for the proposed development and turn them over to the developers so they are ready to start construction
8299546 first we had to determine which specific properties were available after that determination dtop had to establish the property location size title liens if any on the property any drawings available in their files description of structures if any on the property past and present use and other relevant information necessary for the sale
8299547 after puerto ricos double victory in the caribbean classic we have become its official and permanent home that makes us very proud but also opens up a myriad of development and training opportunities for our local breeders as well as potential jockeys
8299548 weve seen a strong start to 2008 on the betting side and after six years we have secured funding and resources to operate la esmeralda equine park in the south region of the island
8299549 the big problem in the 1940s and 50s was that we had too many people
8299550 the island was overpopulated and now ironically it may be the reverse to the extent puerto ricans migrate to the mainland u s where the economy may have better prospects it will actually make the situation worse
8299551 when birthrates and populations decline and the dependent population mainly seniors outpace workers an economy usually enters a long period of stagnation and reduced living standards
8299552 thats the risk now faced by puerto rico within the next 20 years
8299553 developed countries at least got a chance to grow rich before they grew old today most developing countries are growing old before they get rich
8299554 on the consumer side the steep rise in 65 will depress consumer demand as seniors either will not have the disposable income to spend much or will not have the need to spend even if they have the income or savings
8299555 this whole trend will drag down median purchasing power and therefore overall sales on the island put a significant strain on government coffers higher social spending and a smaller tax base and otherwise hurt prospects for economic growth and prosperity
8299556 the sales and growth crisis will spread to other product categories and the economy as a whole
8299557 will probably increase the labor participation rate or the proportion of people between 16 and 65 who are in the work force since younger people generally have lower participation rates
8299558 from a labor standpoint companies that dont prepare now for this situation that is coming will not last in the market
8299559 given the dwindling number of people who will be available in the local talent pool those who are available may not necessarily have the required skill sets required by companies
8299560 the majority of students are women which means that 15 to 20 years from now there will be more women than men in the labor force
8299561 because more women will be working they will have fewer children as happens with most women who work today this will further contribute to declines in population and ultimately in the labor pool
8299562 puerto rico is not ready for this type of change
8299563 i dont see the government taking any steps to prepare for this which will negatively affect us if no action is taken the one thing in our favor now is that were still on time to prepare
8299564 the government will have to reorient its focus toward the growing elderly population
8299565 for example primary education costs will have to be reduced from now until 2025 and government priorities will have to be refocused to address the needs of the aging population such as health issues
8299566 the elderly population have all sorts of needs and therefore it creates markets that at this time may not exist
8299567 for example housing for the elderly becomes an interesting market as well as services to care for the elderly things like cruise ships which is an attractive vacation option traditionally popular among older individuals
8299568 so you have a bigger market for this sort of entertainment the population shift presents lots of challenges but also lots of opportunities
8299569 we need to work on keeping our doctors on the island and on training our medical staff in geriatrics in order to keep pace with the demand
8299570 in puerto rico we have a problem with long term planning and this is one of those issues where everybody sees that problems are brewing ahead but they say it is too far away
8299571 if nothing is done it could mean a severe economic slowdown we will have a big portion of the population without the means to support itself and an economy that will not be able to grow because there will not be enough labor to support growth this demographic alert should be on top of the priority list
8299572 we are doing a pre opening ceremony to thank all the people involved in the project from carpenters to engineers and their families it is a very special occasion because it marks the beginning of our paseo gastron mico de san germ n or san germ n gastronomic route a concept that includes three more restaurants around the town square that will be developed and managed by interpec next on the list is o dougalls authentic irish pub a concept we also developed on the mainland that should be ready by next summer because it doesnt need construction and all the equipment has been ordered it will employ 18 people
8299573 for the 500th anniversary of the discovery of america my sons and i came up with a theme that fuses spanish mexican and american cuisine this will be the biggest of all our restaurants with two levels and 235 seats and approximately 50 employees and last but not least will be pink lobster a seafood restaurant that will seat 175 people and employ 35 people
8299574 because our prices will be the same in puerto rico and the mainland our meats will be top choice always fresh not frozen and our lobsters will be from maine although we are going to be profitable we will always be thinking of delivering the best quality at the lowest price to our customers there is no way people wont want to come to san germ n the best food at the best price and the scenery alone is worth the trip
8299575 the fast track permit process worked well they followed up with pending documents and helped move projects from one reviewing agency to the next expediting the overall process we hope the new permits system scheduled to be in place within a month or so follows some of the same processing principles of the task force
8299576 these projects are extremely important for puerto rico because they help keep the economy moving forward with much needed construction jobs new permanent jobs and retail sales what i like the most about these developments is that theyre small to mid size commercial centers located throughout the island in areas where the local community truly needs those services
8299577 prior to 2006 the local office market was very stable with vacancy rates in the range of 8 to 10 since 2006 however the prime office real estate market has been increasing its vacancy rate to a level of 14 and up to 16 in some cases
8299578 in order to compete many landlords remodeled while having to keep the same rents or in some cases reducing these in reaction to the local market situation
8299579 the construction costs are higher and since demand is slowing the vacancy ratio will certainly grow even more
8299580 banks are more careful in the analysis of their clients capacity to repay loans and this will further restrict the financing alternative for user buyers on the other hand the decrease in interest rates and stable market values make the current commercial real estate market a buyers market
8299581 this would double the number of existing class a and b buildings commercial banks indirectly control construction by approving loans to developers that have leased at least 50 or more of a building but how do we control the space that is left behind the natural balance in the real estate market forecasts that prices will inevitably go down
8299582 sometimes that serves as an excuse to put a young man in jail when he needs a different kind of treatment
8299583 in puerto rico thats an issue that nobody wants to touch
8299584 its a proposal that we should be open to discussing
8299585 its very simple dvd piracy is stealing and therefore a crime every time an individual buys a duplicate dvd copy he or she becomes an accomplice in that criminal enterprise
8299586 this illegal activity which will be prosecuted is wiping out years of hard work to position puerto rico as a top film market
8299587 independent film making is a tough and competitive business as it is mostly due to limited financing options
8299588 puerto rico releases have been simultaneous with those on the mainland u s however it could take weeks or even months to reach some latin american markets by the time releases get there our puerto ricos black market distributors would have sold thousands of copies in advance killing chances of box office success in those markets
8299589 the local black market has gotten so big that it is having an impact on stateside revenues film studios find themselves fighting illegal online sales and movie file sharing even before films hit stateside theaters
8299590 so far my distribution hasnt been affected but as soon as sonys legal department deems it appropriate to hold back a release to protect its investment it can do just that
8299591 if a blockbuster film is distributed before release time our chances to recoup our investment are greatly reduced
8299592 this has an impact on movie theaters since they depend on moviegoers and concession sales to maintain operations the video division also feels the impact since black market copies reduce movie rentals and even dvd sales
8299593 remains vigilant inside our theaters and will report any suspicious activity in the end moviegoers are the ones inconvenienced
8299594 we organized the conference around the many areas of interest to investors in which puerto rico offers unique opportunities
8299595 the response so far has been very positive we are getting a lot of interest from investors in the u s and puerto rico
8299596 our mission is to showcase puerto ricos business sector and its many possibilities as we strengthen it with this type of event
8299597 puerto ricos food industry track record during the past two years is best described as impressive and somewhat unprecedented with some 125 to 150 new food establishments opened during that period of time i do not know of any other industry sector within our local economy that continues to grow at the rate of the local food industry
8299598 our food industry is a great example and a solid business case study of what entrepreneurs can do when market conditions get tough we got creative sought greater efficiency increased product diversity secured better technology applications to facilitate operations and delivered better service most importantly we faced the competition head on instead of retreating ourselves instead of being afraid of the proverbial big bad wolf as so many describe the megastores
8299599 instead the majority of our food retailers wholesalers and food distributors chose to put up a good and fair battle and today theyre not only growing but giving some of these large companies a good run for their money
8299600 the story of our supermarket industry is that of one that has grown thanks to the entrepreneurial spirit of our people folks who recognize that theres only one constant in our business and that constant is change those who have their ears to the ground who are hands on in their business and keep abreast of the latest trends both locally and worldwide can anticipate local changes and decide whether to adapt or not
8299601 many of those who in the early 1990s refused to change are no longer around to tell their story fortunately the majority of our local key players recognized the arrival of the multinationals well in advance and thanks to their entrepreneurial spirit and preparedness they have made our food industry stronger than ever i bet the multinationals never thought our local entrepreneurs would be as smart and resilient as they are
8299602 the fact that we continue to grow is not only a good indication that even when things get tough if we organize ourselves we can thrive and succeed most importantly i think puerto ricos food industry leads by example in what it means to bet on puerto rico to keep reinvesting in the local economy and not stand by waiting for what can or should be given to us but rather going after what we want in the end by strengthening our food industry were making puerto ricos economy more financially solid and we are laying fertile ground for other industries to do the same
8299603 puerto ricos food industry is a dynamic changing and proactive industry most importantly it is a customer driven industry where the voice of the consumer is very much a part of the way we do business todays consumers are more sophisticated and knowledgeable about products nutritional values and other industry trends consumers have also become more demanding regarding price convenience store appeal and security given the hectic lives most puerto ricans live they also prefer to meet their food needs with as few visits to the store as possible and get what they need all in one place
8299604 if i had to do it all over again id do it exactly the same way
8299605 i have the utmost respect for our local food industry its a tough business but it keeps puerto rico healthy and the economy moving forward im honored to be a part of it
8299606 as a matter of fact one of my first calls after acquiring pueblo was to mr toppel whom i consider a mentor he was moved by the gesture and of course willing to help in any way he could
8299607 meanwhile we continue to invest to bring the stores to optimum conditions next in line is the reconstruction of 94 000 lineal feet of refrigerators and well continue to deliver the best service the food industry has something amazing happens when you can hire back so many employees who had lost their jobs they come back with greater appreciation for what it means to come to work every day i have no doubt i have the most motivated workforce on the island
8299608 whatever you do in life do it with passion thats the secret whether its mopping the floor or running a multimillion dollar corporation
8299609 our strength comes from our union its as simple as that
8299610 we are the most diverse group of entrepreneurs working together in puerto rico each one of us is an owner operator thats why we pour our hearts and energy into our stores to make sure we stay in touch with the clients needs at all times collectively were a force to be reckoned with
8299611 i see no limits to what econo can do as i said earlier our strength comes from our union and the cohesiveness we find as we come together as a family a family of 32 individual owners members things can happen and if one of our stores faces difficulties and has to close that is unfortunate but we will continue to work together to avoid that from ever happening you can throw one of us out but you cant throw all of us out so econo is going to be around for a long time
8299612 yes the acquisition of pueblo could have facilitated some of the plans we have especially to grow our distribution to keep pace with the stores growth but by no means will we stop growing were already working on expansion plans for our distribution center and more stores
8299613 for a moment think about the strength and soundness our industry has at the time of pueblos bidding process not one or two or even three but rather four local companies were in a position to successfully acquire the pueblo stores thats fantastic and true testimony that puerto ricos food industry is one of the most solid industries in our local economy to date
8299614 as an industry we couldnt have let the closing of pueblo go without doing something about it as a sector we are stronger and better because pueblo can continue to operate
8299615 the fact of the matter is that the expansion of supermarket chains stateside and local alike has brought a greater level of convenience to even some of the most remote areas around the island that many years ago relied on the colmaditos for their main grocery shopping nowadays not only roads are better and cars more prevalent but supermarkets are more accessible and convenient for consumers
8299616 that is not to say however that competition from larger formats like megastores and food clubs hasnt contributed to the segments market share decline but it has not been the only factor
8299617 what we have noticed however is that small businesses have not switched entirely to purchasing their weekly provisions from the traditional wholesalers they are visiting both the grocery wholesaler and the food club
8299618 iris observations indicate many of the small businesses will purchase beverages and paper products at the food club when on sale for example yet buy the bulk of their other provisions from the traditional grocery wholesaler
8299619 i am not afraid of anyone as a matter of fact whenever possible id like to open a ralphs wherever the megastores have one of theirs initially i was seriously criticized when i decided to jump into this industry segment at a time when many key players were leaving i realized that even before megastores arrived puerto rico still had underserved areas i decided to prepare for their arrival adapt to new market conditions and compete and compete we have
8299620 i figured we needed spacious and modern locations to serve customers the way they deserved i decided to establish the warehouse operation adjacent to the retail supermarket and serve both types of customers at the same time that way i leverage the investment and logistics of the warehouse and could supply my retail stores from my own warehouse immediately without delays and at convenient prices
8299621 i still see tremendous growth opportunities i have yet to go to guaynabo bayam n and on to r o grande can vanas and lo za
8299622 the key to success is to work every day remain involved in every aspect of the business educate yourself about the latest industry trends and maintain the greatest variety competitive prices and best service
8299623 the industry has been transforming over the past 10 to 15 years as key players adapt they have chosen different ways to compete from a revised version of the traditional cash amp carry to new hybrid concepts or others who have completely migrated toward the retail end of the industry we have stayed with the traditional cash amp carry format but carrying packaging options that some of the larger food clubs cant or dont do has given us an important competitive edge some of the large food clubs like sams club owned by wal mart operate a food club but also serve individual customers we only want to serve small business owners and make sure we give them the tools to continue growing their businesses
8299624 we have also been very successful with our el criollazo marketing program through it clients are feature in our shopper and can also advertise their store locations we also place banners and develop other point of sale materials for them
8299625 the best example of how we better serve our customers through el criollazo is the volume discounts we can pass on to our customers so that a local drugstore like farmacia ruiz belvis can sell a two liter coca cola bottle for seventy nine cents like the large supermarket chains
8299626 most importantly as long as they remain competitive in their service and the type of packaging options they can offer theyll always have a solid market to serve they need to continue increasing their variety and diversifying their service by expanding delivery operation hours and even offering credit options to facilitate payment all of these measures will go a long way to serve the islands small businesses and colmaditos which are vital in the food sales chain for thousands of families
8299627 were truly excited about the construction of this integrated facility this not only represents an important investment in the future of our company but a vote of confidence about the future of our industry and puerto rico
8299628 we have excellent competitors and that helps us all keep the industry growing and moving forward
8299629 when wal mart decided to come to puerto rico it was because it saw an opportunity to bring its everyday low prices philosophy to the local retail market that successful formula was extended to the food industry segment and we have been extremely successful there too
8299630 but what were most proud of is our record of excellence in all aspects of the operations which not only affords us the opportunity to deliver everyday low prices but provide the best service to our customers by doing so we have elevated the industrys standards and competitive level only resulting in a stronger industry and with greater advantages for consumers
8299631 this is one of the programs that were particular proud of our suppliers partners program whereby we can sell excellent quality merchandise from local manufacturers and distributors which allows us to reinvest in the local economy and help local businesses grow
8299632 in fact some of our suppliers have not only placed their products through our local operations but companies such as arroz rico carlas sweets and a whole series of fresh produce products are now introduced and sold through our wal mart stores in other markets
8299633 delivers traditional mexican dishes with a twist more like tex mex combined with an american influence typically found at border locations between mexico and the u s
8299634 the whole corillo staff from ir just got back from dallas where we had a chance to taste the entire menu and go through the on the border experience im convinced puerto rico not only will like the concept but will enjoy the blend of good food affordable dining and an entertaining ambiance
8299635 our original plan with chilis was to open five locations in five years we ended up with eight within that time and are now up to 15
8299636 we will include a hydrogen station that residents and guests can use for their hydrogen propelled vehicles
8299637 we have already initiated talks with some manufacturers that have prototypes for this type of car like bmw mercedes benz toyota honda and volkswagen
8299638 divided in two sectors the first is about 46 acres and is on the west side of the property along the esp ritu santo river the second area is about 44 acres and is also on the west side of the property next to the service parcel to secure the protection of this land our family created a title deed called a perpetuity natural reserve
8299639 we not only view our property as a beautiful place to live and play golf but as an important representation of puerto rico this has been my dream for many years a part of our family and we treat it as such that is why we want to create the most positive visual and environmental impact on the area
8299640 what most people dont know about the trump development is that since the beginning my grandfather has been concerned about the environment actually way before i started working with this project three years ago it was my uncle who was working closely with the u s fish amp wildlife service particularly to conserve coco beachs mangroves and wetlands for us this is more of a family project than merely a commercial one
8299641 i brought a special friend a great american success story
8299642 hes from puerto rico married 15 years and has children ages 14 12 and 10
8299643 puerto rico has always been an area of interest to us and were very excited about bringing our great assortment of merchandise to puerto rican consumers who happen to be very fashion savvy and price conscious a perfect market fit for burlingtons brand labels at value prices
8299644 most importantly with each of our stores we should help create about 100 full time and part time new jobs and in such difficult economic times the savings we bring for our consumers will be greatly appreciated
8299645 definitely burlington is about a lot more than coats but thats how we started and have evolved into a retail one stop shop for the entire family since we shop the world for our coats we carry more than 200 different lines of coats we know our selection of coats will still be ideal for college students those who travel to cold weather for business or pleasure
8299646 we feel puerto rico is the natural next step as we continue to connect with our core customer young men and women
8299647 the energy of the teens in puerto rico mixed with our excitement for being here will prove the right fit
8299648 with the anticipation of the opening growing as well as the companys success in the united sates we know aeropostale will becomes a teen favorite in puerto rico
8299649 this is one of the developments were most excited about
8299650 the fact that this significant effort is not only going to attract new retailers but also give our own local stores the opportunities to grow with them is wonderful the capri store one of our main tenants will relocate and take an even larger retail space
8299651 we offer both types of coffee at the mall and theyre both successful the starbucks concept is a retail experience customers are willing to pay for whereas coffee drinkers who love puerto rican coffee are likely not to switch by adding starbucks to our tenant mix we simply expand the choices we offer our clients
8299652 were very excited about our new location which features the chains new store design beyond the retail cases this store is a self treat location featuring our line of chocolate frozen drinks our chocolate dipped jumbo strawberries the customized assorted chocolate boxes and our popular chocolixir already a best seller
8299653 that this scales heights of presumptuousness can hardly be refuted what genius thought of this motif
8299654 obama wants to treat us the way apollo treated the enterprise crew as children who need do nothing but gather food and worship him he promises them peace tranquility and happiness as long as they agree to become his servants and relinquish their free will in the end kirk and his crew destroy his power source and send him off to his fellow demigods in bitterness rather than allow themselves to become enslaved to apollo somehow i think that american voters will understand those parallels even if theyve never seen this episode before in their lives
8299655 the families have accepted compensation payments they have to accept the money because the police can be very terrifying
8299656 when they accept the money they are told to keep quiet we have all been told not to accept interviews with the media
8299657 it is not convenient for me to speak to you now please dont call
8299658 it is clear that poor construction was a problem why didnt other buildings here collapse
8299659 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8299660 theres a strong chance that by friday we could see some fairly significant pump price increases
8299661 crude can be replaced and brought in via tanker but bringing a damaged refinery back up again can take a long time as we saw with katrina and rita
8299662 were getting some pretty powerful data that suggests slower growth and higher gasoline prices have really crimped oil demand in the u s
8299663 i think gustav is overshadowing the eia report it doesnt appear to having an impact
8299664 i think what we see is a lot of confusion right now im not sure investors really know what to do youve got oil jumping all over the place

8299679 as weve said negotiations are ongoing and we are not going to get into the details until an agreement is concluded
8299680 we hope that there will be flexibility and understanding from the two parties in order to reach an agreement

8299707 today we subscribe to the alba to culture and to dignity to make hondurans a free people
8299708 honduras and the honduran people do not have to ask permission of any imperialism to join the alba
8299709 i did not come here to meddle in internal affairs but i am just reflecting and i cannot explain how a honduran could be against honduras joining the alba the path of development the path of integration
8299710 is the first summit in honduras and perhaps in the region where the witnesses are not only the top political leaders but also different sectors of the people who not only endorse the alba but also feel that an old historical debt is being paid
8299711 i have been looking for projects with the world bank the inter american development bank europe and i have found very prudent moderated responses
8299712 they do not have emergency funds and this obligates us to move toward new forms of finance like the alba

8299723 mozillas new initiative uses an implementation technique called just in time compilation that delivers significantly greater speed
