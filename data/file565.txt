5650000 appearing 11 times and scoring his debut goal in the home reverse against birmingham city injury interrupted his first full season with the club however he did appear as an unused substitute in the final premier league game of the season
5650001 the club did a lot to get me here and they fought so hard to get my work permit i thank them so much and i am happy to be here
5650002 i cannot wait to meet the fans and to go on the pitch with my team mates
5650003 there is always a lot of pressure in each game i am going to play there will be a lot of pressure but i am ready and here to work if im selected to play then im going to be there in the thick of things
5650004 what the coach is good at is bringing the team together and thats the most important thing
5650005 ill play with passion ive come here because i love the coach and i want to play for the fans and the president
5650006 he is over his injury and will be soon showing his talent for the team
5650007 in the past i always felt that the team was picked before we met up but i dont think there are any automatic choices now it doesnt matter who you play for if you are good enough you get in
5650008 fabio capello is very fair and im looking forward to the chance to be involved against the czech republic at wembley
5650009 its a very professional setup when you are with the squad and that is the way it should be i wouldnt say its frightening its an atmosphere of respect
5650010 its enjoyable and the coach will have banter with you his english is fairly good better than what you might think from watching him on the telly

5650026 i remember the birmingham game and what happened to eduardo the lads were winning 2 1 but then in the last minute gael gave away a really stupid penalty
5650027 there were an awful lot of other similarly negative things happening everything began with eduardos injury then came gaels error and that thing with william
5650028 you could say that was probably where the ground started to crumble beneath our feet
5650029 he played brilliantly all season he improved immensely and turned into a great defender as a result but he messed up that day
5650030 it was not an easy situation on the other hand it was williams first season as captain and its not easy to wear the armband in a team like this
5650031 i think he will have learned there were things he could have done better but he knows that better than anyone else
5650032 hes really immersed in everything and that was something he just got immersed in too deeply but otherwise hes a good leader in my opinion and he will continue to be captain even though there was speculation about that
5650033 i havent changed my mind i want to join everton

5650120 were setting up the sweetwater casino that day many of the employees and the customers all the familiar faces will be there
5650121 i had my doubts this would happen after the fire
5650122 this solidifies for me why we liked going to sweetwater it was the employees the way they interpreted their jobs their hearts were in the right place
5650123 it was an effort by our company to say sweetwater doesnt exist right now but its time to come together as a community to help a child in need

5650181 we express our deep felt sympathy and support to the thousands of internally displaced persons in the vanni mainland and our strong condemnation against the sri lanka government for continually unleashing severe military and aerial offensives on the people of vanni
5650182 the jaffna university society is observing this silent protest at a time when freedom of speech and freedom of expression are denied to the residents of jaffna peninsula
5650183 the government has systematically and very effectively cut off all connections between vanni and the outer world to carry on its scheme of annihilating the people in vanni in the dark in its next phase of an offensives onslaught

5650187 there ought to be a common basis for decisions about exceptional circumstances anybody who uses the nhs for their care is entitled to expect that
5650188 what patients need to do is to find out from those who are making the decision what the basis of that decision is and if they dont think its reasonable if they dont think it compares appropriately with decisions that are taken elsewhere ask why not

5650202 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
5650203 is looking at a very bad period in the future because a lot of their big earners are going off patent
5650204 are looking at a 30 or 40 reduction in the next five years unless they come up with new drugs
5650205 the share price is very important to a pharmaceutical company
5650206 and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
5650207 its not in their interests to take less profit personally as well as from the point of view of the business all these perverse incentives drive the price up
5650208 the other thing we have to pay for is the costs of marketing
5650209 traditionally the pharmaceutical industry will admit that they actually charged what they think the market will bear the wiser ones are recognising that that model is no longer available
5650210 pharmaceutical companies invest an average of more than 500 million over more than a decade to bring new medicines to patients
5650211 their investors will not support this and the supply of modern medicines that enhance and save lives will dry up
5650212 what nice fails to mention is that the medicines in question are in common use elsewhere in europe where prices are typically higher than they are here in the uk
5650213 nice has an important job to do but they need to adapt their approach for cancer medicines rather than lay the blame on the process and economics of pharmaceutical innovation
5650214 protherics notes todays rise in the companys share price and confirms it has received approaches from a number of parties interested in acquiring protherics which the board is considering however there can be no certainty that any formal offer will be made nor as to the terms on which any offer might be made a further announcement will be made in due course
5650215 for as many are led by the spirit of god these are the the sons of god
5650216 god is spirit and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth
5650217 and my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men but in the power of god for our gospel did not come to you in word only but also in power and in the holy spirit

5650221 i got the call on a friday night and two hours later i was in a car going to the team hotel so i didnt have much time to think about it or get nervous

5650310 i had nearly been run over the previous day by a car going through the no entry signs so i was a bit miffed when a police van did the same thing
5650311 he reversed into the road rather than going round the block and coming in the other way like the rest of us have to
5650312 i went home and got my camera i took a photo of the van and then a picture of the officer through the window of the chip shop

5650344 we are aware of their qualities but this is one game we want to deal with quickly and firmly and we are determined to take no prisoners
5650345 we came here to china to achieve something at the olympic football tournament we knew we wouldnt find it easy in the first few games but were getting stronger all the time
5650346 we have confidence that we can deal with this game but we respect the opposition even as we set our sights on the final
5650347 what i said was unfair to john comitis after what he has done for me all these years
5650348 i joined ajax as a 15 year old and the club has always been good to me if i had a problem with the club i should have approached comitis and not run to the media first now i think i need to be honest with myself and face my wrong doings by apologising to the club
5650349 after the article was published i went through what i said word by word and when i read it i realised what i said was harsh and uncalled for i spoke out of anger after failing a trial in holland and unfortunately what i did was wrong but now its time to leave the past behind and focus on the forthcoming season
5650350 the agreement is centered on helping the nfl to create the information technology platform required to support international standard statistics generation match data management content provision and other vital e business activities for the nfl
5650351 i am happy to be back after a long wait
5650352 the club did a lot to get me here and they fought so hard to get my work permit i thank them so much i cannot wait to meet the fans and to go on the pitch with the team
5650353 in each game i am going to play there will be a lot of pressure but i am ready and if selected to play on saturday
5650354 he is now injury free and good additional to the team
5650355 sincerely speaking i think their not too impressive game against usa where the coach and almost everybody were not impressed really fired up the boys to play a wonderful game against the ivory coast i am really happy for the boys and i also say a big congratulations to nigerians
5650356 i will however advise the team not to underrate belgium a team that could eliminate italy in a big competition like this should not and never be underrated
5650357 if they can play the way they played on saturday then i see nigeria gradually moving to the promised land of being in the final where they would be able to have a shot at winning the gold medal of the soccer event in the olympics

5650436 puuuuh nu skal jeg vist ikke have mere at drikke jeg synes jeg er begyndt at se dobbelt
5650437 we think this years high earnings growth will not be sustainable into next year
5650438 next year the banks may face higher credit costs and that may lower earnings growth
5650439 the positive earnings revision cycle over the past 12 months looks to be ending as nims net interest margins are reaching a plateau and credit risks are rising as chinas economy faces potentially greater than expected slowdown risks
5650440 the odd bit of profit taking maybe but i think the stakes theyve got are quite unique and they wouldnt be in a rush to sell unless they were really financially stretched

5650449 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5650450 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

5650459 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5650460 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5650461 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5650462 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5650463 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5650464 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5650465 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5650466 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5650467 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

5650485 socavar la democracia de georgia a usar su capacidad militar para da ar y en algunos casos destruir las infraestructuras y a debilitar el estado georgiano
5650486 esto es un juego muy peligroso y quiz los rusos quieren reconsiderarlo
5650487 no permitiremos que rusia dibuje una nueva l nea de separaci n en los estados que a n no est n integrados en la estructura transat ntica como georgia desconoce lo que los ministros de exteriores decidir n en la reuni n extraordinaria pero s adelant que hablar n
5650488 tenemos que rechazar los objetivos estrat gicos de rusia que estaban claramente encaminados a socavar la democracia de georgia a usar su capacidad militar para da ar y en algunos casos destruir las infraestructuras y a debilitar el estado georgiano
5650489 rusia no puede tener las dos cosas no puede actuar como lo hizo en la guerra fr a y esperar que se le trate como un socio responsable al mismo tiempo
5650490 es un estado que desafortunadamente usa el instrumento que siempre ha utilizado que es la fuerza militar

5650493 this regional emphasis program rep was established as an enforcement initiative for the inspection of cranes used in construction with the goal of preventing serious and fatal injuries to employees working on and around cranes
5650494 the rep will address various hazards associated with cranes including but not limited to being struck by objects electrocution crane tip over being caught in or between machinery and falls past inspection evidence indicates these hazards are the leading causes of accidents where cranes are used in the construction industry
5650495 one of my colleagues used to work for a company that decided it needed to downsize the company took the bizarre step of announcing who would be laid off in stages with each announcement coming on a friday the 13th this creates fear and tension among employees and also creates an us vs them mentality there werent any disasters on that occasion but its not hard to imagine tensions boiling over
5650496 if you need to lay this type of person off its important to be very explicit about why they were chosen and why this was a logical decision if its because of economic reasons be very clear that its because of economic reasons otherwise the tendency to believe theyre out to get me often takes over
5650497 one of the worst things you can do is create ambiguity while the managers might think they are sparing feelings they are also giving ex employees an opportunity to spin conspiracy theories which fuel anger and resentment be kind and respectful but also as candid as possible
5650498 a big problem with these reactions is that they dont always go away once the stress is reduced people become addicted to alcohol or irreparably harm their reputation at work or their relationships with family members
5650499 fortunately the really dramatic stress related incidents like workplace shootings are rare
5650500 reducing bad stress often can be done by reducing bureaucracy and listening to employees concerns to see if they can be addressed
5650501 what you generally dont want to do is try to reduce employees overall stress levels by taking away the good stress the aspects of a job they find enjoyable and energizing

5650524 we are hoping to match landowners who want a good deer harvest with antlerless whitetail and mule deer hunters looking for a place to hunt
5650525 we have worked with several dozen landowners in the past and most have reported good success in matching up with doe hunters
5650526 these landowners have contacted us and asked for help in reducing the deer population in their areas
5650527 were happy to direct some hunters to them but we dont want them to be overrun either this is the reason we have developed and set up the contact list

5650541 an association between byetta and acute pancreatitis is suspected in some of these cases
5650542 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5650543 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5650544 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5650545 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5650546 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5650547 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5650548 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5650549 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5650550 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5650551 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5650552 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5650553 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5650554 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5650555 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5650556 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

5650558 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5650559 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5650560 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5650561 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5650562 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5650563 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5650564 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5650565 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5650566 as my mother in law has expired and i am only one responsible for it please grant me 10 days leave
5650567 as i am studying in this school i am suffering from headache i request you to leave me today

5650570 that was 1982 i was a windows user for the next 20 years
5650571 i love that damn phone and it will take a lot more than lost apps and dropped calls to get it out of my hands
5650572 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5650573 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5650574 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5650575 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5650576 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5650577 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5650578 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5650579 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5650580 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5650581 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5650582 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5650583 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5650584 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5650585 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5650586 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5650587 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5650588 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5650589 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5650590 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5650595 we received information of probable attacks in various places in a lot more places that were attacked we were able to secure some of the places of course we all know that it is not possible that our soldiers will secure every single town of mindanao and based on their assessment there were places that were more vulnerable and there are places with higher threats and these areas were secured
5650596 what happened was that the milf assembled its forces and our intelligence were able to monitor but they had choice of which town to attack depending on how vulnerable these town is to their offensive so they probably chose the towns which were less manned by government forces
5650597 we consider them as criminals in every sense of the word because they have committed atrocities and violations of our laws and we will treat them as such as criminals
5650598 that is the reason why the investigation is ongoing as what we have done in north cotabato where we filed initially a case for serious illegal detention against umbra kato after which the other cases for ransom multiple murder and robbery will be filed anytime either today tuesday or within the week we shall also do the same in the case of the lanao norte incident
5650599 i think the situation is serious enough for the president to call for a multi secetoral and a wide ranging group of leaders who can advise on this particular problem that is currently afflicting mindanao
5650600 we feel that mindanao is something that should be viewed even beyond political considerations we will invite everybody because this should be a concern for all
5650601 it can be a congressional action it can be an action by the executive and it can be an action by the stakeholders by the sectoral representatives this would be a big group coming together and discussing collectively now the situation in mindanao
5650602 can take up any issue that will be necessary for a good discussion of the issues
5650603 the milf are saying that there are elements that are outside their control and there are also some people and some sectors who say that this is just also a way for them to show how they feel about the current situation in the moa and the peace process we cannot make that determination as yet therefore we are looking at all of these and there will be a review but ultimately on the moa we will just have to wait for the ruling of the supreme court
5650604 if youre emotional about it why do you have to attack villages who do you have to kill people why do you have to destroy buildings why do you have to cut up some ears of some guys
5650605 we always conduct briefings through the department of foreign affairs with the diplomatic corps especially those involved heavily in mindanao we had one before when we had the north cotabato incident which was developing at the time
5650606 that is the biggest long term effect of the lanao incident because attacks like those in lanao reverberate to the whole world and investors are always shaken even by sensitivity of whether their money would be safe or not
5650607 i dont think those will be discussed this will be about the current mindanao situation in relation to all related matters that would be discussed on the issue
5650608 we just had this scheduled for friday how will this develop will depend on consensus that will be arrived at

5650638 i just really liked how john mccain gave well stated answers he didnt even have to think he takes a stand barack has a charming personality he didnt always give the direct answer
5650639 i think obama did very well and he doesnt need to win a majority of this audience he merely needs to keep mccains support below typical trends but this was mccains best performance in memory for the first time i can think of in 08 at least he comes across as the kind of guy a lot of conservatives can want to vote for rather than merely settle for
5650640 but i also think that its worth noting that but i suspect he may be riding high for a while after tonight
5650641 obama wasnt just bad but that mccain was very good
5650642 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared

5650692 we will be writing to sundowns to explain their behaviour in particular that of their team manager harris chueu
5650693 after receiving a report from sundowns team doctor relating to a supposed injury that the player is said to have picked up before the start of the game we then insisted on taking mphela for a second opinion
5650694 our doctor conducting the exercise declared mphela to be uninjured and therefore fit to travel i personally informed chueu about this and that the player will therefore travel on the same night august 18 to join the rest of the team in london
5650695 sometime after my conversation with chueu the sundowns manager then telephoned mphela not to board the aircraft and not to travel to london i made several calls to chueu thereafter and of course he never answered any of my calls or returned them
5650696 the player has therefore not travelled and we shall be contacting sundowns to explain their conduct and we will then take it from there

5650701 der technische und organisatorische anspruch eines eigenheims entspricht exakt dem eines kommerziellen wohnbaus der unterschied liegt nur im bauvolumen
5650702 die aufgabenstellung wird durch beh rdliche vorschreibungen technische innovationen oder kologische anspr che auch im eigenheimbau immer komplexer und die privaten auftraggeber investieren ein erhebliches finanzielles volumen
5650703 innovative architektur ist langlebig und kann ein hohes ma an flexibilit t f r ver nderungen schaffen das einfamilienhaus entwickelt sich vom traditionellen familien wohnsitz f r jahrhunderte zu einer immobilie mit wertsteigerungspotential
5650704 ein eigenheim wird in den meisten f llen nat rlich gebaut um selbst darin zu wohnen und stellt damit einen starken emotionalen wert dar wichtig ist aber auch der wiederverkaufswert der privaten immobilie
5650705 je genauer und besser die vorbereitung umso exakter kann der baupreis ermittelt werden
5650706 schon der boden bei der grundst ckswahl ist f r die h he der kosten entscheidend wer auf sand oder lehm baut kommt g nstiger davon als auf felsigem untergrund

5650789 i look forward to advising boris on an ongoing basis on transport
5650790 i have concluded however that it would not be appropriate for an unelected official to chair a body which is responsible for most of the money and a large part of the brief of an elected mayor
5650791 i also agree with the mayor that my position as adviser does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority or the title of first deputy mayor
5650792 transport for london is responsible for a huge range of transport policies that impinge directly on the lives of londoners and i was delighted when tim parker agreed to take charge of the board on my behalf
5650793 over the last few weeks however it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be taken are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge

5650799 ive been happy with the car on this rally this is the second event in a row where we have had virtually no problems and a clean run to the finish the reliability is at a good level now which means that we can begin to work more on the speed of the car
5650800 if you compare the amount of running our car has had with the other wrc cars we are making quite good progress this is probably the most difficult of all the asphalt rallies so to come away with a manufacturers point is a good result
5650801 im feeling reasonably optimistic for the other asphalt rounds in spain and corsica now today i really enjoyed myself
5650802 we had no problems today we just concentrated on taking it steady and getting to the finish the rally was a very valuable experience for both me and the team but i suffered a bit from inexperience
5650803 we had no problems at all this weekend which is very good the very positive thing is that things have improved through the rally
5650804 we started with okay speed and it got better through the rally
5650805 you have to remember weve only done two days testing with the car on tarmac so im really very happy with it
5650806 i think weve found the direction we need to get the maximum from the car so its good
5650807 there were large gaps today so we werent taking any silly risks
5650808 okay its not been a bad weekend and there are a lot of things we can take forward from it
5650809 this morning was a little frustrating but we tried to find out some new things today that will help us continue fine tuning the car and improve our performance which is the main focus
5650810 its been a steep learning curve but ive really enjoyed being back in the thick of the action again and i was very impressed with the whole creation team its a new car and a new track for me but i think i improved throughout the race and its been a fantastic and very worthwhile experience i have never raced with stephen before but hes a fantastic co driver and very helpful hes an easy guy to work with and very quick so im really looking forward to my two races in the us with him and the team

5650813 although it is a challenge we have faced many times before it is particularly tough this time as there are so many new elements coming into play for next season such as the return to slick tyres and the introduction of the kers system this makes the puzzle more complicated than ever which is why we have to operate as efficiently as possible in terms of time management commitment and energy as we are now in a delicate phase with no way to recover from any mistakes one step in the wrong direction could prove very costly

5650816 the worlds worst display of womens clothing is the womens olympics
5650817 no exposure of womens private parts on a global scale could make satan happier than olympic games that include womens sports
5650818 i understand most people are accustomed to not seeing a lot of clothing on the beach or in the water
5650819 we dont want to look like freaks or stick out like sore thumbs for being so covered up on the beach but i wanted to help make water activity accessible to muslim women
5650820 in my early teens i would sit on the street corners and play gospel songs people would listen applaud pat me on the head and tell me youll be good one day but they never tipped when i played a blues song though they always tipped always thats when i knew i wanted to play the blues

5650824 well ship something when its ready and when its something thats going to work on the platform
5650825 clearly there are a lot of hurdles weve been working for awhile plowing through the majority of them and weve got a lot of work still to do

5650846 well shit no wonder i barely had any friends in primary school
5650847 el problema es que la autodeterminaci n palestina en un estado separado es inviable tan inviable como el principio de separaci n entre una poblaci n rabe jud a demogr ficamente mezclada e irreversiblemente conectada en israel y los territorios ocupados por lo tanto no veo otro camino m s que comenzar a hablar sobre compartir la tierra que nos ha unido comparti ndola de una manera verdaderamente democr tica con igualdad de derechos para todos los ciudadanos
5650848 cada vez m s palestinos no tienen inter s en una soluci n negociada de dos estados porque quieren cambiar la esencia del conflicto de un paradigma argelino a uno sudafricano
5650849 se manifestar a internacionalmente como una violaci n de los derechos humanos de tal magnitud como para escandalizar radicalizar y desestabilizar a toda la regi n empeorando enormemente la seguridad de israel
5650850 la opci n de jordania tendr a que ser por consiguiente impuesta por israel a la fuerza y reproducir a el trauma de masas e implicaciones aterradoras para la seguridad regional generada por la
5650851 la opci n de un nico estado debe por tanto ponerse sobre la mesa debe encontrarse alguna manera de que tenga sentido la interdependencia israel palestina a trav s de consolidar la tierra como un nico estado democr tico que servir por igual a todos sus ciudadanos y en el que el hogar nacional jud o pueda encontrar una nueva y m s segura configuraci n sin tener que requerir nunca m s una mayor a jud a o un dominio tnico jud o sobre el estado
5650852 the problem is that palestinian self determination in a separate state is unworkable just as unworkable as the principle of separation between a demographically mixed irreversibly connected arab and jewish population in israel and the occupied territories i therefore see no other way than to begin now to speak about sharing the land that has thrust us together sharing it in a truly democratic way with equal rights for all citizens
5650853 more and more palestinians are uninterested in a negotiated two state solution because they want to change the essence of the conflict from an algerian paradigm to a south african one
5650854 would manifest internationally as a human rights violation of such magnitude as to scandalize radicalize and destabilize the entire region greatly worsening israels security
5650855 the jordan option would therefore have to be imposed by israel by force and this would reproduce the mass trauma and terrifying implications for regional security generated by
5650856 the one state option must therefore be brought to the table some way must be found to make sense of israeli palestinian interdependence by consolidating the land into one democratic state which will serve all its citizens equally and in which the jewish national home can find a new and more secure configuration no longer requiring a jewish majority or jewish ethnic dominion over the state
5650857 there are many many places where a homeland for the palestinians could in fact take place that would be consistent with their roots
5650858 but there is only one place on earth where the jewish people could have a homeland that is consistent with their roots
5650859 we have a moral obligation to the jewish people to honor the commitment that has been made through decades and decades of understanding that there is going to be a homeland for the jewish people
5650860 the question shouldnt be do arabs have a right to live in jewish territory
5650861 but do jews have a right to live in jewish territory
5650862 to say that jews cant live in jerusalem is the equivalent of telling the boston red sox they cant play in fenway park obviously that would never go over very well on beacon hill
5650863 we propose a broader vision of language learning which encompasses the interests of community and foreign language learners breaking down artificial distinctions between the two areas and benefiting all learners whatever their background and whatever their goals
5650864 our recommendations specifically concern improving provision for community language learning in higher education but should also contribute to the development and embedding of this wider vision the researchers said

5650868 whatever youre expecting put it to one side there are a million and one female singer songwriters out there and most of them are lovely but then there are some that are trying to break out of that mould or were never in it thats where clara kousah comes in
5650869 this is a record of depths with a real flavour of melancholy that whilst surprising really works with kousahs soft vocals at once this is both sad and strangely comforting the songs here are stripped back the spaces as important as the music that rushes to fill them

5650888 tom blumer at bizzyblog brings actual facts about coal miner fatalities to light and gives the bdsers a reality check
5650889 the best blogger in the state and a more talented natural economist than any of those pointy headed keynesian halfwits
5650890 tom blumer is doing stuff that msnbc and ap should have done before providing the teenager farris hassan a national international forum and 15 minutes of fame
5650891 guys like tom blumer cover what really matters and theyre independent enough to tell the truth without fear of aggravating corporate media owners
5650892 bizzyblog made my point with numbers and facts and stuff
5650893 this is why i read bizzy blog he catches the stuff that i manage to miss
5650894 the numbers are good they are respectable i think they are good because we were coming off a low base and now we are back on the growth trend
5650895 i think the market will be surprised most analysts were forecasting the mid threes for the year and we may well see closer to four percent
5650896 the economy is more resilient than we thought it to be but there are constraints such as skills capacity and power supply issues which is an ongoing threat and a drag on the gdp growth

5650909 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5650910 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5650911 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5650912 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5650913 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5650914 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5650915 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5650916 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers

5650926 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5650927 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5650928 the significance of this concept lies in the fact that the massive installed base of parking lots and roadways creates a low cost solar collector an order of magnitude more productive than traditional solar cells the significantly high surface area can offset the expected lower efficiency compared to traditional solar cells by several orders of magnitude and hence result in significantly lower cost per unit of power produced

5650931 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5650932 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5650933 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5650934 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5650935 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5650936 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5650937 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5650938 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5650939 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5650940 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5650941 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5650942 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5650943 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5650944 i know how you work and i really want to find someone like you passionate with technical stuffs
5650945 trappin all mornin trappin all mornin the dollars are comin in so wavely
5650946 it may be biased to view the deal as going against nuclear non proliferation efforts
5650947 for example the issue of global warming has been getting serious in recent years and co2 emissions from emerging nations such as china and india are becoming a problem
5650948 it is important that india proceeds with nuclear power generation as clean energy
5650949 we are immensely pleased to have two experienced and distinguished individuals of the caliber of kevin yessian and linda byus join our company
5650950 with the signing of two new five year agreements in the united arab emirates and the quickening pace of research and development of our non proliferative fuel designs it is important that we bring onboard stellar professionals to carry our ambitious but carefully developed timelines forward kevin and linda are well known and greatly respected practitioners in the nuclear and energy fields they are welcome additions to our team

5650955 its all about the call its all about the call and being obedient to follow the holy spirit wherever he chooses to lead me
5650956 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5650957 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5650958 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5650959 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5650960 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5650961 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5650962 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5650963 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5650964 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5650965 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5650966 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5650967 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5650968 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5650969 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5650970 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5650971 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5650972 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5650973 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5650974 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5650975 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5650976 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5650977 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5650978 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5650979 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5650980 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5650981 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5650982 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5650983 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5650984 wat is belangrijker een lekker broodje of een charismatische spreker
5650985 waar wind jij je in vredesnaam zo over op maran zo vroeg op in de morgen
5650986 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5650987 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5650988 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5650989 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes

5650994 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5650995 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5650996 this is a planning took where all things are going
5650997 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5650998 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5650999 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5651000 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5651001 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5651002 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5651003 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5651004 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5651005 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5651006 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5651007 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5651008 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5651009 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5651010 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5651011 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5651012 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5651013 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5651014 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5651015 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5651016 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5651017 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5651018 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city

5651147 ninety per cent of the work is convincing people that the eyes are real
5651148 the subtlety of the timing of eye movements is a big one people also have a natural asymmetry for instance in the muscles in the side of their face those types of imperfections arent that significant but they are what makes people look real
5651149 theres always been control systems for different facial movements but say in the past you had a dial for controlling whether an eye was open or closed and in one frame you set the eye at 3 4 open the next 1 2 open etc this is like achieving that degree of control with much finer movements
5651150 for instance you could be controlling the movement in the top 3 4mm of the right side of the smile

5651157 i think the political leaders have no excuse now they have to address the immediate issues like inflation and the long term structural problems of pakistani polity they cant use musharraf as an excuse any more
5651158 it is a change about the democratic spirit and transition and the establishment of constitutionality
5651159 it is now really a test of their ability and a test of their capacity to deliver

5651194 auf die ganze mannschaft und auf den verein nat rlich auch auf j rgen klopp ich habe in mainz eine gute zeit mit ihm gehabt und ich glaube dass ich f r ihn auch in dortmund gut spielen werde
5651195 wir freuen uns dass der wechsel geklappt hat er hat sowohl in der bundesliga als auch in der nationalmannschaft seine klasse unter beweis gestellt
5651196 mit mladen kommt ein spieler zu uns der in der offensive variabel einsetzbar und zudem sehr torgef hrlich ist wir sind davon berzeugt dass er die qualit t der mannschaft steigern wird

5651200 but this is just our estimate we dont know and even if microsoft and sony told us i couldnt say because it would be under nda

5651202 imagine if we stamped out the last vestige of the politically correct nonsense that for so long dominated the educational establishment and militated against competitive sport and its indispensable concepts of winning and losing
5651203 there are so many more important issues in the world today than palestine that i wonder why i am so obsessed with it
5651204 well of course what i am obsessed with is israel and its a personal obsession relating to the catastrophe that befell my people in a way that no catastrophe had previously befallen any other people
5651205 so let me say outright that what wrongs the israelis may have done to the palestinians are in the contexts of history and of our time actually
5651206 for them every loss an olive tree an orchard an uninhabited hill is a challenge to the divine order of things in that sense the world of muslim arabs is unchangeable and untouchable including palestine
5651207 how do i say this the palestinian national movement is a fraud you can judge the reality of palestine by the travels of its leaders yasser arafat went everywhere
5651208 how could yemen be so important divided by tribes upon tribes nearly half of its population is under 15 and one of its primary products is qat chewed into oblivion it is nearly equally split between shia and sunni one of its last legislative reforms was to eliminate the age qualification of 15 for girls to marry
5651209 after all there must be many men women and children too who want an ordinary life it is not just israel that denies it to them by checkpoints and other humiliating routines it is the very perfervid character of palestinian society that substitutes fantasy for the commonplace
5651210 khalil hanuns 35 year legal fight to prevent a jewish settler group from taking possession of his home in disputed east jerusalem will enter a critical phase this week when an israeli court decides whether to keep him in jail for disobeying orders to vacate his property
5651211 were granted possession of the home in 1956 by the united nations relief amp works agency
5651212 its amazing and im not sure ive wrapped my mind around it yet
5651213 you put the wind he had in new york behind the 9 69 here and o k now we could be down in the 9 5s except that he shut down with 20 meters to go
5651214 so now im like o k is that in the 9 4s its mind boggling
5651215 it takes a while when youre that tall to actually get into the groove when youre coming from sitting down basically
5651216 i actually thought after 30 meters that asafa powell or even walter dix would be leading but they werent i called it all week whats going to end up happening if he jumps on them before 30 meters good night
5651217 an excellent start for him next to guys six seven eight inches shorter is not going to look great on tape
5651218 hes 21 years old and been really running 100 meters for four months
5651219 his neck is arched coming out of the blocks like this
5651220 i dont know how its possible to get faster in his middle 40 but hes going to
5651221 a big wheel is going to turn over slower than a small wheel and it used to be thought that was a disadvantage except now when you see this guy who has the turnover of somebody six feet
5651222 add that to the fact that hes probably covering three or four more inches with every stride and that hes only taking 40 to 41 strides to finish a 100 and you cannot argue with the math
5651223 all of a sprints velocity is created from point of touchdown until the foot is directly below the body
5651224 bolts long stride means that he is creating velocity for a longer period than shorter runners
5651225 we dont get style points and thats whats good about the 100 meters but he absolutely will get technically sounder
5651226 hell get tighter like maybe carl lewis systematically down the track
5651227 we have a 6 foot 5 inch guy thats running 9 6s and beating the rest of the olympic field by two tenths of a second hes our new technology

5651231 die ums tze im fondshandel sind in der vergangenen woche erneut zur ckgegangen so dass sich aktuell nur noch diejenigen anleger im markt tummeln die immer aktiv sind eine art grundrauschen
5651232 in russland hat die beruhigung des georgien konfliktes f r eine ralley gesorgt vor allem bei den russischen aktien ganz mutige anleger die hier versucht haben mit limits auf der kaufseite zu arbeiten sind in den vergangenen tagen belohnt worden
5651233 im gesamten geldmarktsektor sind angebot und nachfrage in dieser woche ausgeglichen hier ist keine fluchtneigung zu erkennen die anleger f hlen sich scheinbar ganz wohl und bleiben in den produkten
5651234 es muss erst wieder vertrauen und ein bisschen mehr begeisterung in die m rkte kommen damit themenfonds wieder eine chance haben solange anleger nicht wissen was sie machen sollen greifen sie bestenfalls zum altbew hrten und wagen nicht den schritt zu etwas spezielleren produkten
5651235 wir gehen trotz der schw cheren konjunkturellen situation weiterhin davon aus unsere umsatz und ertragsziele im operativen gesch ft zu erreichen und f r das gesamte gesch ftsjahr 2008 ein umsatzwachstum von 5 bis 10 prozent bei berproportional steigenden ertr gen zu erwirtschaften eine abweichung ist nur bei einer sehr deutlichen eintr bung der konsumnachfrage zu erwarten
5651236 there are always consequences in what you do if you think that attacking them would be positive what do you gain it is the second biggest economy in the world and in 50 years it will be the biggest economy suddenly you break the bridge it would be so easy to be there at the olympics

5651239 theres no lying theres no cheating theres no nothing jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think i have ever met people are different people have different chemistry i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
5651240 jennifer will never kiss and tell but its she who ended the relationship johns childish behaviour only confirms she was right to dump him now hes acting like a spoiled child expect jennifer to behave like a lady
5651241 jennifer was tired of paying for everything cobwebs come flying out of johns wallet when he opens it john liked living like a movie star when he was with her jennifer would never say anything but you could tell it irritated her

5651252 we can expect high temperatures this weekend which should not present us with any problems after the high downforce configuration we ran at the last race in budapest we now return to a medium to low downforce configuration with some updates to the package that were already tested at jerez in the week prior to the hungarian grand prix

5651258 i am happy to hear that i have broken it the best time but i can definitely go faster than that
5651259 the 500 is always going to be a tough one and a lot closer than the 1 000
5651260 to come away from this with two medals and one of them gold would constitute a good olympics for me the gb team have done incredibly well and now its my turn to try and add to that
5651261 now we will prepare for that for four years it wont be easy were going to have to work hard for it but thats the main event we are all thinking of
5651262 i think were just better at lifting than other sports
5651263 the pacific people are short but built very strong we think that weightlifting is the only sport that can take us up
5651264 the chinese girl is great in light wind and she is physically stronger than i am
5651265 so i just have to go and try my best

5651271 its great to see china back near the top of the basketball tree
5651272 it got very sophisticated because obviously the battery doesnt last long and then we had to look at circuits and interrupters so we have been working on it around two months with a crack team
5651273 i have a lot of friends on the australian team
5651274 they are playing us and i dont care about them at all i just want to beat them
5651275 its great to see china back near the top of the basketball tree
5651276 this means so much to him gold medals are the american dream
5651277 there is little risk of the economy falling into a major downturn

5651279 we need to be mindful of both upside and downside risks

5651289 the feeling in the intelligence community was that this was a very high risk endeavor

5651294 i dont want to take any money from the rich
5651295 a sense of balance and fairness in our tax code
5651296 it is time for folks like me who make more than 250 000 to pay our fair share
5651297 w e will save social security for future generations by asking the wealthiest americans to pay their fair share
5651298 the first part of my plan is to tax the windfall profits of oil companies and use some of that money to help you pay the rising price of gas
5651299 well charlie what ive said is that i would look at raising the capital gains tax for purposes of fairness

5651302 saakashvilis petulant move has only served to highlight the failures of current us foreign policy and the continued petulance of washington can no longer be seen as a viable path either for europe or the united states
5651303 it appears this was well thought out and planned in advance and suggests a level of coordination in the russian government between the military and the other civilian agencies and departments that we are striving for today
5651304 the russian military is back they are to be contended with
5651305 which is that tenants have very few rights in china and that they have been forcibly evicted on an extremely large scale without adequate compensation or avenues for redress
5651306 what is heartening on that question is that both candidates republican and democrat have indicated that they will be moving on this and with an ambitious set of targets he said

5651310 i think our officials are working very closely on this to make sure there are no barriers towards linking these schemes and based on my advice there are none mr rudd told the conference
5651311 what is heartening on that question is that both candidates republican and democrat have indicated that they will be moving on this and with an ambitious set of targets he said news com au is not responsible for the content of external sites our women too timid at work
5651312 i think it is absolutely regrettable that the leader of fiji has decided not to attend this forum rudd said today in auckland
5651313 it would have been far better for the leader of fiji to sit down with the leaders of the pacific island countries and answer to the commitments which have been previously given by fiji to fellow island states that is now not going to occur
5651314 we dont believe we can sit idly by while the principles of democracy are shredded and therefore the resolve of pacific island counties is to act in concert on this question he said
5651315 in our consultations with our fellow heads of government from the pacific island countries we are confronted front and centre with the impact of climate change on regional states rudd said
5651316 i pray the government stops this downsliding and takes the country out of this crisis

5651344 reducing the psychosocial impact of acne is considered one of the guiding principles for its clinical management and it is important to measure and evaluate this impact
5651345 knowledge of these patient preferences may help dermatologists balance clinical trial results with patients expectations of therapy
5651346 randomized blinded placebo controlled trials have shown that three to four months of conventional acne therapy including topical benzoyl peroxide topical retinoids and oral antibiotics typically produces reductions in lesion counts in the 40 percent to 60 percent range
5651347 it has also been suggested that the incidence of scarring from facial acne approaches 95 percent
5651348 thus adolescents marked preference for total clearance over partial 50 percent clearance or clearance with scarring suggests that physicians must weigh high patient expectations against these clinical data regarding efficacy and risk of sequelae
5651349 dermatologists are keenly aware of the ways skin diseases may have a substantial impact on a patients overall quality of life
5651350 however in an environment in which health expenditures are allocated by non physicians it is critical to demonstrate the burden of skin disease relative to non dermatologic disease to funding sources government agencies and the lay public
5651351 in terms of social value preference weighted questionnaires are instrumental in evaluating the extent to which increased health care expenditures lead to patient benefits because they incorporate a summary description of health status social values and life expectancy
5651352 fundamentally utilities measure true patient preferences uninhibited by physician assumptions such measurement refocuses physicians on the primary goal of our profession improving the care of our patients
5651353 our goal is to work with kansas businesses to comply with the law while aggressively enforcing our consumer protection laws
5651354 when businesses dont follow the rules we aggressively pursue relief for consumers
5651355 most businesses do a great job complying with laws designed to protect consumers
5651356 but the few that violate the law harm kansas consumers as well as law abiding kansas businesses
5651357 a neurons excitability whether it will fire hinges on this delicate equilibrium
5651358 finding statistically robust associations linked to two proteins that may be involved in regulating such ion channels and that are also thought to be targets of drugs used to clinically to treat bipolar disorder is astonishing
5651359 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results
5651360 improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder
5651361 since creating kansas mentors with coach snyder over two years ago employees have expressed a significant interest in helping with the program
5651362 this creates an opportunity for employees to volunteer as a mentor and make a difference in the lives of children
5651363 those of us with kansas mentors are truly grateful for governor sebelius loyal and caring support
5651364 this will enhance the number of mentors and volunteers throughout our state
5651365 one of the challenges that our states mentoring organizations face is the recruitment of caring quality mentors
5651366 by allowing state employees the opportunity to receive time away from work to mentor we are providing these organizations with an invaluable resource to better serve our youth
5651367 to challenge and nonviolently resist our countrys continuing war in and occupation of iraq
5651368 our journey began in the city of chicago site of the 1968 democratic party convention in the midst of the vietnam war the walk will conclude on august 30 in st paul in time for the start of the 2008 republican party convention in the midst of the iraq war
5651369 in our previous actions wed tried to meet more with political leaders this time weve decided to meet more with average people theyre obviously concerned about the war in iraq but theres not much confidence that either mccain or obama will bring that war to an end
5651370 our walk demonstrates a direct way to travel toward our goal of a peaceful society the core of any contemporary movement to resist war and military empire building must be a radical change in the way each of us and all of us use energy and other limited resources of our common planet
5651371 dispatches from the religious left the future of faith and politics in america
5651372 the fiercely partisan religious right leader rick warren of four years ago is little different from the rick warren of today
5651373 at the civic forum warren featured the key litmus tests of the religious right abortion and same sex marriage while ignoring the so called broader agenda of the supposedly newly moderate evangelicals such as climate change and domestic and world poverty
5651374 innocent customers should not be dragged into federal litigation just because they bought a product that other less scrupulous purchasers may be hacking for unlawful purposes
5651375 the court should recognize the privacy interests of these customers especially since echostar does not need these customer lists in order to have its day in court against freetech

5651379 the image of public leadership is not the image of a 20 year old
5651380 it is an image of a white man of middle age
5651381 the process is better served with a broad range of perspectives
5651382 it is that they are not mature enough nor have had life experience to guide them through difficult issues and decisions i have seen some of these people in action and i can see that they are very smart but lacking in the decision making process
5651383 you want people to move up through politics and learn

5651412 uang lebih sering datang dan dalam jumlah yang tidak terbatas dengan uang sagalanya bisa didapatkan fasilitas kesejahteraan perlindungan kesenangan dan segala macam kemudahan termasuk cinta
5651413 tapi uang yang sekarang dikeluarkan oleh edy sejuta lebih banyak dari ketika ia masih hidup pas pasan pendapatannya memang seringkali bisa 20 juta kali pendapatan sebelumnya namun dengan begitu banyak urusan yang harus diselesaikannya sekarang apakah ia masih memiliki waktu untuk menikmati segala kemajuan yang diperolehnya itu bayangkan ada 10 rumah tapi hampir tidak pernah ditempati karena dia selalu melakukan perjalanan dari hotel ke hotel yang menikmati justru sopir dan para pembantu istri cantik dan terkenal tapi satu minggu belum tentu bisa bersama sama sebab keduanya punya jadwal ketat apakah sebuah kemajuan berarti minus kebahagiaan
5651414 itu matematika kuno jawabannya juga sangat ketinggalan bukan begitu caranya bertanya sekarang bukan begitu caranya membuat ukuran sekarang bukan begitu caranya berbahagia sekarang dan bukan bahagia yang sekarang dikejar sebagai sasaran utama
5651415 ukurannya adalah rata rata orang lain aku tidak mau menjadi orang rata rata apa artinya kebahagiaan kalau kita sama saja dengan orang lain aku ingin di atas aku baru merasasenang puas kalau sudah paling atas itu berarti kita berarti apa itu kebahagiaan atau bukan tai kucing yang konkrit saja nomor satu dan paling depan
5651416 apa sebenarnya tujuan anda semua memilih saya untuk diajak membuat komunitas budaya
5651417 karena bapak orang yang sukses bahkan sangat sukses kalau bapak bisa membantu kami kami yakin mereka yang sukses sukses akan mengikuti selama ini kesuksesan seperti dipisahkan dari komunitas budaya seakan akan orang yang sukses adalah mereka yang memasang jarak dengan aktivitas budaya karena itu bapak menjadi sangat strategis untuk memulai budaya baru yakni ikut membangun budaya kita yang dari segala aspeknya sedang mengalami kemerosotan ini sebuah investasi yang memang tidak bisa dinilai dengan angka sebab keuntungannya tidak kelihatan namun justru apabila berhasil akan membawa kita kepada tata nilai yang baru yang memperjelas apa sebenarnya sukses itu apa sebenarnya nomor satu itu apa sebenarnya menang itu dan pada akhirnya apa sebenarnya bahagia itu
5651418 wah jangan memakai kata kata itu pak edy sebab konotasinya dengan revolusi kebudyaan di china yang penuh darah ini bukan revolusi pak ini hanya kebangkitan yang membuat mereka yang mampu untuk memalingkan perhatiannya untuk membangun negeri dengan cara lain bukan dengan gedung mobil tetapi dengan buah budi dengan budaya kita sedang mengalami kemerosotan budaya karena itu kita memerlukan komunitas komunitas yang mencegah erosi dan abrasi itu berjalan dengan drastis minimal kita tidak akan runtuh dengan cara yang begitu konyol
5651419 saya ketawa sebab saudara mengartikan pembangunan phisik itu sebagai kehancuran budaya kenapa saudara membenci kemewahan tunggu jangan dijawab dulu saya belum selesai orang bilang mobil satu itu cukup saya bilang keliru mobil sepuluh juga belum cukup sebab ada seratus urusan yang memerlukan 200 mobil yang bisa saling menggantikian satu sama lain kalau ada yang macat jadi segala kemajuan phisik yang anda anggap kemajuan ini nampak berkelebihan karena saudara saudara mengukurnya dari gunung dari dusun dari gubuk gubuk kumuh di pinggir sungai baru kalau anda bisa mengukur dari paris london new yotk tokyo anda akan setuju dengan saya bahwa kita masih primitif meskipun sudah bangun jangan layang mono rel dan punya bus way kita masih kurang kerangsukan membangun gedung tinggi kita belum cukup tinggi kita harus bekerja lebih keras untuk mengumpulkan duit dan jangan membelanjakan duit untuk menahan pembangunan terus terang saya tidak tertarik komunita budaya anda membuat orang berhenti bekerja berhenti berambisi padahal kerja yang kita perlukan sekatang maaf selamat siang
5651420 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5651421 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5651422 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5651423 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5651424 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

5651451 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5651452 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5651453 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5651454 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5651455 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5651456 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5651457 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5651458 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5651459 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5651460 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5651461 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5651462 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5651463 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5651464 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5651465 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5651466 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5651467 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5651468 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5651469 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5651470 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5651471 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5651472 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5651473 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5651474 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5651475 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5651476 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5651477 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5651478 who are open to doing something on the production side
5651479 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5651480 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5651481 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5651482 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5651483 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5651484 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5651485 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5651486 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5651487 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5651488 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

5651512 ok im white but i dont hate black people i love black people anyway is it alright for me to feel like a victim even though i havent been enslaved part of my family are jewish
5651513 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5651514 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5651515 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5651516 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5651517 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5651518 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5651519 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5651520 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5651521 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5651522 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5651523 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5651524 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5651525 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5651526 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5651527 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5651528 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5651529 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5651530 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

5651532 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5651533 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5651534 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5651535 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5651536 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5651537 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

5651550 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5651551 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5651552 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5651553 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5651554 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

5651560 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5651561 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5651562 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

5651571 fuel raises the bar in terms of scale and exhilaration for racing games
5651572 we begin with the largest racing environment to appear in gaming ever with our accelerated effects of climate change and dynamic weather system we add an extra dimension that change races on the fly and constantly presents new challenges to players

5651574 i dont know how old she is but i do know that she gave a performance that merited her medal
5651575 obviously im gutted but last sunday i didnt think id even be competing because of a rib injury so im pleased just to make the final
5651576 the dismount probably did cost me my place on the podium
5651577 my dismount is normally not a problem but i just didnt get enough height and to be honest i thought i was going to end up on my face

5651581 she told me in the middle of the night that she will be home shortly
5651582 she should be here within the next couple of weeks
5651583 i think were all on a high shes over the moon
5651584 the neighbours have been sitting at their tvs all weekend its something else
5651585 i think shes done brilliantly especially as she only turned professional about three years ago and shes reached olympic level
5651586 she played hockey at school and she started off with horseriding before she went to university in dundee then she went to running and did the london marathon she got quite a few medals in running
5651587 ian is a cyclist but not a professional she was soon beating him up hills
5651588 she said she was going in to give it her best and see how she did
5651589 i think she did awfully well and im so proud of her its brilliant its just brilliant
5651590 i had massive high hopes and i know what i can jump
5651591 i was expecting a medal and ive probably just lost my best ever chance of getting an olympic medal i could feel the pressure a lot and i thought i could deal with it its a wasted opportunity
5651592 it is a massive disappointment if someone had pulled out a massive jump then at least i could say he jumped far but people werent exactly jumping well out there i dont know why
5651593 qualification went well it felt easy and i thought i am going to go out here and get myself a medal all day i was thinking about was the possibility of being the first british athletics medal at this olympics and i knew i was capable of doing it i will be angry more than anything when i look back
5651594 we have been working closely with the company over the past 18 months on lean manufacturing and have made 3m in savings at the monkstown plant
5651595 now is the time our members are paid back for all their efforts unite members will be staging a half day strike each monday from now on the last time a dispute occurred at the telecoms manufacturing plant was 16 years ago
5651596 i have been itching to get racing ive been here since the day before the opening ceremony and been watching people win medals every day it is quite an inspiring thing
5651597 it shows the boa british olympic association are doing an excellent job looking after us uk sport and the lottery funding has made a big difference and is starting to show now with us bringing home the medals hopefully we will have another successful week
5651598 it was comfortable rather than easy some people said it looked easy but it is never easy in an olympic games when you have other world class athletes there
5651599 it went exactly to plan i knew i was strong enough to win that heat with the idea of going straight to the final that is a big advantage because tomorrow ive got the 500m heats and it will give me a day of rest before the 500m semi which is going to be hard on thursday
5651600 the plan was to get a good start settle into a solid pace throughout the rest of the race and then respond to what other people were doing around me theres no point trying to win by 10 lengths just at the moment
5651601 becky is still in beijing after the most incredible week of her life weve got to remember that shes only 19 of course there will be a lot of sponsors queuing up but her priority is family time and rest

5651604 its the only way to find out whats really going on
5651605 hopefully the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill
5651606 in some respects the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most potential energy so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion the most interest i dont mean for the audience i mean for us
5651607 would be very unpleasant for most people to watch its really a gathering of curmudgeons expressing frustration and upset and the rest of the day is spent trying to repress that through whatever creative devices we can find
5651608 they have used fringe scientists and fake experts to muddy scientific debates on global warming stem cell research evolution and other matters
5651609 yes and no of course i didnt like it but i expected him to do it and i probably would have done something similar but yes i am very very very disappointed
5651610 i picked rasmus because he was the only one who could beat me
5651611 not really thats what sports about you have to do what you have to do
5651612 its been a long four years of waiting but its finally over i couldnt be smiling any harder there was a job to be done and i went out there and delivered
5651613 its hard enough to defend on a windsurfer as it is
5651614 ive just got to sail my own race so its really a case of keeping it tight
5651615 ive given myself a great chance going into the medal race theres no reason with the momentum ive got now that i cant give it my best shot its the other girls the chinese jian yin and the italian 2000 gold medallist alessandra sensini who are looking over their shoulders
5651616 i had a rough time in the middle of the regatta and i had to pick myself up from that
5651617 it was a bit of an anti climax how it happened but im not going to complain about that
5651618 i didnt really know what had happened when the fight was stopped i just said thank god he had been a thorn in my side in the past and i was determined it wasnt going to happen again
5651619 cammarelle took me off the road to athens but i wasnt mature then im mature now maybe not fully mature but enough to do this job
5651620 i saw the medals tally up on a notice board at the gb headquarters and it made me even more determined to add to it the trouble comes in your mind when you think about what it means to you and the people around you
5651621 he is my idol and i want to be as much like him as i can
5651622 is that im not facing an olympic semi final its just another semi final in some routine championship

5651632 our inflation figures are way above that we really need to change the way we do business
5651633 it may be related to the government expenditure around the elections although i dont have the details
5651634 when youre going into a hyper inflation cycle until such a time as the authorities take appropriate steps to counter it it seems to continue to spiral out of control
5651635 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5651636 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks

5651639 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime theyre great buys sovereign wealth funds come in and make a lot of money by buying them
5651640 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink

5651670 our rules governing politics also must be kept up to date
5651671 our old rules are way way out of date it means we have to change to new rules liberalize to allow people to participate more actively and flexibly
5651672 if you make a political commercial so that its purely made up material partisan stuff footage distorted to create a slanted impression i think those should still be off limits
5651673 we have to move away from this total ban and find ways to allow people to let off steam a little bit more
5651674 we still dont allow this and our concern is law and order and security and it comes back to race and religion again because one incident could undermine our racial harmony
5651675 we will manage it with a light touch theres no need for the police to get involved
5651676 the overall thrust of all these changes is to liberalize our society to widen the space for expression and participation we encourage more citizens to engage in debate to participate in building our shared future and we will progressively open up our system even more
5651677 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves

5651688 we hebben de afgelopen maanden nauw samengewerkt met neversoft activision harmonix en komani om ervoor te zorgen dat de gitaren en drums die zij voor de playstation 3 maken op een gestandaardiseerde manier werken

5651693 biden is arguably the most effective voice democrats have on foreign policy and heres why joe biden is an incredibly arrogant jerk and thats exactly what democrats need in the 2008 election he was the only democrat who really figured out how to talk about republicans and foreign policy all the other candidates on the stage started from the presumption that republicans were strong on national security and voters needed to be convinced of their failures and then led to a place of support for a democratic alternative biden dispensed with all that he started from the position that republicans had been catastrophic failures on foreign policy and their ongoing claims to competence and leadership should be laughed at and even mocked
5651694 if this guy were a republican democrats would be hanging him out to dry all he needs is a confederate flag to complete the picture were talking major macaca moment potential here and yes as hilarious for george allen as that was is obama ready to sign up a vp with a record of racism comments including one aimed straight at himself during the primaries i doubt it

5651730 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
5651731 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
5651732 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

5651831 indeed the drama of the sedan is amplified in the cts sport wagon as the centerline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle
5651832 the more you study the rear of the cts sport wagon the more you see
5651833 functionality was certainly a guiding factor during development but so was the idea to inject emotion into the normally sedate wagon category
5651834 theyre not fins in the classic sense but they work to help disguise the cargo load system and yes they acknowledge cadillacs design heritage

5651837 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

5651844 bob clegg agrees with paul hodes on earmarks on opposing a border fence and on increasing health care mandates bosse said
5651845 how can he make the case against paul hodes in november
5651846 this is a real step backwards for him clegg said of bosse
5651847 i am disappointed he says i am with paul hodes he knows that is not the case and he is better than that

5651866 the fbi has completely shut congress out of its investigation into anthrax attacks on capitol hill and around the nation
5651867 scientists in and out of government say the rush to destroy the spores may have eliminated crucial evidence about the anthrax in the letters sent to congress and the media
5651868 this was an astonishing thing to do it should have been preserved as evidence this was a roadmap of everybody and anybody that had gotten access to develop the super strain that hit leahy and daschle
5651869 fbi scientists early on had but destroyed the unique strain of anthrax used in the deadly 2001 attacks that years later would lead them to dr bruce ivins this was anthrax that ivins took from his army lab in february 2002 and gave investigators

5651894 the us was thinking of flying u2 reconnaissance aircraft with fighter cover over iraq painted in un colors if saddam fired on them he would be in breach
5651895 it was also possible that a defector could be brought out who would give a public presentation about saddams wmd and there was also a small possibility that saddam would be assassinated
5651896 but they rarely matter in terms of winning a state or region as mike dukakis and john kerry found out and a weak candidate doesnt really drag the ticket into the drink as george h w bush found out

5652054 we need more rational discussion about nuclear power in australia and much less of the emotive political debate weve had in the last few years
5652055 we cannot envisage any circumstance under which australia will have a nuclear power industry he said then

5652063 saya ngebathin sambil membayar ongkos yang diminta kenek nah waktu bayar ongkos ini saya baru perhatikan bahwa didepan saya penumpangnya seorang pria bule
5652064 bule aja ngerokok diluar ini supir malah ngerokok di bis
5652065 dengan tergesa karena diburu buru kenek yang tak sabaran tapi setidaknya pesan saya sampai kepadanya karena saya sempat melihat pria bule itu mengedipkan mata tanda dia mendengar dan menanggapinya
5652066 es cierto que la empresa mon meros filial de pdvsa en colombia decidi apoyar el proceso de acuerdo humanitario en una cuant a cuyo monto no estoy en condiciones de precisar
5652067 ten a la estricta finalidad de respaldar la realizaci n de eventos culturales y de opini n p blica en solidaridad con el acuerdo humanitario pues el gobierno colombiano no ofreci ning n apoyo efectivo para ese costoso y complejo proceso

5652079 las farc han mostrado continuamente una clara indiferencia hacia la vida de los civiles manifest y hacia el cumplimiento del derecho humanitario y los derechos humanos
5652080 la defensor a del pueblo de colombia hab a advertido con anterioridad mediante su sistema de alerta temprana que los civiles de ituango corr an peligro por las actividades de las farc y de los narcotraficantes en la regi n

5652088 with insurers loss rations running in excess of 130 on recent years we are predicting a severe increase in premium rates and an inability to negotiate long term trade credit insurance arrangements
5652089 as a result this is a very busy point in the uk construction insurance cycle and underwriters with a commitment to construction are now at a premium
5652090 the station is on for 24 hours but my three hours were the only revenue producing hours
5652091 they do accident reconstructions all the time and they were great out there
5652092 the really sad part of this whole thing is that the front license plate from the honda was left at the scene and we were able to get the information we needed from it
5652093 one thing pete rose did that he said made a difference was hustle and thats one thing i hope i instill in you during camp
5652094 its been pretty fun so far and im hoping the camp will help me with pitching
5652095 i love running and doing the drills with the team
5652096 he played for three or four years and quit but he missed it so he got back into it
5652097 its great that they offer a program where they can get professional training
5652098 he also seems to really like what he is doing
5652099 hes getting the parents involved and as an educator that is refreshing to see
5652100 hes a big fan and wants to play for the reds
5652101 we wanted to do something really different with the house of the dead overkill
5652102 with sega weve been able to create a fresh look for the franchise i think youll agree its like nothing youve seen before on wii
5652103 paying homage to the pulp horror comics and films that inspired generations of gore fans the house of the dead overkill will expose gamers to a brand new fleshy rollercoaster ride of revolting dismemberment
5652104 this is the hardcore wii title youve been waiting for
5652105 i havent changed my mind i want to join everton
5652106 el mejor m dico en cirug a est tica del mundo
5652107 i am there a long time i thought last year coming in was probably my last year
5652108 in the last couple of years i thought that it was slipping away
5652109 but i think that this team has answered a lot of questions anything that was thrown at us against tipp we had the answers
5652110 i am happy to be in an all ireland final now we are just so pleased
5652111 we have always wanted to give our fans a day out in an all ireland final and it was more for them really than the players for the whole of waterford really
5652112 we may have clicked against tipp but we mustnt forget that we are up against an awesome team in kilkenny and their manager brian cody
5652113 kilkenny were without a game for five weeks and they came up and cork stayed with them for 20 minutes and there was just pure class all over the field they had no excuses
5652114 they are going to be a hard team to beat but please god we will turn up on the day and it will be a good final
5652115 ferrari has the ability and resources to work on next years car without having to relax for one moment on continuing the development of the f2008 in a championship that is proving to be very tight between ourselves and our usual opponents
5652116 we are now in a delicate phase of the season with no way to recover from any mistakes one step in the wrong direction could prove very costly
5652117 at the risk of repeating ourselves our aim is the same as ever to ensure that every element of our package and team works to its maximum as we strive to bring home as many points as possible and hopefully be the first to put our names on a valencia trophy
5652118 the track looks very interesting combining a variety of different corner types as well as some sections with a high top speed maybe slightly lower than those seen at the montreal circuit in canada
5652119 we can expect high temperatures this weekend which should not present us with any problems
5652120 im through to the semis and thats the main thing for now the next paddle on thursday will be the big one
5652121 i just wanted to get a gauge of where i was at i was pretty nervous but i always get nervous before i race
5652122 i think i handled it all right im not too down cast i know i can do better in the semis

5652131 211 will offer information on a broad range of services its a great companion to 911 by not tying up emergency lines for non emergency situations
5652132 were hoping to go live january of 09 maybe even before that
5652133 nearly 65 percent of ohio is covered by 211 the under served areas are mainly southeast and northwest ohio were hoping to remedy the situation by bringing the service here
5652134 i can see the benefit to it for our county and the other counties
5652135 as far as emergency services we need to work really close with them on how it operates im behind it and support it
5652136 its exactly the same product and we wanted to do that so the pavers would be interchangeable
5652137 deputy lantz was extremely helpful and i appreciate his kindness and concern
5652138 saved the life of a young man that didnt value his life
5652139 above and beyond his duty to help victims of domestic violence
5652140 he turned a dangerous situation into a safe situation for both the victim and the deputies
5652141 if the sheriff deems the conduct to be serious enough he can basically bypass the basic discipline steps and go straight to suspension or termination
5652142 we want to confirm findings and recreate them and maybe find out what kind of hauntings there are wed like to find out more about whats going on here and get some more cool stuff
5652143 we are excited about the seminar because many people have wanted to know more about tops their organization and what they found at secrest with the response we had from the first investigation i think its going to be successful
5652144 we have just enough religion to make us hate but not enough to make us love one another
5652145 i will not raise your taxes if you make less than 250 000 per year
5652146 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5652147 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5652148 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5652149 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5652150 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5652151 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5652152 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5652153 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5652154 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5652155 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5652156 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5652157 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5652158 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5652159 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5652160 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5652161 they were left with some financial debt so they really have a motive to run around the world
5652162 they come right out of the 60s to a lot of people it looks almost like theyre from a different planet

5652166 weightlifting is a big deal in nauru a nation of 10 000 about halfway between hawaii and australia even president marcus stephen is a former weightlifter who competed in three olympics
5652167 i think were just better at lifting than other sports
5652168 the pacific people are short but built very strong we think that weightlifting is the only sport that can take us up
5652169 detenamo 21 placed fourth in the group b session with the top rated lifters in the division set to compete in a later session he scored a total of 386 kg 851 pounds only missing the last of his six lifts
5652170 im not really satisfied if i had just made that last lift i would be happy

5652176 its a crisis of leadership a crisis of strategy and a crisis of what the future looks like for the supermajors
5652177 they are like a deer caught in headlights they know they have to move but they cant decide where to go
5652178 international companies have a portfolio of assets in areas of significant decline and no frontier discoveries to make up for that
5652179 there is still a lot of oil to develop out there which is why we dont call this geological peak oil especially in places like venezuela russia iran and iraq
5652180 would you like to be able to retire before youre 40
5652181 dont show your emotions because this is weak only women show their emotions
5652182 i feel i have already improved being down at west brom
5652183 playing with better players improves you and so does the experience of going to places like the emirates
5652184 this is our game in hand effectively and if we win that we would be level with denmark and two points behind finland
5652185 but all we need to do is win the next game
5652186 finland won their first five games and are in a great position
5652187 to finish top we need them to drop points but theres still a lot to play for and the important thing for us is to win our next game
5652188 many enterprise organizations grasp the benefits of server virtualization but they also need storage solutions that can support the dynamic mixed workload environments enabled by server virtualization
5652189 virtualized storage solutions like istors integrasuite that allow administrators to abstract logical storage from physical storage will make it possible for organizations to realize the full potential of a virtualized it environment
5652190 the product is easy to install configure and maintain and we are also very impressed with the high levels of service and support weve received from both the istor support team and our partner arbitech
5652191 the integrasuite management center was developed from extensive user feedback with the goal of minimizing the time users spend allocating and managing their storage while increasing their storage efficiency
5652192 istors unique virtualized storage functionality further enhances the customer experience with usability features not available with traditional architectures
5652193 if the footage shows any acts of misconduct that were perhaps missed by the match officials we will deal with it
5652194 the footage would have to be clear cut but there have been incidences in the past when players were banned on the strength of video evidence
5652195 tommy is a young lad but he has a responsibility to the club to his team mates and to himself this game is hard enough when it is 11 against 11 but i dont want to take the physical enthusiastic side of tommys game away from him
5652196 it was his first game we had a great support there and the lad was desperate to do well
5652197 he came on and he did really well he was very unlucky with his header as the goalkeeper made a great save he made a great tackle after running across the motherwell defence then he got involved in some silly things for which he was booked
5652198 ive had a word with tommy and told him he has to channel his aggression
5652199 if he misses games his bank balance will take a knock and he will miss games he is here to play and he has to give himself a chance
5652200 zander felt a tightness in his thigh and didnt want to take any risks
5652201 luckily enough it is not his ankle but it is still a blow to be without him
5652202 he came off at the right time and hasnt made the injury any worse hopefully he should be back following the international break

5652216 while these documents do not reveal direct coordination and assistance between the saddam regime and the al qaeda network they do indicate that saddam was willing to use albeit cautiously operatives affiliated with al qaeda as long as saddam could have these terrorist operatives monitored closely this created both the appearance of and in some ways a de facto link between the organizations at times these organizations would work together in pursuit of shared goals but still maintain their autonomy and independence because of innate caution and mutual distrust

5652230 it takes a strong character having to go through all of that pain and whatever mental anguish and come back and see me in all the glory
5652231 shes a true friend and im grateful to have had that along this journey
5652232 it was emotionally difficult for me going back to help her continue chasing her olympic dream while mine had been halted
5652233 but it was the right decision to make abandoning her right at the finish would have been much easier but selfish on my part i guess i felt that by helping her achieve her highest as the sole u s representative it would in some way be a small consolation for me and i could move on to focusing on 2012
5652234 we are both very excited to be together again after such a long year
5652235 this last year has been an incredible journey for both of us
5652236 and we will be bonded for life because of it
5652237 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
5652238 deet doesn t mask the smell of the host or jam the insect s senses mosquitoes don t like it because it smells bad to them
5652239 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound i couldn t believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom so i repeated the experiment over and over until we discussed the findings in the lab
5652240 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellent relatively little is known about how it actually works
5652241 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellents are compared

5652277 you could consider me to be a apple geek as it is the seventh computer i have bought from apple but it is also the worst
5652278 basically all macbook pro santa rosa and later models that have the nvidia graphics cards are failing at an alarming rate
5652279 apple and nvidia are desperately trying to sweep this under the carpet but i want as many reputable people to know about this big story as i can
5652280 i thought id let you know there is indeed a major issue at the moment that i would love to be highlighted in the media
5652281 if i sound bitter it is because i am a self employed graphic designer who paid a lot of money for apples flagship model only for it to last 13 months

5652293 teams of college students design a solar house knowing from the outset that it must be powered entirely by the sun in a quest to stretch every last watt of electricity thats generated by the solar panels on their roofs the students absorb the lesson that energy is a precious commodity they strive to innovate using high tech materials and design elements in ingenious ways along the way the students learn how to raise funds and communicate about team activities they collect supplies and talk to contractors they build their solar houses learning as they go

5652295 this april 2008 minnesotas 5th district republicans unanimously endorsed barb davis white for congress in the run against dfl incumbent keith ellison
5652296 barb white is one of the most dynamic speakers weve ever put before the voters the excitement that she brought to the convention was unprecedented in recent history her ability to convey the conservative message in an entertaining and engaging manner makes her a candidate worth seeing and worth your enthusiastic support
5652297 we need to support the gop candidates state wide to ensure an across the board win for minnesotas republican party
5652298 we need to stop the senseless killing of 3000 black babies and 6000 white babies each day by abortion clinics and follow the money

5652300 this paints an ugly picture for our community a school that can hold over 2000 students has only 400 i graduated from minneapolis north when i drive by the school it look bad like a blighted area what are we thinking north high school was once the pride of north minneapolis with the current democratic elected officials no one can cut a deal or make a change by redirect funding streams to give back the neighborhood to the people this will not be tolerated

5652316 people are really responding to the movie everything from tears to waiting in line to see it again
5652317 it was fascinating to know how much has happened in this one place and that its never been explored on film before
5652318 it really felt like time travel there were places in greenland that looked similar to the adirondacks without the forest cover we stood at the edge of a glacier and it did feel as if we were standing on an adirondack peak 12 000 years ago
5652319 it was the same technology used in filming planet earth for the bbc it was great to be up there knowing that we were making a real movie about the adirondacks and telling what we think is a really important story

5652328 must refer to your obligation to be respectful to the idf uniform and the full right of every student to enter your classroom in uniform
5652329 he explained that all military uniforms of the israeli army of fatah or of hamas are symbols of violence and that he does not allow them into his classroom some people at the college are not prepared to accept the kind of things he says from an arab
5652330 they wanted me to be the palestinian in the room and i refused to oblige they wanted to believe that i object to the army uniform because i am palestinian but i reject the uniform because it is opposed to my universal human values i acted as i did because i am a teacher and a human being what shocked me was that the committee refused to believe that could be my motivation

5652361 we think earnings expectations are 10 to 15 percent too high for 2009

5652379 it got very sophisticated because obviously the battery doesnt last long and then we had to look at circuits and interrupters so we have been working on it around two months with a crack team
5652380 the number of penalties will decrease and the quality of care will dramatically improve as hospitals take action to improve
5652381 the entire intent of these fines is to improve the overall quality of care in california
5652382 i am the pro of the hospital the other nurses call me to put in ivs that they cannot get in
5652383 being here has heightened the issue of israel and palestine
5652384 the american economy is an important issue because it affects the whole world
5652385 one of the issues for me is there needs to be a change in direction in foreign policy and our stance toward the arab world
5652386 american foreign policy especially since 9 11 seems like its being run by emotion not by intelligent thought
5652387 coming here didnt change my interest in foreign policy it just made me realize how important it was
5652388 living in lebanon i realized its of outsized importance to me what happens here
5652389 i mean barack obama talking about syria and iran thats actually important to me in a way that it wouldnt have been otherwise
5652390 the fact that obama came out here and visited all these people is a really positive thing
5652391 i dont think either candidate is going to solve the problems in the middle east i think u s foreign policy on the middle east has a long way to go
5652392 for me being here has heightened the issue of israel and palestine
5652393 that was a testament to six decades of bad policy
5652394 when i went to the refugee camp i realized that no one cares about the palestinians
5652395 the fate of the war in iraq affects lebanon and affects our relations with the middle east in general
5652396 whatever happens in iraq is going to have a ripple affect on everything
5652397 our relations with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinej d whats going to happen with that
5652398 of course id also like to know how to say foreign policy
5652399 in the minds of most people you rarely spend money to get nothing done
5652400 but in government people often spend vast sums of money to make sure nothing happens at all
5652401 you put the dysfunctionality and the sharp partisan issues together and the failure to get a bill is easy to describe
5652402 but to say nothings happened because of this money i dont agree with that
5652403 maybe they know who their friends are and they have other means of influencing them
5652404 people have absorbed the fact that its a real crisis and it will take complicated solutions to solve
5652405 they invest in people and they like to invest in people that will be around forever

5652435 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5652436 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5652437 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5652438 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5652439 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5652440 i could tell that most kids in the youth were not spending much of any time in prayer the truth is that the quiet nature of traditional prayer is just too slow too silent and too un technological to appeal to this generation instead of complaining about that i figured that we should go with it since every kid these days likes to text why not encourage them to do so
5652441 i text my friends all the time ever since my mom got me unlimited texting i probably text my friends more than i actually talk to them when pastor chad suggested that we text god at first it seemed a little weird but then after i did it a few times it was great now im texting god at least ten times per day which is way more than i ever used to think about him
5652442 i enjoy texting god but i do have a problem im always telling him about things i need but i never seem to hear back from him i have a blackberry bold so i can get e mail too he never seems to want to tell me anything
5652443 every conversation you have in life has a purpose or point
5652444 its easier to forget someone you loved and didnt love you back as oppose to being loved in return

5652457 it will be a one off opportunity to take to the road on foot and at the same time raise money for a great cause

5652462 last year generous cumbrians raised a staggering 71 000 from their coffee mornings you can help us raise even more in 2008 its as easy as putting the kettle on
5652463 simply get friends family or colleagues together and ask them to make a donation for the coffee they drink what could be easier
5652464 it was our daughter shelley who is 24 who took the call and at first we couldnt grasp what was going on we could see that she was upset then i spoke on the phone to david and he told me xenon had been stabbed
5652465 he said he was ok and they had called an ambulance david was trying to reassure me and seemed calm
5652466 david tried to reassure us telling us he was alright but we just jumped straight in our car and went to the cumberland infirmary
5652467 we were waiting for the ambulance then it arrived and though xenon was talking to us and even trying to joke he looked quite bad
5652468 wed been expecting a single stab wound but when we looked at him we realised hed got wounds to the side of his face the bridge of his nose his neck his back
5652469 we think there were about 14 wounds in all wed not expected that
5652470 one stab wound punctured the wall of his stomach and punctured his liver that was the worst wound and thats why they kept him in
5652471 on friday night the surgeon was telling xenon that he had no idea how lucky he had been he could easily have been killed or lost an eye
5652472 we just felt numb we started to think about how it might have turned out
5652473 on the night there were two kids killed with knives one in london and one in greater manchester
5652474 weve all been in fisticuffs as youngsters but to get a knife and stab somebody that many times i just dont understand it you worry about your kids society seems to have changed theres much more violence around
5652475 you hear about it all the time about how kids carry knives for protection its crazy i just cant understand the mentality of somebody who wants to do that
5652476 we were optimistic last week that we would be able to go ahead but inspection of the field on sunday night and the promise of more rain caused us to reluctantly change our minds and cancel the show
5652477 the field is waterlogged and there is no suitable alternative at this late stage
5652478 thankfully the field isnt too bad despite all the heavy rain

5652607 according to my estimates around 700 children have been killed in south ossetia during this war saakashvili is a monster i want to address him and say i want to strangle him with my bare hands for killing the young ones
5652608 we have evidence that georgians were high on drugs during the war that might explain why they were killing children senselessly
5652609 i have been unable to get a hold of him since the evening of august 7
5652610 they took away his phone i went to reason with them but they wouldnt tell me anything they told me nothing will change and asked me to cooperate
5652611 they told me it will be after the olympics which is a long time from now
5652612 they kidnapped me on the second floor of the state department at 10 30 a m and dragged me out from the back door i went on a hunger strike after they locked me up in shanghai on august 11 they took me to the putuo hospital to receive an iv injection for three days they said they would leave me alone as long as i dont appeal they followed me everywhere
5652613 i am under house arrest and monitored around the clock i appealed for my rights and the government treated me like an enemy the olympics have nothing to do with me but i lost my freedom because of it i dont know what i did wrong i am falsely accused over and over again i have lost my hope in the government

5652617 the fbi has completely shut congress out of its investigation into anthrax attacks on capitol hill and around the nation

5652619 this was an astonishing thing to do it should have been preserved as evidence this was a roadmap of everybody and anybody that had gotten access to develop the super strain that hit leahy and daschle
5652620 fbi scientists early on had but destroyed the unique strain of anthrax used in the deadly 2001 attacks that years later would lead them to dr bruce ivins this was anthrax that ivins took from his army lab in february 2002 and gave investigators

5652624 the arctic did not experience the meltdowns forecast by nsidc and the norwegian polar year secretariat it didnt even come close additionally some current graphs and press releases from nsidc seem less than conservative there appears to be a consistent pattern of overstatement related to arctic ice loss

5652716 in an election season driven by the desire for change and a demand by working families for better jobs better wages pension security and health care for all americans it should come as no surprise that wal mart is weighing in heavily and possibly illegally with its employees over the choices they face this november
5652717 afraid to say we need a stronger labor movement in this country
5652718 tactics are designed to intimidate their employees and discourage them from considering choices that would strengthen their voices on the job and bring tangible change for all american workers
5652719 zimbabwes annual rate of inflation surged in june to 11 2 million percent the government owned herald reported
5652720 it gained 9 035 045 5 percentage points from the may rate of 2 233 713 4
5652721 the figure which has has been released by the central statistics office is an understatement the actual figure could be high as 40 million percent in june he said
5652722 the actual figure for july can be much high as 300 million per cent while for august it could be 600 million per cent he added
5652723 zimbabweans must realise that the country is in a practically binding state of socio economic emergency the herald quoted reserve bank governor gideon gono as saying then
5652724 as such there is need for a universal moratorium on all incomes and prices for a minimum period of six months gono said

5652733 what do you think of this phelps legendary streak it is pretty impressive
5652734 i hear theres some athlete winning some medals is that what youre talking about
5652735 if the footage shows any acts of misconduct that were perhaps missed by the match officials we will deal with it
5652736 the footage would have to be clear cut but there have been incidences in the past when players were banned on the strength of video evidence
5652737 tommy is a young lad but he has a responsibility to the club to his team mates and to himself this game is hard enough when it is 11 against 11 but i dont want to take the physical enthusiastic side of tommys game away from him
5652738 it was his first game we had a great support there and the lad was desperate to do well
5652739 he came on and he did really well he was very unlucky with his header as the goalkeeper made a great save he made a great tackle after running across the motherwell defence then he got involved in some silly things for which he was booked
5652740 ive had a word with tommy and told him he has to channel his aggression
5652741 if he misses games his bank balance will take a knock and he will miss games he is here to play and he has to give himself a chance
5652742 zander felt a tightness in his thigh and didnt want to take any risks
5652743 luckily enough it is not his ankle but it is still a blow to be without him
5652744 he came off at the right time and hasnt made the injury any worse hopefully he should be back following the international break
5652745 ferrari has the ability and resources to work on next years car without having to relax for one moment on continuing the development of the f2008 in a championship that is proving to be very tight between ourselves and our usual opponents
5652746 we are now in a delicate phase of the season with no way to recover from any mistakes one step in the wrong direction could prove very costly
5652747 at the risk of repeating ourselves our aim is the same as ever to ensure that every element of our package and team works to its maximum as we strive to bring home as many points as possible and hopefully be the first to put our names on a valencia trophy
5652748 the track looks very interesting combining a variety of different corner types as well as some sections with a high top speed maybe slightly lower than those seen at the montreal circuit in canada
5652749 we can expect high temperatures this weekend which should not present us with any problems

5652753 playing with better players improves you and so does the experience of going to places like the emirates
5652754 this is our game in hand effectively and if we win that we would be level with denmark and two points behind finland
5652755 but all we need to do is win the next game
5652756 finland won their first five games and are in a great position
5652757 to finish top we need them to drop points but theres still a lot to play for and the important thing for us is to win our next game
5652758 anyone who tries anything like that will face a crushing response

5652766 if the concerns of the international community are taken care of then i think you can achieve your objective
5652767 it is your foreign policy how can i say anything about it
5652768 i do not have any comment on it it is news to me
5652769 i prefer not to discuss we will watch the developments
5652770 hosiery items worth millions of rupees will be left unsold unless the government takes measures to transport woollens from ludhiana to jammu and kashmir
5652771 as winter ends we start making woollen items like sweaters jackets shawls and caps for the next season this time we procured a huge quantity of blankets from other states as the demand is quite good in the kashmir valley but the highway blockade has severely affected our business
5652772 this time we have hardly got any order till date
5652773 on the one hand the woollen industry is facing the problem of marketing products in the valley on the other the price of dyed yarn has doubled adding to the cost
5652774 we pray that the issue is resolved amicably the future of thousands of people who are involved in this trade is at stake
5652775 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5652776 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5652777 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5652778 i shop at the 99cent stores there are ways of saving money
5652779 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
5652780 we really want to get the message out to people
5652781 i got back the standard form letter thank you for your comment
5652782 sometimes when grownups say forever they mean for a very long time
5652783 at first i didnt want her to be the kumari id be sad without her so i hid her upstairs but they insisted and took her and said you shouldnt talk like that
5652784 they told us her horoscope matched exactly so we couldnt say no my mother in law said something bad might happen if we didnt let her go and it was good for the family name so although we were sad we let her go
5652785 if she was with me at home it would be so much fun we would play together
5652786 i would not like to be separated from my parents and i wouldnt have any friends in school i can go to school and i can go outside as well
5652787 the key deprivation is she cannot live with her mother or father she must live in a temple without them as a child you have a right to grow up in your own community with your own family as a kumari you cannot you cannot play with your friends because you are a goddess
5652788 how many people now really believe that kumari is really a goddess they just follow it because its a practice
5652789 the king used to go as head of the hindu kingdom but in all these religious ceremonies now its the prime minister who goes
5652790 she belongs to a narrow religious tradition of just one small ethnic group nepal has many
5652791 we call on the government and judicial authorities to ensure the protection of prisoners to punish torturers and not to include them on amnesty lists
5652792 its true that there is no specific law but they torturers could be charged for voluntary blows and injuries
5652793 the culprits are being investigated but this type of case takes time
5652794 we dont have statistics for previous years but there were definitely hundreds of cases of torture in 2004 and 2005 before the number started to decline in 2006
5652795 68 inmates died in prison for various reasons such as
5652796 there is also torture during interrogations carried out by inexperienced investigators who want to extort information or those who want to steal money
5652797 you go through and look at how the definition of planet has evolved over time and they all have one thing in common the basic characteristic of a planet is they go around the sun historically
5652798 this is a dynamical definition so to say you cant use dynamics that somehow its wrong to use dynamics in order to characterize a planet is historically inaccurate thats the way weve always defined planets
5652799 they are planets in all but name they just happen to be going around jupiter
5652800 the pick up in the german zew index in august shows that investors expectations for the economy have improved but this is little consolation given the still low level of the index
5652801 the dollars recent rise was driven mainly by falls in oil prices
5652802 but because the majority view is that there is more room for falls in oil prices the dollars current fall is only a correction and its expected to resume rising again
5652803 the grimmer view may prompt some players to start speculating about a higher possibility of a rate cut down the road
5652804 but because interest rate differentials between countries are not a trading factor right now such speculation would have little impact
5652805 and while some of these steps may require you to do a little extra work now in the long run it may save you aggravation money and even your house

5652861 we are taking a giant step forward toward developing a health care system that focuses on quality and affordability through the implementation of health information technology
5652862 the greatly expanded icd 10 code sets will enable hhs to fully support quality reporting pay for performance bio surveillance and other critical activities conversion to icd 10 is essential to development of a nationwide electronic health information environment and the updated x12 transaction standards are a critical step in the implementation of these new codes
5652863 now is the right time to move forward with the transition from icd 9 to icd 10
5652864 we recognize that the transition to icd 10 will require some upfront costs but each year of delay would create additional costs both because of the limitations of icd 9 and because of the need to employ the greater precision that icd 10 codes provide to support value based purchasing of health care and other initiatives we will continue to work collaboratively across the health care system to ensure a smooth transition to use of the updated transaction standards and icd 10

5652876 a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president
5652877 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent
5652878 all his bluster distortions and negative attacks notwithstanding it is hard to understand how senator mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5652879 the difference in this race is that john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5652880 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5652881 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5652882 because he has the judgment vision and character to lead this country in the 21st century

5652930 this assignment will help labour fund strengthen various financing programmes for smes and also to identify solutions for various other challenges faced by bahraini entrepreneurs

5652934 the sbi hrudaya suraksha scheme is being launched as a pilot project to evaluate the concept of offering loan on easy interest terms for those below poverty line earning less than 2 a day who need urgent cardiac intervention
5652935 once the concept is evolved from the pilot project the loan scheme will be offered from our health cities in ahmedabad jaipur jamshedpur and kolkata the game plan is to build a financial security network for poorer sections of society who do not have enough money at hand for medical eventualities
5652936 the hospital will bear the interest amount for the first three months after the surgery the loan has to be fully repaid with interest due in six months of treatment though no collateral security is required the loan is sanctioned in joint names with the patient and his her spouse or kin as co borrower
5652937 around eight percent of total cardiac patients can afford a heart surgery even at a conservative rate of rs 100 000 while the remaining 92 percent have to be taken care of through bank loans or health insurance
5652938 strange as it may sound in india it is not a young son who takes his father for a heart surgery but the other way around there is an urgent need to create a network to offer healthcare at an affordable price and help the needy to raise funds for the heart operation

5652973 as the world flips over from a predominantly rural to a predominantly urban population base cities are going to take more and more water for agriculture
5652974 however most of the water going into urban areas comes out the other end in the sewers
5652975 we know that there is an informal sector within many cities that is using wastewater to grow vegetables but there has been no data on how much of this water was being used or what the risks were
5652976 it is a pretty useful way of treating water in the sense that if the water just went straight into a river it would cause a lot more eutrophication problems further downstream
5652977 so in a way it is performing an ecological service by cleaning up some of the water and recycling the nutrients
5652978 if this practice is going to be increasingly commonplace and more and more people are going to be eating food produced this way then there needs to be a bit more concern about the heavy metals and other contaminants in there
5652979 ideally the end product should be treating the water to a standard that means there is no risk but most developing nations cannot afford to do this
5652980 apparently what happens now in areas with very polluted water is that the farmers do a smell test or a taste test

5653034 compartimos con el gobierno nacional el objetivo de dar continuidad a las inversiones en infraestructura que permitan afianzar el desarrollo integral de nuestra provincia articulando el crecimiento econ mico con equidad social y equilibrio territorial
5653035 para hacerlo posible estamos trabajando codo a codo con la gente de la producci n en cada departamento conformando consorcios cooperando creando consejos viales y productivos que nos ayuden a ser cada vez m s eficientes en esta tarea tan importante de mejorar la red vial provincial esto tambi n es un objetivo cumplido en relaci n a la idea de gobierno y ciudadanos trabajando juntos con fines p blicos

5653046 el ofrecimiento es insuficiente pero precisamos el mandato de los trabajadores para tomar una definici n
5653047 no es un aumento ni recomposici n salarial ni llega a ser un paliativo porque se pone como una alternativa al presentismo son 150 o 170 pesos por presentismo que adem s por el monto ofrecido no lo representa
5653048 nosotros esperaremos el mandato de las bases para definir qu es lo que hacemos de aqu hacia adelante
5653049 hasta ahora tuvimos gestos a la espera de una respuesta por parte del gobierno pero la paciencia se agota
5653050 es ante la demora del estado en dar una respuesta definitiva a los requerimientos se inici la negociaci n en la que el gobierno realiz una oferta luego tuvimos algunas reuniones m s quedaron en contestarnos pero a n no hubo respuestas
5653051 los trabajadores decidieron comenzar con el plan de lucha en funci n que se demostr desde nuestro sector que hubo much sima voluntad para solucionar el conflicto pero que sin que haya respuestas del otro lado la paciencia se agota
5653052 los trabajadores manifiestan con la protesta su disconformidad y eso se refleja en el ndice de acatamiento esto no nos pone contento porque es un acto extremo pero es el nimo de la gente de todas maneras la semana que viene por esta nos reuniremos para ver como seguimos y definiremos si las medidas se profundizar n

5653100 death of a church occurs when unbelievers are allowed to take over ministries in the church it happens when a church becomes more concerned with form and liturgy than it is with life on a spiritual level death occurs when a church becomes more concerned about welfare and social ills than it is about salvation it happens when a church loves systems more than it loves jesus christ and it happens when a church becomes more concerned with material things than spiritual reality thats how a church dies it all is a result of sin sin in any form that the church tolerates whether it is in the members or the leaders tolerance of sin begins the cycle then comes the tolerance of unbelievers in the church until no one cares who is a believer or an unbeliever the end comes when the man who runs the church isnt a believer sins of commission and omission kill a church little by little when that happens christians become carnal soon afterwards unbelievers come into the church and then a total tolerance for sin exists the church begins to die and the people who really love jesus christ leave only to be replaced by people who dont know him
5653101 nothing living should ever be treated with contempt whatever it is that lives a man a tree or a bird should be touched gently because the time is short civilization is another word for respect for life
5653102 the needs of the natural world are more important than the needs of any economic system
5653103 they will help you get off the street counsel you with prayer and you your life back in order
5653104 a one step center for homeless veterans so they dont have to go here and there and they dont keep falling through the cracks
5653105 certainly thats a good gesture to help with that and working with us to ensure those kids are safe it doesnt eliminate the concerns but i am glad its there

5653114 zimbabwes annual rate of inflation surged in june to 11 2 million percent the government owned herald reported
5653115 it gained 9 035 045 5 percentage points from the may rate of 2 233 713 4
5653116 the figure which has has been released by the central statistics office is an understatement the actual figure could be high as 40 million percent in june he said
5653117 the actual figure for july can be much high as 300 million per cent while for august it could be 600 million per cent he added
5653118 zimbabweans must realise that the country is in a practically binding state of socio economic emergency the herald quoted reserve bank governor gideon gono as saying then
5653119 as such there is need for a universal moratorium on all incomes and prices for a minimum period of six months gono said
5653120 investors had pinned their hopes on the outcome of the talks kingdom bank said in a report issued late last week movement at the station
5653121 we cant make anything public until the probe is completed
5653122 im heading a team of nikamma worthless personnels i have nothing to say to the media
5653123 they said they couldnt make an announcement while there is a game on
5653124 what i dont understand is how come they can announce car registration numbers during the game but cant call for someone whos just lost a family member i just think it was out of order
5653125 i hope nothing serious ever happens to anyones relatives while the game is on what happens if someones teenage son is in a car accident and someone wants to get hold of them in the stadium are they going to be told no the games only 54 minutes in
5653126 our seats are just a few rows from the front so my husband went up to one of the security staff explained and asked if they could make an announcement for my dad over the speaker she checked with someone on her radio then told us they couldnt make an announcement while the game was still on
5653127 we walked round to the west stand and the woman at reception was very understanding but because we didnt know exactly where my dad was sitting no one could go and get him we had to sit and wait for him to come out at the end of the match
5653128 the club is saddened to hear the news about the familys loss and have communicated with the family to offer sincere condolences
5653129 the club has procedures in place to provide pa announcements during matches and is currently liaising with the relevant stewarding company to consider the circumstances surrounding saturdays events
5653130 sono fermo da tre giorni e sono gi di morale qui mi rimangono quattro allenamenti e se ho una ricaduta non credo che avr la possibilit di gareggiare
5653131 sar la mia ultima presenza in nazionale la prima fu nel 1991
5653132 how do i decide how much i can really afford
5653133 i was very conscious this was an issue when i was the minister and we always took a strong line on attacks on staff and that was backed up by this act
5653134 unfortunately it is being shown to be a very necessary piece of legislation
5653135 the important thing is to send out a very strong message that it is unacceptable and back that up with strong legal measures
5653136 some of it can be explained by the fact some people under a lot of stress will act in uncharacteristic ways and hit out at whoever is next to them
5653137 on other occasions like people attacking fire engines its just mindless stupidity
5653138 every public service professional deserves protection from threatening or abusive behaviour
5653139 its a very busy branch and its not as if this post office is losing money for them
5653140 customers would have to go to newington and they wont be able to cope because it will be too busy with all our customers too
5653141 this branch is handy for people because it is on the bus route
5653142 there is also sheltered housing right in front of us
5653143 all we can do now is try to fight it
5653144 reducing the hours of these post offices tantamount to closure will cause great difficulty to those who rely on the services available at branches particularly the elderly and disabled
5653145 there is still time to save these post office services
5653146 taking the decision to close any post office branch is always very difficult and we know will cause concern to many of our customers
5653147 we want to ensure that everyone who uses relies on or has any concern with post office services is both fully aware of the proposed changes and able to give views on them
5653148 we believe these proposals offer the best prospect for a sustainable way forward for post office services in edinburgh the lothians and south of scotland bearing in mind the minimum access criteria and the other factors to which we have to have regard
5653149 this was just daft if the council had carried out a proper consultation in the first place then none of this would have happened
5653150 the council says it did carry out a consultation when this was first suggested a few years ago but a couple of notices tied to a lamp post is not really good enough
5653151 that section of the road is far too narrow for a bus stop of that nature the biggest problem with the new bus stop was that it jutted out so far into the road that traffic has been struggling to get past stopping buses
5653152 the problem is that nobody really knew about the plans until it was too late and it was only when they saw it getting built that it was obvious it would cause problems
5653153 it maybe says something about the way this council consults people but we are where we are
5653154 this was just not a good site for one of these bus boarders and there would have been too much traffic building up not to mention that you can hardly fit two buses past each other at that point
5653155 there are good points for these build out bus stops in terms of improved wheelchair access but they got it wrong this time and im glad to see that being recognised
5653156 the councils then executive approved the eastern corridor bus priority scheme at its meeting on july 31 2007
5653157 the approved scheme included re designing the road layout to provide a bus shelter in newhaven road at the location in question
5653158 we have listened to local peoples current concerns that the new pavement layout could cause delays to local traffic and in consultation with the ward councillors we have decided to change the design
5653159 the box office has been telling everyone that its sold out and thats if you can get through its just hopeless its only two days before the event a lot of people have been phoning up its chaotic
5653160 i feel sorry for the youngsters there are some really good musicians and theyre in their home city
5653161 weve sold 207 tickets but we could have sold far more i do think they should be offering compensation
5653162 we were made aware of a problem with edinburgh youth orchestra string ensemble summer concert which takes place this thursday the technical fault was identified and tickets were immediately returned to sale
5653163 tickets for the concert were being bought through the fringe box office on saturday so we believe the problem only caused difficulties for ticket buyers on sunday
5653164 its come as a shock you just dont expect that to happen

5653181 this community has been the most successful in scotland in matching what was community regeneration funding pound for pound so that gives you some indication of the scale of the problem we are facing
5653182 whether through inexperience or a lack of knowledge and understanding of the potential implications wrong decisions have been made
5653183 it is time for the politicians to wake up and give some direction to this sorry state of affairs
5653184 we are concerned that services in forth will effectively be cut by 800 000 not exactly fair
5653185 there has been much discussion on this matter over the last few months but misinformation and distortion of the facts has created a great deal of disquiet and unnecessary anxiety
5653186 the index used to judge funding identifies areas and pockets of deprivation across the city not only in areas which have traditionally been identified as disadvantaged
5653187 i appreciate that this period of transition and refocusing of activities is difficult for some existing projects
5653188 i worry when so called experts dont actually know what they are trying to achieve looking at this debacle you can understand why
5653189 everybodys a bit unsure because theres been a lot of new build four new schools going up the flats coming down 230 houses being replaced but as for fires we have our usual vandalism but its nothing compared to other areas i dont think people are afraid to walk the streets
5653190 weve got a small nucleus of kids that cause havoc every now and again but thats all
5653191 weve lost lots of green space and this is a lot of what the youngsters problem is theyve nowhere to go
5653192 theyve got huge fences around them and theyre locked so the kids cant play on them its a nice facility but theres more fencing than a prison to keep the kids out
5653193 we have got trouble with the kids they come and sit in front of the window sometimes they shout at my door and run away they come inside and squirt the sauces at us and when they stay inside sometimes my customers are disturbed and they dont want to come again my regular customers the families i maybe lose 150 200 a week because of that
5653194 i think people are more annoyed with the kids than scared its not a bad area theyre well kept houses mostly owner occupied now and folk have a pride in this area its a choice area to come to but every area has its troublemakers

5653202 why as a once celtic supporter with its strong catholic irish allegiances should i cheer on a team known to attract extreme protestants well religio
5653203 i deplore the bigotry of sectarianism that still blights soccer in scotland especially in clashes between celtic who field the emerald green of catholic ireland against the blue of protestant rangers lets have the referee raise the red card to all bigots be they blue or green and send such mindless prejudice off the field for ever
5653204 of course i wanted to be clearly understood i practised articulating my words more distinctly yet at the same time i wanted to retain the personality of my own voice and to be honest to my edinburgh roots
5653205 discussions are ongoing between our officials and lothian buses but we are hopeful of reaching some sort of compromise
5653206 we cant find the 300 000 originally suggested but we are looking to see if there is any other way money can be squeezed out of other areas to help the situation
5653207 it is critical that the city finds a way of ensuring that these cuts are not implemented
5653208 these services are absolutely vital for large parts of this city and if they are taken away then many people simply dont have any other choices
5653209 if they can find the best part of 1 3m for flags then i think they can find some money to keep these services going

5653220 even at the very end of his life douglas was harrowed by his sense of failure to live long enough to see independence realised
5653221 it was then in the last few hours together that i promised him that in the forthcoming election for the scottish parliament i would vote snp and that his lifetime endeavour would have my continuing support
5653222 gigantic experiment i think with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
5653223 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand

5653228 theft is theft no matter which way you look at it and no matter what water the criminals muddy and have no doubt there will be a reckoning and those responsible will face some sort of justice it is a strategy to loot the equipment so that they will have excuses if there is a shortage like in this case they are saying some of the equipment has been stolen or vandalized
5653229 this is not the first time that they stole the equipment at night there are some tractors that were commissioned by vice president mujuru in zvavahera in the run up to the elections the tractors were never given to farmers yet they are nowhere to be seen now

5653231 nothing in this section shall prevent the state from carrying on transactions in such a manner as the state may require and if so requested by the state the bank shall make the necessary arrangements to this end
5653232 in the same vein no successful economic turn around can be achieved in an environment where the judiciary system is acutely under funded
5653233 they promised to come to some agreement in two weeks and they have not done that they have not even told people what the reasons are this is really a display of politicians collectively both zanu pf and mdc being extremely arrogant
5653234 if he wants to run the country he must get back to what has always been the way forward he must put pressure here and build a force here that pushes mugabe out so he should pull out of the talks
5653235 remember that the smaller component of the mdc will never vote tsvangirai in a closed session i think they have always been against tsvangirai

5653279 but i dont think there is any talk of postponement at this stage and i believe the tournament is going to take place as scheduled in pakistan

5653284 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and to weaken the georgian state

5653287 the importance of primary sulphate is usually ignored in assessments of the impact of ship emissions on air quality because less than 7 of all sulphur emitted by ships is found in primary sulphate particles but our results suggest that this component of ship emissions is important and should not be ignored in the future knowing how much sulphate from ships is in the air will also allow us to better understand what happens to the other 93 of sulphur emitted by ships
5653288 this is the first study that shows the contribution of ships to fine particulates in the atmosphere
5653289 ships are really unregulated when it comes to air pollution standards what we wanted to find out was the contribution of ships to the air pollution in san diego and what we found was a surprise because no one expected that the contribution from ships of solid sulphur rich particles called primary sulphate would be so high
5653290 like children who learn a new language more easily than adults so too did the cats and dogs learn their new language more easily the younger they were
5653291 an analogy can be drawn with homes in which a dog is adopted either before or after a baby is born when the dog enters a home with a baby in residence the status quo is already in place however when the baby is born after the dog has become accustomed to a certain amount of attention and the focus now turns to the newborn child the status quo is altered and the dog will often display behaviour resembling jealousy
5653292 cats are territorial animals and are likely to be stressed and therefore less able to learn when removed from familiar surroundings whereas puppies territories are usually centred on familiar people rather than specific places
5653293 only in recent years has there been a substantial effort to manufacture child friendly formulations of first line tuberculosis drugs such as crushable mini pills granules oral suspensions
5653294 and in the past 15 years children have been included in only one study of new agents for tuberculosis a large phase 3 trial evaluating once weekly rifapentine isoniazid for treatment of latent tuberculosis
5653295 children have the same right to benefit from research as do adults while this lack of involvement may be understandable in the short term it is not acceptable in the long term
5653296 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
5653297 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
5653298 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound i couldnt believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom so i repeated the experiment over and over until we discussed the findings in the lab
5653299 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellent relatively little is known about how it actually works
5653300 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellents are compared

5653329 our all new 2009 dodge challenger is a modern day muscle machine representing the best from the past and present
5653330 nearly 40 years following the debut of the original we are bringing dodge challenger back and loading it with essential hardware styling and technology desired by todays buyer
5653331 our designers captured the view of what people today remember about the dodge challenger from nearly 40 years ago
5653332 their challenge was to excite todays customer by capturing the emotion of the original challenger while offering todays comfort and performance
5653333 it takes longer but id feel like a rock star turning up on a bus
5653334 now if its a crassism to ask people to put up a peace sign at a time when were at war in two countries were shafted and therefore im going to retire from the music industry in january because im disgusted by it i dont want nothing to do with it no more
5653335 im going to retire from the music industry because its run by rich white men who are very conservative and have been around too long they dont wanna hear anybody with anything truly rebellious to say and thats why british indie music has stalled for the last ten years
5653336 i got herded into that pop game by the management i had at the time now im gonna go to venezuela and go on
5653337 i would never have been allowed to do that before i would never have been allowed to say anything of a political nature because it didnt square with their idea of what a pop artist is mmmtobby

5653339 lack of goals is lack of faith you know why most of us never accomplish what we want because we dont know what we want

5653345 we worden geen mobiele virtuele operator we maken gebruik van het netwerk en de expertise van proximus maar kunnen wel onze eigen merknaam en eigen prijsmodel lanceren

5653348 yeah that vampire weekend record really is a shitty album
5653349 de mamma van bas zal inmiddels ook al wel bevallen zijn
5653350 i dont want anything to do with this industry it absolutely stinks
5653351 im gonna go out having told the truth and with my head held high and having stood for something
5653352 i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their 50s who went to private school its not something i want to be part of
5653353 you get these bands who have a few hits say like the pigeon detectives who come out with another album trying to do the same thing again
5653354 im going to make a record thats truly artistic which is the reverend and the makers album thats artistically interesting then im going to retire and become a pedal taxi driver
5653355 its all done for profit and not for any degree of musical feeling or sentiment
5653356 and the press distort things to such a degree that youve not got a hope of knowing what the truth is so its not something that i want to participate in or fuel anymore
5653357 he was a great journalist and a great man and we will all miss him so much
5653358 huge contribution to bbc wales over many years in a wide range of programming
5653359 first as a current affairs journalist but above all as someone who got to the heart of the sporting world that is so important to wales
5653360 he combined great knowledge and enthusiasm with humour and wit
5653361 first class broadcaster who had the talent and personality to re create the excitement and buzz of sporting events for hundreds of thousands of people
5653362 it was through the cricket we first met and he loved the game and quite often we met up for a couple of beers at the dynefor arms
5653363 he would say go on barry give me a pass it didnt matter whether it was on the floor or over his head he was so enthusiastic
5653364 there was no rivalry we were very good friends and i guess it showed on screen
5653365 people would come up to him as if he was some sort of uncle they felt they really knew him
5653366 as the face of bbc wales sports coverage for many years bobs passion love and understanding of sport created beautiful writing and first class journalism
5653367 along with his wider contribution to news and current affairs at the bbc his commitment to journalism in wales was second to none
5653368 come back a mother amp daughters journey through hell and back
5653369 rear units as well as second and third echelon units are being pulled back first the vanguard units will be pulled back at the final stage
5653370 we could leave here in two minutes but weve had no orders to pull out
5653371 practically speaking there are so far no signs of withdrawal at all what theyre trying to do is to widen their territorial presence
5653372 they have pretty much unrestricted freedom of action they are trying to show us they are masters on the ground right now
5653373 i might be naive but im still hopeful that a very strong common effort by europe and the united states will be effective in the withdrawing of russian troops from territory of georgia
5653374 according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5653375 war columns are already leaving the main pullout will take place today it takes a long time to pack up a tank
5653376 russian forces are not leaving they are merely rotating their hardware one comes another one goes
5653377 my roommates were out one sunday when my boyfriend came over for lunch
5653378 i could tell he was horny but i figured that id take care of it after wed eat
5653379 i work in a physical therapy office giving real massages to injured people and seniors
5653380 i dont do this hottie sweetie jennifer max loves to play hard game with a hunky dude starts from caressing and squeezing and ends up with fucking scene jennifer was so agr
5653381 my bloke and i have been together for three years and were really chuffed that were going to be parents
5653382 je stopt heel veel energie in een pan met water doet de aardappels er een tijdje bij en vervolgens gooi je het hete water weg
5653383 als argument hoor je vaak dat voor extra besparingen nieuwe technologie n nodig zijn en dat zoiets tijd kost onzin zweedse huizen verbruiken nu al twee keer zo weinig energie als de nederlandse terwijl het in zweden kouder is de technologie is er gewoon het is een kwestie van voorschrijven
5653384 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer some virologists believe that this would insure that the man made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them
5653385 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist public relations efforts to the contrary
5653386 justice there can never be justice i think the scale of justice should be balanced but for the rest of her life she will deal with the consequences
5653387 its terrible but now it seems to be a trend all of a sudden
5653388 these people know they are vulnerable and they go after them i think its hard times theyre doing whatever they need to survive but an old lady come on
5653389 but i wasnt going to keep my kids from eating nutritious healthy food just because of my own stigma
5653390 our increased fuel price to get or to deliver food and decreased availability and higher cost of food
5653391 its allowed us to keep our house and keep our car and start to pay medical bills and keep our family intact
5653392 congress has already passed an emergency supplemental to take care of the costs of the war in iraq
5653393 what we havent done is pass an emergency supplemental to take care of the emergency costs in this country
5653394 i needed to go down to the basement and just sit
5653395 families arent aware of it or they have misconceptions that it wont be good for the patient or that the patient wont want to go or the staff wont be able to handle their mother or somehow it isnt right to leave her
5653396 they often dont have the opportunity to explore these ideas
5653397 im a good daughter i can take care of her myself
5653398 i looked at my husband and i felt sorry for him i knew he needed a break and i realized that i did too much as i love my mother im married and we need to take care of each other
5653399 what kind of daughter am i leaving her for four days
5653400 i felt i was being selfish why do i need this time away from her
5653401 she used to do a word puzzle all the time
5653402 she refused to do it at home but she was doing it wonderfully there once she came home it was no to everything she went right back down they told me that was normal the primary caregiver gets the least cooperation
5653403 we also act as advocates for the person in the medical system
5653404 i could tell the entire time that she had not been bathed
5653405 we could hear her screaming as we were walking down the hall it was awful
5653406 get on the phone and say when are you going to get me
5653407 at that point im already relaxed but when it happens at the front end it takes a minute for me to readjust
5653408 one family set up a message hi mom were having a good time
5653409 ive witnessed clients say on the phone how could you do this to me i hate it here and the daughter feels guilty and yet mom is having a great time at the bingo game
5653410 this is an area where theres a lot of hype and not much substance
5653411 many products just refer to retinol or vitamin a as a buzzword
5653412 o t c products tend to try to walk the line between effects and side effects
5653413 but many intentionally keep the concentration too low to have any benefit
5653414 if something shows true biological activity its regulated as a drug
5653415 a cream bought over the counter is certainly not going to do what prescription strength retinol will do
5653416 its a matter of the kind of problem a person perceives and how he wants to deal with it
5653417 for these treatments which have sound research behind them and for people who want to improve their appearance the benefits far outweigh any problems
5653418 for irish stuff veterans stuff union stuff and senior stuff
5653419 but listen if she loses shes unemployed and im going to have to pay her rent so i am going to check you as a yes thanks so much
5653420 nobody touches anybody you never saw us kiss did you
5653421 its nice to know that he is pulling for me and supporting me
5653422 people in her district seem to require a lot of hand holding
5653423 i think now that she is not cutting it short enough
5653424 i hate to admit it but he is probably right and others who are actually communications professionals have noted that
5653425 the mayor says he travels by subway he hardly uses the subway
5653426 if you volunteer on a lot of peoples campaigns and send out troops
5653427 then they are obligated to vote for you then and it worked she got to be the speaker
5653428 an all purpose schlepper which is critical in politics and government things need to be moved from place to place things need to be picked up things need to be mailed
5653429 all my pals are dead or are not taking visitors anymore
5653430 because they have chicken as opposed to some kind of mystery meat i went to a lot of them i was cautioned not to take anything not to eat anything i was presented as christines father the old guy
5653431 you stand around look personable i have my picture taken she made me go i didnt want to go
5653432 if they wanted to i would talk to people about the old days about how terrible things are now
5653433 i go to things as speaker that i think he would like to go to so we go to them together
5653434 im against the nuclear power plant on governors island im for rent protection and im for congestion pricing
5653435 you must know how the place runs certainly if you run half the city there is no reason you cannot shift and do the other half of the city
5653436 if left on the plant there are usually so many buds that the spent flowers would drop down onto the largest buds and interfere with their opening
5653437 you have to have a passion for one particular plant my passion is rhododendrons after i got a lot of them i realized thats just a few months of bloom in the spring and early summer so then i got onto daylilies and went overboard on them but between the two things they give me many weeks of colour
5653438 were going to try to get where they towed and got lobsters we had reports of boats that got 80 to as high as 240 lobsters to a tow
5653439 they will be reset a few times over the next week to 10 days in a variety of areas
5653440 theres been no storms so if we can catch damaged lobster how are they going to be able to blame it on the storm this year
5653441 were doing this for all the communities around here because everybody knows when lobster fishing is gone this place is going to be a ghost town
5653442 ik trek het mij persoonlijk aan dat u de waarde van uw beleggingen zo hebt zien kelderen

5653455 zudem steckt grunds tzlich in der frage nach der entlohnung einer arbeit eine falle in die viele hinein tappen da ist einmal die zu leistende arbeit f r die wir bezahlt werden m nner erhalten mehr als frauen wenn wir den gegenwert f r die arbeit ausschlie lich monet r betrachten dann sind wir die verliererinnen gehen wir aber davon aus das jedes arbeitsfeld dar ber hinaus eine erweiterung der f higkeiten und die damit verbundene lust und freude beinhaltet dann sieht die sache anders aus und wenn ich mir m nner und frauen so ansehe muss ich einfach sagen viele frauen sind grunds tzlich besser drauf sie haben ihr arbeitslernfeld derart gewinn bringend bewirtschaftet das es ein wahres vergn gen ist das kapital liegt letztlich nicht auf dem konto sondern im herz und in einem heiter funktionierenden hirn

5653466 i am quite happy but we still have to find the right speed for the corners i still have to learn a lot about the car and the tyres too overall my first tarmac rally with a world rally car has been mixed finding the right set up for this rally requires vast experience
5653467 it was frustrating it started well on friday and i had a good position and feeling with the car but yesterday and today were just nightmares
5653468 its the most difficult of the asphalt rallies as the surface changes all the time i learned that on aggressive asphalt im ok but on a smoother surface im far away in my car set up and confidence level
5653469 i had a new experience in comparing pirellis hard and soft compound tyres they did a good job for us and were strong
5653470 this rally also showed me how important mental preparation is i need to work on that this week before rally new zealand and start from zero again to move forward i also want to complete some asphalt training before the next rally on that surface in spain in october
5653471 ricky wants the brand to represent not only style and performance but also for quality and value for money

5653474 the playstation 4 and xbox 720 will arrive in 2011 or 2012 we think
5653475 but this is just our estimate we dont know and even if microsoft and sony told us i couldnt say because it would be under nda
5653476 but we think in three to four years time although there are good reasons why it should be 2010 already but well see

5653480 while economists argue about whether or not we are in a recession there is no question that in our markets the impact of the economic slowdown has been recession like that we continue to hold our own is a testament to the commitment and dedication of our associates the loyalty of our customers the strength reliability and performance of our product offerings and the quality of our customer service
5653481 we are already starting to see signs we are at or nearing the bottom of the trough we have continued to invest in marketing and distribution and are starting to benefit from a number of extremely positive developments the direct distribution agreement we are entering into with lowes beginning january 2009 the acquisition by aert of the choicedek r brand from weyerhaeuser the overhead restructuring and process re engineering we have undertaken to reduce costs and increase efficiencies the launch of a new line of products our entry in the chinese market and the commencement of our advanced resource recovery project that will help secure future raw material supply and control costs these all have the potential to impact our operating performance not just through the rest of the year but for years to come

5653484 die strecke ist eine herausforderung obwohl die hohen betonw nde ein ganz anderes gef hl vermitteln als andere strecken beispielsweise monaco
5653485 die erste kurve ist eine rechtskurve die in einem formel 1 rennwagen mit vollgas genommen wird dann muss vor kurve zwei einer im zweiten gang befahrenen rechtskurve stark abgebremst werden kurve drei wird genau wie die kurven f nf und sechs im vierten gang durchfahren die wagen werden wahrscheinlich im siebenten gang gefahren bevor sie vor kurve acht heruntergebremst werden dann kommt der br ckenabschnitt
5653486 es gibt eine kleine bodenwelle zu beginn und am ende der astilleros bridge und die wagen k nnten bei regen ausbrechen dann folgt eine 90 grad rechtskurve bevor es auf eine lange kurvige gerade geht langsamere wagen k nnten hier im qualifying ein problem darstellen man muss also beim hochbeschleunigen die streckenposten im auge behalten
5653487 vor kurve zw lf m ssen die wagen stark heruntergebremst werden an dieser stelle zeigt sich am meisten dass es sich um einen stra enkurs handelt da man ampeln und h user sehen kann es folgt eine doppelte linkskurve und direkt danach kurve 14 eine im vierten gang befahrene 90 grad kurve es folgt eine weitere lange gerade gefolgt von einer haarnadelkurve die der adelaide kurve in magny cours hnelt sie bietet eine gute berholm glichkeit
5653488 wir befinden uns jetzt in den letzten abschnitten der runde und es folgen einige schnelle weit ausholende kurven sie bringen uns zur letzten kurve einer ziemlich engen linkskurve die kurvenausfahrt ist wichtig da es auf die start und zielgerade geht wo eine neue runde beginnt
5653489 drew mik and myself can only apologise to those who came to see us today peter has missed the flight we are in salzburg with no peter we will head to the festival and apologise on stage adam
5653490 the women pulled back from me as if id said i eat babies
5653491 are those who know equal to those who know not
5653492 indeed for the aalim scholar everything in the heavens and the earth seek forgiveness for him and the fish in the sea and the virtue of an aalim over the servant is like the virtue of the moon on a full moon night over the rest of the heavenly bodies and the scholars are the inheritors of the prophets and indeed the prophets do not leave behind as inheritance dinaar nor dirhaam they leave behind as inheritance the knowledge so whoever takes from it then he has grasped an abundant fortune
5653493 whoever allaah wants for him good he gives him understanding of the deen
5653494 indeed the example of the scholars in the earth is like that of the stars in the sky one is guided by them in the darkness of the land and the sea
5653495 this group is stationery wherever the daleel evidence is stationery and they move with the daleel wherever the daleel moves once there is evidence they adhere to it and take it and they go to it collectively and individually
5653496 the prophet once looked at the sky and he said
5653497 o messenger of allaah how is it that knowledge will be raised up and we have the book of allaah and we read it and we study it and we teach it to our children
5653498 i used to consider you one of the most knowledgeable people of ahlul madinah didnt the jews and christians have their book with them 5 should i not inform you of the first of the knowledge to be raised up
5653499 khushoo and the fear of allaah until you will not see a person having this type of humbleness in a state of fear in times to come
5653500 knowledge is of two types knowledge on the tongue is the evidence of allaah against the children of aadam as comes in the hadith
5653501 if a person really wants to be in this position carrying the responsibility of passing religious verdicts then he must be knowledgeable of the asaaneed
5653502 but the things that my lord has indeed forbidden are al faw hish great evil sins and every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse whether committed openly or secretly sins of all kinds unrighteous oppression joining partners in worship with all h for which he has given no authority and saying things about all h of which you have no knowledge
5653503 allaah does not take away knowledge by simply snatching it away but the knowledge is taken away by removing the people of knowledge until there is no scholar remaining and the people shall take as their leaders ignorant individuals and they will be questioned and they will give religious rulings and they shall go astray and lead other astray also
5653504 wouldnt it be lovely if the image of britain currently encapsulated by boozy and chemical hedonism and being obsessed by making short term financial gains were replaced by the image of glorious world beating performances the resulting natural highs and a determination to be and stay brilliant shown by some of our olympians
5653505 the robust pre clinical data package for lt ns001 suggests that this novel compound will provide patients with a drug that combines the efficacy and cardiovascular safety of naproxen while substantially decreasing the risk for gastrointestinal ulceration
5653506 the results from our recently completed p1b study of lt ns001 are very encouraging because they show that administration of the pro drug leads to clinically useful circulating levels of naproxen
5653507 continue the trial unmodified until the next scheduled or triggered meeting

5653523 but i havent been so happy with an amp as i have with my ad30 which ive used for everything ever since i first got it about four years ago theres something about that amp i can mess with it and really change the sound and the gain structure of it but i can do so really simply
5653524 in my extensive collection of about fifteen amps ive got a 1950s and a 1960s fender twin an ampeg reverb a 1950s fender tweed and some old ac30s but the ad30 can produce all of those vintage sounds partly because i can drive it without going incredibly loud
5653525 i have lots of acoustics and electrics one of my main stage electrics is a 1964 fender jazzmaster and for acoustic i use a brook homemade guitar see photo left by a company from dartmoor but when we recorded the rip i used a beautiful little kids guitar that i bought in a junk shop for four quid it had just the kind of different tone id been after for a quite a while it cost another thirty pounds to have the frets sorted out and then i used it in the studio recorded with a three and a half grand mic laughs my first perception of acoustic guitars was from records and on records they never sound like they do when youre in the room they sound more spacious and have much more frequency so for me to play a kids guitar means its got limited frequency range already when recording so it gives space for loads of other stuff
5653526 i studied jazz for more than ten years but ive always been interested in further sounds you can get from guitars either by using pedals or by alternative ways of playing for instance playing rhythms behind the bridge with a paint brush and using effects on that sound or bowing the strings with a pair of long nose pliers in these kinds of ways you can make the guitar go into other worlds which wouldnt happen playing in the conventional way and my pedals are pretty extreme i have an american real mccoy wah pedal i used to use a cry baby with the rmc i can get pure wah sound which i love or extreme filter sweeping and volume change ive got fuzz boxes that were custom made for me that give out a really extreme germanium kind of fuzz and ive got a hot cake distortion pedal from new zealand ive got a lot of different echo pedals set up on my board including a line 6 an old boss analogue and newish boss digital echo and a tremolo that can go from extreme to really subtle the thing with all of this is that im looking for texture or extremity
5653527 i wanted to have a loud speaker cab thats two separate words laughs and so i asked jim barr who plays bass with us to spray paint a design on the speaker grille i really like what he came up with and in a weird kind of way it fits in with the pictures you get on old orange amps the mountains for the echo and stuff
5653528 i did it with masking tape and a can of spray paint and i used my imagination a little bit and wanted something to look like a picture of loudness i could waffle on about all kinds of arty stuff like german expressionism bit i wont laughs we sprayed the whole grille black then put on the masking tape and sprayed over with matt white car primer it took about twenty minutes all in all
5653529 ive never used a 4 12 before in my life and what i found was that i could make it feed back in a more controlled way which was really good
5653530 i remember orange from the 1970s when i was beginning quite a few friends had them but those old 120 watt ones were way too loud for me then a few years ago i was doing a session for marianne faithfull which polly harvey was producing and she had an ad30 with a 2 12 cab and i used hers in the studio it was so totally brilliant and not just for guitar we played bass through it for certain things and that also sounded great
5653531 the damages and costs ordered by the court are significant and should act as a deterrent
5653532 illegal file sharing is a very serious issue resulting in millions of pounds of losses to copyright owners
5653533 the damages and costs ordered by the court are significant and should act as a deterrent this shows that taking direct steps against infringers is an important and effective weapon in the battle against online piracy

5653541 our previous studies showed that soft landing can be used to prepare ultrapure peptide layers on substrates the question we faced was in addition to controlling purity can we also control the structure of the molecules we showed we could
5653542 because we were starting from something that wasnt helical in solution we were a little pessimistic whether it would work at all
5653543 we found an interesting pathway to conduct different types of chemical reactions between complex molecules and substrates that will potentially enable us to prepare materials that cannot be made by standard methods
5653544 we hope to conduct lots of chemistry on the thin films
5653545 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5653546 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5653547 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
5653548 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5653549 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells
5653550 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution

5653571 weve been banging on about it for a few years now and the international market is certainly picking up on it lonely planet put some of its spies into the marketplace and came across some of our really great and unique little maori operations scattered around the country and theyve certainly got appeal
5653572 well what i was excited about when i heard the wellington tenths leadership speak is that they actually wanted to do very practical things quite apart from property management they want to see more of their people housed they want to do partnerships with the government they want to see more of the land and resources they are going to get back turned not only into commercial development but as homes and residences for both young and old
5653573 the preparation of a maara reaches to the core values of our culture particularly where kai is concerned the basis of traditional food preparation is centered around a celebration of kai

5653575 this particular whale when we found out it was a very rare one the status of that particular tohora became quite clear to us and quite important to us we looked at that and felt that this tohora was great promise it looked like it could be changing times ahead not just for ngati hei but also hauraki and maybe even maoridom

5653578 we zijn al verder in onze voorbereidingen dan dat we waren met de vorige edities bij die voorbereidingen was het vinden van sponsors een uiterst moeilijke aangelegenheid nu gaat dat een stuk soepeler
5653579 wij proberen deze keer sail meer dynamiek te geven meer activiteiten op het water we willen ook meer zeil zien in plaats van boten zonder zeil het moet weer een zeiltechnisch evenement worden met meer spektakel dat kan bijvoorbeeld in de vorm van entertainment zoals bemanningsleden die een show geven kortom de schepen hoeven niet langer statisch te liggen maar er moet ook wat te zien zijn
5653580 ik vind dat sail verder moet voortborduren op de activiteiten die we in 2005 georganiseerd hebben zoals een kinderpersconferentie met voorafgaand een training van atv en de telegraaf hiermee maken kinderen op een leuke manier kennis met ons maritiem verleden
5653581 tot nu toe heeft het nautisch evenementenbureau alle hospitalityvaarten gerealiseerd dit verloopt altijd allemaal prima maar wat ik jammer vind is dat er nog veel meer aan hospitality wordt gedaan waar stichting sail te weinig bij betrokken is zo zijn er ontzettend veel bedrijven aan het water gevestigd tussen ijmuiden en amsterdam die er zelf een feestje van maken ze zetten hun ramen open plaatsen tenten op de kade en ontvangen daar hun gasten het zou leuker zijn als deze activiteiten ge ntegreerd worden met de activiteiten van sail al is het in de vorm van banners en vlaggen zodat we n uitstraling hebben en de mensen op de schepen in een sail omgeving binnenvaren
5653582 de vergunningenaanvragen en wat daar mee samenhangt is een langdurig en diepgaand proces er vindt veelvuldig overleg plaats binnen de amsterdamse gemeente de havenautoriteiten havenbeheer enzovoorts
5653583 in zijn algemeenheid kun je zeggen dat sail amsterdam bijzonder leeft en iedereen sail een warm hart toedraagt ook de gemeente en alle instanties ik ga er vanuit dat het allemaal goed gaat
5653584 wat is belangrijker een lekker broodje of een charismatische spreker
5653585 in the dressing room he is always the same cheerful
5653586 its a big big two weeks for us the key is we get other players in and improve the team as we go along the market is loosening up and im hoping that players who might not have been available will now become available
5653587 the balance of the team isnt quite right at the moment and we also need players with premiership experience
5653588 ecb chief executive david collier was at the meeting and he will report back
5653589 they have a board meeting in london on tuesday to discuss the issue
5653590 the meeting with icc chief executive haroon lorgat lasted two hours and it was an opportunity for all the players to ask whatever questions they had about the tournament
5653591 david collier and hugh morris managing director of the england team were both there and they heard the views of all the players
5653592 in the past i always felt that the team was picked before we met up
5653593 but i dont think there are any automatic choices in the team any more and it doesnt matter who you play for if you are good enough you will get in fabio capello is very fair and you get the feeling that if you play well you will get in the team
5653594 its a very professional set up when you are with the squad and that is the way it should be i wouldnt say its frightening its an atmosphere of respect
5653595 its not like a boarding school its enjoyable and the coach will have banter with you
5653596 andy comes to us with considerable premier league experience for a player of his age
5653597 in the past i always felt that the team was picked before we met up
5653598 but i dont think there are any automatic choices in the team any more and it doesnt matter who you play for if you are good enough you will get in fabio capello is very fair and you get the feeling that if you play well you will get in the team
5653599 its a very professional set up when you are with the squad and that is the way it should be i wouldnt say its frightening its an atmosphere of respect
5653600 its not like a boarding school its enjoyable and the coach will have banter with you
5653601 this was always a game which people would look forward to and it should be a good game
5653602 we got a point the last time we played chelsea and im looking forward to playing against them again who knows we might get all three this time

5653604 ive been installing some of the latest linux releases for the past week to better understand whats available
5653605 it would be easy to give in and let inflation get out of control thats what happened in the 1970s but it would be damaging and dangerous to the economy
5653606 dont expect food and energy prices to rise forever all being well inflation will fall again next year and will be much closer to the 2 target by the end of 2009
5653607 but that will only happen if people dont chase inflationary wage increases
5653608 everyone wants to protect their living standard but if everyone does it prices will just go up again as businesses try to cover their higher costs
5653609 then well all be back to square one but with inflation still high
5653610 it just feels unbelievable its going to take a while to sink in but wow
5653611 i think that if the winds here had been a little bit stronger and the racing had been normal then i would have just sailed my race because i would have been more confident that i wasnt going to lose
5653612 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation
5653613 the uk economy urgently needs an interest rate cut to counter threats of recession

5653622 this is our game in hand effectively and if we win that we would be level with denmark and two points behind finland
5653623 but all we need to do is win the next game
5653624 finland won their first five games and are in a great position
5653625 to finish top we need them to drop points but theres still a lot to play for and the important thing for us is to win our next game
5653626 ce matin nous avons tendu une embuscade aux troupes de lotan dans le district de saroubi laide de mines et de roquettes nous avons d truit cinq v hicules et inflig de lourdes pertes

5653632 ferrari has the ability and resources to work on next years car without having to relax for one moment on continuing the development of the f2008 in a championship that is proving to be very tight between ourselves and our usual opponents
5653633 we are now in a delicate phase of the season with no way to recover from any mistakes one step in the wrong direction could prove very costly
5653634 at the risk of repeating ourselves our aim is the same as ever to ensure that every element of our package and team works to its maximum as we strive to bring home as many points as possible and hopefully be the first to put our names on a valencia trophy
5653635 the track looks very interesting combining a variety of different corner types as well as some sections with a high top speed maybe slightly lower than those seen at the montreal circuit in canada
5653636 we can expect high temperatures this weekend which should not present us with any problems
5653637 weve been calling on people to do it for themselves do it voluntarily do it for the country do it to stop climate change do it to save money do it to make our roads safer
5653638 cios have to align it with their corporate strategy to get higher returns
5653639 a hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor and today that new world is struggling to be born a world quite different from the one weve known a world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle a world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice a world where the strong respect the rights of the weak

5653644 if you think can or you think you cant youre probably right
5653645 come on ive done all the studying i can do this
5653646 your life today is the result of your attitudes and choices in the past your life tomorrow will be the result of your attitudes and the choices you make today
5653647 the process for us is to try and improve to be as good as we can and i think weve achieved that
5653648 there has been gradual progress over the course of the summer with the goal to peak in beijing i think weve played our best volleyball here but weve got to get better every day
5653649 this is a real testament to the amount of work weve put in over the last four years
5653650 its a good time for it to start paying off were playing our best volleyball right now
5653651 i know hugh and wiz are strong people hes doing what he came here to do and hes doing the best he can well keep fighting for him and for the result we trained and worked for
5653652 for our organization for our team for usa volleyball it would be wonderful if we were able to win
5653653 it doesnt change what happened but it would be a nice achievement for these guys who worked so hard the last few years

5653656 following the heathrow terminal 5 embarrassment the last thing this country needs is another major transport hub grinding to a halt
5653657 its incredibly important that these incidents are not beyond the law it certainly would be a step in the right direction if the us would go ahead and bring charges
5653658 this is definitely the most high profile case of contractor abuse in iraq but its certainly not the only one
5653659 if it is determined that an individual acted improperly blackwater would support holding that person accountable but at this stage without being able to review evidence collected in an ongoing investigation we will not prejudge the actions of any individual
5653660 chaque ann e une soixantaine de nouvelles s ries d barquent sur les crans am ricains et pour la plupart dentre elles trouver un public sav re mission impossible
5653661 it is invaluable to have an independent monitor who can swiftly question any adverse drug reactions or differences in illness and death rates between groups taking part in the clinical trials
5653662 parents also need to be made aware of the risks of adverse drug reactions when a child takes any medicine so that they can make informed decisions that balance those risks against the possible benefits the drug may provide their child
5653663 there is general agreement by pediatric health professionals regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry as well as politicians and parents that are essential in order to improve drug therapies
5653664 we are calling for all pediatric drug trials to include independent safety monitoring committees to ensure that this vital work is carried out in a way that minimizes risks and maximizes benefits for the children taking part
5653665 we need to test drugs on children as the only other options are to use unlicensed drugs or prescribe drugs that have been licensed for adults
5653666 but we feel that the small number of studies that reported having safety monitoring committees was unacceptable
5653667 oh dont you remember me i was standing outside the dalai lamas in delhi
5653668 um i was there to you know get some maps and uh some postcards
5653669 assessing the condition of oil related infrastructure cleaning up oil spills or other environmental damage at oil facilities engineering design and repair or reconstruction of damaged infrastructure assisting in making facilities operational distribution of petroleum products and assisting the iraqis in resuming iraqi oil company operations
5653670 the fact that the department was planning for the possibility that it would need to repair and provide for continuity of operations of the iraqi oil infrastructure was classified until march 2003
5653671 this prevented earlier acknowledgement or announcement of potential requirements to the business community
5653672 contingent on informing wh white house tomorrow we anticipate no issues since action has been coordinated w vps vice presidents office
5653673 the most blatant and improper contract abuse i have witnessed during the course of my professional career
5653674 the u s considered such contingency planning necessary because of saddam husseins actions in kuwait in 1991 when iraqi forces damaged 750 wells
5653675 that destruction resulted in an environmental disaster as well as a tremendous blow to kuwaits oil production capability
5653676 from behind the obsidian mirrors of his wraparound sunglasses ray rodon surveys the vast desert landscape of southern iraqs rumailah oilfield a project manager with halliburtons engineering and construction division kellogg brown amp root rodon has spent months preparing for the daunting task of repairing iraqs oil industry working first at headquarters in houston and then out of a hotel room in kuwait city he has studied the intricacies of the iraqi national oil company even reviewing the firms organizational charts so that halliburton and the army can ascertain which iraqis are reliable technocrats and which are saddam loyalists
5653677 rodon represents the vanguard of what is expected to be a growing army of halliburton employees in iraq where the u s is preparing to embark on the grandest exercise in nation building since its occupation of japan after world war ii at the center of that undertaking will be u s companies with halliburton probably chief among them
5653678 indeed texans wearing kbr baseball caps are arriving by the planeload at kuwaits airport
5653679 the liberation of iraq couldnt come at a better time for halliburton whose business has been dogged by a host of troubles from a slowdown in domestic oil production to nightmare asbestos litigation last year revenues declined 6 to 12 6 billion and the company reported a net loss of 984 million but ceo dave lesar who took over when his predecessor dick cheney went to washington is starting to put halliburtons problems behind it he has cut costs sold unproductive assets curtailed money losing overseas operations and devised a bold plan to settle asbestos related lawsuits
5653680 the dod through its us army logistics civil augmentation program logcap iii contract with kbr tapped the company in november 2002 to develop the contingency plan implementation of the plan is being executed through a separate contract kellogg brown amp root now holds with the us army corps of engineers
5653681 kbr was selected for the iraq contract based on the fact that kbr is the only contractor that could commence implementing the complex contingency plan on extremely short notice
5653682 we made the contract broad enough so we could handle issues just like this
5653683 i have always insisted that our desire is to make our state a destination for learning and capacity building a place where students and teachers will be happy to learn and work
5653684 we were telling each other lets go out and make history lets go out and get this sweep
5653685 i felt like we were the best three in the world
5653686 i came to the birds nest to lay a golden egg and thats what i did
5653687 the usa hasnt really had a great showing so far and we wanted to uplift the track team with the sweep
5653688 id actually pay to buy a ticket for that one
5653689 david robinson and karl malone and that was the frontcourt
5653690 who else was up there patrick ewing so patrick david and karl malone that would be interesting
5653691 the world is embracing the sport that the dream teamers brought to barcelona
5653692 and i would say the 2008 olympics really demonstrate that complete embrace
5653693 you know i didnt even dare to think about that
5653694 the question was one step at a time if youve been along on the journey sometimes you dont realize how far youve come
5653695 that would be a separate league that would be nba affiliated or nba sponsored but it would be independent
5653696 and it would just sign players for a very long time to come it would be at a lower scale than the nba but as the sport develops in china and as more players around the world recognize the opportunities of playing in china we see that league growing and strengthening
5653697 i think that that is likely to become a regular thing
5653698 coming out of athens there was just more of a focus at every level on the game and the representation of ones country and were just doing a better job collectively on that front
5653699 i think that i would encourage usa basketball and the nba players to focus upon longer than bringing a group together
5653700 i think that commitment is not just about the teamwork but also about the international discipline that comes from basketball diplomacy and our players are learning their lessons well
5653701 i felt comfortable i just really wanted to win the heat
5653702 its a shame a final should be with the best ones
5653703 its good for the runners not so good for the jumpers
5653704 i had to adjust and once i did i pulled out a big one
5653705 i just want to jump my best and try to break my pb well see how far that takes me
5653706 theres so many people concerned about me and who support me i feel very sorry but theres really nothing i could do
5653707 i didnt feel right when i was warming up before the race
5653708 i knew my foot would fail me i felt painful when i was just jogging
5653709 i wanted to hang on but i couldnt it was unbearable if i had finished the race i would have risked my tendon i could not describe my feeling at that moment
5653710 i know i have the ability once my foot recovered
5653711 now the most important thing is to heal my injury i still have a chance next year after all im still at the peak i must be optimistic and i shouldnt blame everyone and everything but not myself i will not easily give up
5653712 we all understand that liu quit the race due to injury
5653713 we hope he will relax and focus on recovery we hope that after he recovers he will continue to train hard and struggle harder for the national glory
5653714 love the glory love the pain love sport even when it breaks your heart
5653715 hes chinas young hero and the hopes of the people rest on his shoulders
5653716 as i watched this terrible turn of events on my television i was tremendously shocked and saddened
5653717 my heart went out to liu xiang for his disappointment i hope he will feel everyones love and support during this difficult time
5653718 i think were going to all enjoy a nice summer day
5653719 after going through charley this doesnt seem nothing more than a gust of wind
5653720 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5653721 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous

5653726 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5653727 i think you can expect a strong message to russia
5653728 decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era

5653736 the number of penalties will decrease and the quality of care will dramatically improve as hospitals take action to improve
5653737 the entire intent of these fines is to improve the overall quality of care in california
5653738 i am the pro of the hospital the other nurses call me to put in ivs that they cannot get in
5653739 kids are going to drink whether its legal or illegal
5653740 wed at least be able to have a more open dialogue with students about drinking as opposed to this sham where people dont want to talk about it because its a violation of the law
5653741 how many times must we relearn the lessons of prohibition
5653742 adults under 21 are deemed capable of voting signing contracts serving on juries and enlisting in the military but are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5653743 we have this law that in effect prevents any state from exploring new ways of addressing the issue
5653744 we have a crisis on our hands we need some new ideas and new thinking
5653745 drunk driving used to be a part of american culture until someone stood up and said we need to make a change and 25 years later designated driver is a commonplace term in every household in america
5653746 it gives me great pause to think of sending thousands of students onto a campus where the person who is most accountable doesnt seem to be devoted to ensuring their health and safety
5653747 if they drink too much in the beginning of an evening they can get alcohol poisoning
5653748 theyre really not aware of how their judgment is impaired we hope they dont get into a car or if theyre a young woman go to a fraternity party its just not healthy
5653749 a lot of young people feel that they are afraid of enforcement
5653750 they tend to get in a car and go someplace else and thats very very dangerous i worry about it every weekend
5653751 i think alcohol is seen a lot of times as a forbidden thing and people want it
5653752 its almost like contraband once you get it you have to drink all of it
5653753 maybe im being idealistic but in europe you can drink once you can see the bar
5653754 i think we should maybe take a lesson from what other countries are doing
5653755 lets debate the age and look at the pros and cons
5653756 i really think weve got to somehow be able to control it better because what we have done now is driven it underground and we cant do anything about it
5653757 there are a lot of things we could do if it wasnt underground
5653758 just as soon as i got excited about it i thought that anything as fun cool as this must be illegal

5653781 what we dont know is how much money this really saves if saving money is your goal

5653785 we will do whatever is necessary and no one should have any illusion
5653786 nobody is planning to withdraw the russian contingent very swiftly as there is no such necessity
5653787 by being able to silence certain genes we may be able to suppress genes that can cause diseases such as hiv aids cancer inflammation and diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems we now know we can focus on these genes and potentially change the ultimate course of many diseases that have a major impact on peoples lives
5653788 we believe that the obsession with idealized beauty and body image is a lifelong burden that takes a terrible toll on all young girls and women in this country
5653789 whats really new here is the sheer extent to which women and girls are now willing to go literally causing physical harm to be beautiful according to the standards perpetuated by a youth obsessed media culture with literally thousands of messages 24 hours a day
5653790 darryls amazing documentary provides an important medium for our message and we hope to reach a wide audience through this important partnership
5653791 the ywca has been at the forefront of womens issues in this country for the past 150 years and we are prepared to raise awareness and ignite a national dialogue about this issue as the first steps to changing american culture and helping women reclaim wholesome and healthy beauty
5653792 it is important that people with epilepsy and their caregivers take steps to prevent these tragedies
5653793 people with active epilepsy should shower instead of bathe take medication regularly to control seizures and should have direct supervision when swimming
5653794 because the compilation mixes diverse studies of several drugs and the number of cancers observed during controlled hypnotics trials remains small
5653795 this preliminary analysis should be viewed as an investigative step rather than sufficient proof that modern hypnotics cause cancer
5653796 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
5653797 the agreement signed between the unrwa and the refugee camps states resuming distribution of aid portions for refugees three times a year as follows families with 1 3 members get one portion 4 6 members get two portions and 7 members above get two portions plus 200 shekels

5653802 the bottom line is that u s families raising children with disabilities are reporting severe hardships at rates that are chilling including families that are solidly middle class
5653803 we were shocked to find such high rates of hardship among upper income families
5653804 these results suggest that state and federal policies that are in place to help families with disabled children are not going nearly far enough
5653805 they are not eliminating deprivation and these findings are particularly troubling now when the nations economy is struggling families raising children with disabilities are likely to be hardest hit during this economic downturn
5653806 these families struggle to provide adequate care for their disabled children
5653807 in simple terms school refusal is absenteeism where children complain of physical symptoms or express fear about going to school
5653808 its different from truancy because these kids generally stay home with their parents knowledge
5653809 the longer a child suffers from school refusal behavior and is allowed to stay home the more difficult it is to return to school
5653810 its important to seek solutions and get them quickly back on the right track
5653811 with nearly 70 percent of the states infected mosquitoes here in the southeast region were taking coordinated action to reduce this threat
5653812 in order to protect the public dep is temporarily reassigning certified pesticide applicators from other parts of the state so that we can be more aggressive in our treatment efforts
5653813 for families with about 1 500 in annual medical expenses an hsa can often save them more than 6 000 a year
5653814 about 25 percent of my patients have ragweed allergy and i make sure they are well prepared for peak pollen season
5653815 since allergic rhinitis also known as hay fever can quickly develop into other complications such as ear infections sinusitis recurrent sore throats cough and headache its important that ragweed allergy is treated and well controlled studies show it also can cause altered sleep patterns fatigue irritability and poor school performance accurate allergy diagnosis and proper treatment can eliminate or alleviate most of these problems
5653816 there is little risk of the economy falling into a major downturn
5653817 sluggish against the backdrop of high energy and materials prices and weaker growth in exports
5653818 we need to be mindful of both upside and downside risks
5653819 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
5653820 the take home lesson is that platelets by releasing pf4 are playing an early role in the wind up phase of cerebral malaria
5653821 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them a big challenge in translating this to humans is that people dont know when they get infected
5653822 platelets dont get any respect but theyre the second most abundant cell in the blood after red blood cells and packed full of factors that rally the immune system to action by taking what we know about platelets and their activation and applying it to malaria we have found a driver of cerebral malaria
5653823 when you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children it is obvious there are variations
5653824 currently autism diagnosis is purely behaviour based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities
5653825 we are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
5653826 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5653827 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons
5653828 using the 3 d representations we are comparing the brain structures of autistic children to those of non autistic children no one has ever done that
5653829 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
5653830 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them a big challenge in translating this to humans is that people dont know when they get infected
5653831 only in recent years has there been a substantial effort to manufacture child friendly formulations of first line tuberculosis drugs such as crushable mini pills granules oral suspensions
5653832 and in the past 15 years children have been included in only one study of new agents for tuberculosis a large phase 3 trial evaluating once weekly rifapentine isoniazid for treatment of latent tuberculosis
5653833 children have the same right to benefit from research as do adults while this lack of involvement may be understandable in the short term it is not acceptable in the long term
5653834 these condition are expected to lead to higher levels of virus activity and greater exposure of humans to the viruses news com au quoted prof dunstan as saying
5653835 by being able to silence certain genes we may be able to suppress genes that can cause diseases such as hiv aids cancer inflammation and diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems we now know we can focus on these genes and potentially change the ultimate course of many diseases that have a major impact on peoples lives
5653836 the problem in applying stereotype threat to uk medical students is that the majority of ethnic minority medical students here are from south asian backgrounds and it is not fully clear whether negative stereotypes exist about that group
5653837 the aim of the study was to establish if negative stereotypes about that group do exist and thus if stereotype threat might be one reason that uk ethnic minority medical students are underperforming academically
5653838 the fact that these negative stereotypes exist raises the possibility that stereotype threat may be occurring
5653839 its clear from our results that more research needs to be done into the effects of stereotype threat in uk medical schools and in fostering positive educational relationships between all students and their clinical teachers

5653844 the war within a secret white house history 2006 2008
5653845 there has not been such an authoritative and intimate account of presidential decision making since the nixon tapes and the pentagon papers
5653846 this is the declassification of what went on in secret behind the scenes
5653847 takes readers deep inside the white house the pentagon the state department the intelligence agencies and the u s military headquarters in iraq
5653848 based on extensive interviews with participants contemporaneous notes and secret documents the book traces the internal debates tensions and critical turning points in the iraq war during an extraordinary two year period
5653849 doesnt need to be extremely reptilian only more reptilian than his opponent is
5653850 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
5653851 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
5653852 ted strickland has no room to criticize anyone for lacking an economic plan
5653853 hes done nothing to turn around ohios economy and now hes embracing a presidential candidate whose only solution is to raise taxes on everything from senior citizens to natural gas if barack obama does for the nation what ted strickland has done to ohio these last two years the only thing turning around in our economy will be the jobs leaving our state
5653854 he acknowledged that obama is connecting with voters but pointed to the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections when some voters said they backed george w
5653855 we ended up with george w bush and i think thats been disastrous for the country
5653856 ohio gov ted strickland a clinton backer says shell win the buckeye state i dont think ohio is going to be taken in by the fluff strickland told the news in cincinnati i think its a choice between a speech and a plan he said

5653858 senator obama is spending a lot of money on tv if this can be purchased he can win it gov
5653859 instead of waiting until risky alcohol and other drug use become a major issue the guideline promotes an open discussion between doctor and patient empowering patients to take charge of their health
5653860 we hope that a sbirt screening will become as common as a blood pressure check at your annual doctors appointment
5653861 as with all our guidelines the guideline for alcohol and substance use presents essential information in a user friendly format that can be used by any healthcare professional
5653862 and beyond the systematic approach to screen patients the new guideline provides recommendations for management based on the patients risk level
5653863 people thought gee is this pat robertson and jerry falwell
5653864 there are millions of americans across this country for whom faith is important
5653865 and whether they vote on the basis of their faith or whether they vote about issues that are somehow connected to their faith we should be reaching out to them
5653866 there are shades and gradations of what it means to be a democrat
5653867 were not all los angeles new york birkenstock wearing democrats
5653868 the top issues are no longer just abortion and gay marriage
5653869 people thought gee is this pat robertson and jerry falwell
5653870 we want people of faith to know that barack obama is a viable option and a candidate whos not ashamed to stand up and talk about his values
5653871 democrats have developed a keen awareness of the problem and theyre seriously engaged in trying to narrow the gap
5653872 that in itself is a significant change from 2000 and 2004
5653873 der bedarf von schulkindern bis 14 jahre wird mittlerweile mit dem von s uglingen gleichgesetzt
5653874 its the start of a change in tactics in dealing with crowd control and dispersing violent demonstrations and violent instances
5653875 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
5653876 that the obama campaign has chosen to portray me as a 9 11 truther just shows how sloppy and inaccurate the research going into their rebuttal was
5653877 let me make clear that i fully accept and endorse the conclusion of the 9 11 commission that the islamic hijackers who flew the airplanes into the world trade center and the pentagon were the sole cause of the attack
5653878 there is no credible evidence that the u s government had any responsibility in the attack and it is irresponsible to suggest otherwise
5653879 after the review of my draft article by the wnd editorial staff i agreed the piece should be withdrawn
5653880 as i explained on the radio i am typically interested in scientific evidence that lies outside the explanation of conventional hypotheses
5653881 science advances by rejecting hypotheses not by establishing hypotheses in other words should somebody find convincing scientific evidence that challenges some aspect of any official report that evidence will not automatically confirm the truth of an alternative hypothesis
5653882 put simply even if we had published the article all we would have established was that there were some questions yet to be resolved with the governments 9 11 explanation not that an alternative hypothesis was suddenly correct
5653883 a video clip widely circulated on the internet shows a test that pulverized an f 4 fighter on impact with a hardened target providing evidence to answer 9 11 skeptics who question why so little identifiable airplane debris remained after the hijacked american airlines boeing 757 hit the pentagon
5653884 after i published that piece i got a lot of angry mail from 9 11 truth advocates who were upset that i was not agreeing with them
5653885 i go on many different types of radio shows but that doesnt mean i agree with the host or the program on the issues the host supports
5653886 i want to reach the audiences with my message im not on radio shows to endorse or deliver somebody elses message
5653887 and if it does do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it or do we defeat it
5653888 erase evil from the world that is gods task but we can be soldiers in that process and we can confront evil when we see it
5653889 abide by that basic precept in the book of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5653890 weve had a president who is opposed to abortions over the last eight years and abortions have not gone down
5653891 taken to the soiled utility room and left alone to die
5653892 a lot of evil has been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil
5653893 just because we think our intentions are good doesnt always mean that were going to be doing good

5653919 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia
5653920 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5653921 welcome to mccainpalin com the best source for information on the john mccain sarah palin 2008 republican presidential ticket stay tuned for important announcements
5653922 her rise is a great and rare story of how adherence to principle especially to transparency and accountability in government can produce political success
5653923 it has been up for a while and used to be a fully functional webpage with newsfeeds bios etc however the stay tuned message is new
5653924 for clinicians the message from our study is that a lack of energy is widespread in the elderly but it s not normal
5653925 children who consumed two or more servings of dairy and four ounces of meat or other non dairy protein had bone mineral contents over 300 grams higher than those children with lower intakes of both dairy and other proteins
5653926 dairy is a key source of proteins calcium and other micronutrients including phosphorus and vitamin d
5653927 the more you smoke the more likely you are to have a stroke
5653928 certainly quitting is the best thing you could do but cutting back does offer some benefit
5653929 the 3m redevelopment of the site has guaranteed its long term operation in the coleraine area by incorporating new state of the art equipment and machinery
5653930 materials quarried at the macosquin site will be used in the construction of roads and other major construction and civil engineering projects in the region
5653931 we believe the investment we have made in the site at macosquin clearly demonstrates our faith in and commitment to the local economy
5653932 it is buttressing the regions economic prosperity in terms of employment opportunities created and materials being sought from local companies
5653933 ce matin nous avons tendu une embuscade aux troupes de lotan dans le district de saroubi laide de mines et de roquettes nous avons d truit cinq v hicules et inflig de lourdes pertes
5653934 lotan a ripost par des frappes a riennes aux cours desquelles cinq talibans et 15 civils ont t tu s
5653935 super easy to install takes just a couple lines of code and it works from inside your system
5653936 we work with the companies give them the first 100 000 monthly impressions for free then use a revenue share model
5653937 we want to make every site on the planet social
5653938 today if you ask someone to name a social site all they come up with is facebook and myspace we want every site to be socially powered
5653939 how crafty the smaller publishers are and how quick they are
5653940 the decommissioning and demolition of the site is very complex we are dealing with some very old structures
5653941 one of the chimneys was built in 1958 and we need detailed information on its current state to ascertain the most appropriate method to demolish it ensuring both health and safety and environmental standards are maintained
5653942 many people envisage demolition as a crane with a wrecking ball this wont be happening here many of the structures will be dismantled piece by piece in a controlled process
5653943 but the chimneys do present a special challenge the two newer stacks may be brought down using state of the art explosive techniques meaning they could come down in sections
5653944 however we may have to take down parts of one of the chimney in the same way it was put up 50 years ago brick by brick
5653945 the whole area is going to be opening up to regeneration new houses new businesses and jobs
5653946 the defendants contaminated the u s rice supply with non approved genetically modified strains of rice thereby affecting the market price for plaintiffs crops
5653947 designed to be resistant to a bayer herbicide liberty link
5653948 is now deregulated by usda but at the time of the contamination it was not approved for human consumption
5653949 the plaintiffs in the master consolidated class action complaint are rice producers from five u s states where rice is grown and harvested arkansas louisiana mississippi missouri and texas
5653950 inappropriate because plaintiffs varying claims for damages are not amenable to class wide adjudication
5653951 the u s market price for rice dropped dramatically as a result of bayers contamination of the rice supply
5653952 other rice buyers may set prices without reference to the cbot price at all some buyers correlate their prices with the world market price a price set by the usda and used in the calculation of farm subsidies unlike the cbot which changes every day the world market price changes once a week and does not reference the cbot some buyers purchase rice based on the world market price but with an adjusted basis other buyers such as cargill may offer a flat price for purchasing rice or may negotiate a price with a particular producer on an individual basis at the time of sale
5653953 determine a total monetary cost the market loss caused by defendants conduct
5653954 total quantity of u s rice affected by the contamination
5653955 plaintiffs have failed to show that common issues predominate over individual concerns about damages
5653956 a class action is not the superior mechanism by which to resolve plaintiffs claims
5653957 not persuaded that the calculation of damages in this case is a common issue
5653958 convenient shorthand calculation that might represent an estimate of some damages for some plaintiffs
5653959 calculation of actual damage is an individual issue specific to each plaintiff in this case involving unique inquiry into the time place and manner in which each plaintiff both priced and sold his rice
5653960 class certification may not be suitable where the calculation of damages is not susceptible to a mathematical or formulaic calculation or where the formula by which the parties propose to calculate damages is clearly inadequate
5653961 akin to a mass accident tort the sort of case that the advisory notes to rule 23 say should rarely be afforded class treatment
5653962 would do little if anything to increase the efficiency of this litigation
5653963 i am weary with my sighing every night i make my bed swim i dissolve my couch with my tears
5653964 just being able to sit in here and hang out with these guys its cool to sit in here
5653965 i told him i was going to do the 100 meter medley next year
5653966 once this comes to an end it will never happen again
5653967 whoa whoa whoa hold on can you swim can you swim
5653968 annnyyywayyyy annnyyyonnne who tries to predict this game of baseball is just cant be done it just cant be done theeeee pitch its called ball four no its called strike two annnyywayyy heres my little companera suzyn waldman with an amaaazzzzing insight into this game of baseball
5653969 you know john if robinson canoe knew what was causing his slump he would stop doing it
5653970 annyyywayy thanks for that amazzzzinnggg insight suzyn is there anything else to say
5653971 yes you cant win ballgames if you dont score runs
5653972 that is sooooo true suzyn sooo true isnt that amazzzinnnnggg isnt that ammmazzzingggg
5653973 you know my little companera its been said that if we quit tomorrow that there would be 72 hours of non stop partying in the streets by yankee fans isnt that ammazzzinnnggg isnt that ammazzzinnnggg
5653974 yes john that would be amazing you know what else john you cant get a hit if you dont swing the bat
5653975 thank you for that incredible insight from my little companera suzyn waldman that is ammazzinnggg that is ammazzinnggg
5653976 theeeee pitch it is high it is far it is gone no it bounces off the left field wall and it relayed into the infield you know i wasnt watching the monitor and the view here from the lowes broadcast booth is very poor you cant see the ball isnt that ammazzinnggg
5653977 if you put this in the class of wedding receptions gone bad i guess this would take the cake
5653978 andy got angry and started yelling what are you doing

5653995 even though its a public road you just cant do whatever you want on public property
5653996 its regrettable that we had to go to court to settle this matter
5653997 the excessive truck traffic from the quarry was jeopardizing the health and safety of our citizens as well as disturbing the peace in our community we were confident that the well being of our citizens would take precedence over a truck route and the jury agreed
5653998 we are surprised by the verdict the jury reached in this case
5653999 we do not believe the verdict is supported by the evidence that was presented
5654000 the trial was another chapter in an ongoing dispute between greenwood and our company over the use of a public street
5654001 we have no choice but to continue our fight for our right so we can continue to provide a vital product to our customers and the communities who need it on a daily basis
5654002 regrettably there are times when litigation is necessary in order to best defend the needs of our citizens in this case when no resolution was forthcoming we knew we had to move forward with a lawsuit to protect the health safety and well being of the citizens of greenwood i think the unanimous verdict shows we made the right decision
5654003 the unit could be a possible target for crhs products divisions in europe and the us as these already have clay product businesses
5654004 the trick is to get the bag to draw down correctly so that wrinkles dont develop in the individual layers of fabric which could affect the ultimate strength of the composite
5654005 this projects production went as if it were on steroids mfg took lessons learned from the first project and fabricated the beams more quickly and with better quality than before via their vacuum process
5654006 the test verifies the performance of the beams under the load criteria set forth by the project specifications the beams performed well during load testing passing the major criteria selected for the acoustic emission test in fact the beams stiffness tested better than expected substantiating their ability to sustain in service loads
5654007 the beams looked very nice with no visible flaws the method of fabrication resulted in a very good product
5654008 they delivered all the frp beams in one truck and handling and installation were easier using a small crane or large track hoe vs multiple cranes with steel or concrete options this means minimal equipment and people are required which equates to built in time and cost efficiencies on the project
5654009 in addition to the lightweight frp beams allowing for rapid onsite deployment its material strength over time will reduce maintenance costs on the overall construction of the bridge

5654011 ive never had a stylist pay so much attention to my complexion and bone structure
5654012 hey look at these reviews ill go n check it out
5654013 since he is a penang boy weve decided to have a cheque presentation in the state
5654014 nothing is what it seems people arent who you think they are dont trust anything and question everything
5654015 since we are old people we go on at 7 30pm
5654016 we successfully lured the calf about a kilometre out to sea probably the first time thats been done using a yacht as a surrogate mother
5654017 later we saw whales a bit further offshore and there was a slender chance it may have linked up with them but this morning we have got reports that it has returned to the western shores of pittwater
5654018 while its moving quite freely at the moment its condition would be expected to deteriorate over the next three days
5654019 weve consistently said it was a slim chance that it might link up with its mother or other whales but the reality is that in the wild for various reasons mothers sometimes reject their young
5654020 looking at its behaviour the way it was nuzzling up to yachts would indicate it was primarily still suckling
5654021 it really was trying to suckle just below the waterline and against the keel with its head engaged against the boat
5654022 when looking at the evidence against hammaad munshi i was satisfied there was enough for a case to go to court and that it was in the public interest despite his young age
5654023 the prosecution told the jury of his dedication to the cause of al qaeda and of discussions with aabid khan which included how he could travel abroad and smuggle a sword with him
5654024 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5654025 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5654026 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5654027 there was no way of hiking back there was no way of getting out
5654028 it was so negligent so badly handled not only by the villagers but also by whatever agency was there that i will never go back to that place

5654033 es ist aber noch viel zu fr h eine gesicherte aussage dar ber zu machen wie sich unsere installation auf die abschmelzrate ausgewirkt hat dazu m ssen erst die gesamten daten statistisch aufbereitet werden
5654034 obwohl das eis schnell zur ckging haben unsere verankerungen gehalten und wir k nnen den test wie geplant zu ende bringen
5654035 dort werden wir dann nach unserer r ckkehr mit der erstellung einer datenbank der analyse und interpretation beginnen
5654036 eine arbeitsgruppe film wird einen film ber unsere projektstudie erstellen und diesen dann auch universit tsintern ffentlich und im fernsehen pr sentieren
5654037 bis dahin ist gen gend zeit um alles fundiert auszuwerten und auch graphisch darzustellen und zu interpretieren
5654038 wir freuen uns ber diese unterst tzung zeigt sie doch auch dass unserem klimageographie projekt in der bev lkerung gro e bedeutung beigemessen wird und von der abschmelzung der gletscher alle betroffen sind
5654039 in den usa und australien werden seit jahren bereits str mungsmechanische untersuchungen im schwimmsport eingesetzt
5654040 in deutschland besteht hier noch ein gro er nachholbedarf in forschung und f rderung
5654041 solche str mungsberechnungen kennt man bereits von der aerodynamik von autos oder tragfl chen von flugzeugen doch dort sind die gegenst nde die man untersucht in den meisten f llen starr wir haben hier die aufgaben str mungen an sich stark verformenden geometrien zu berechnen
5654042 diese wirbel k nnen wie bei einer tragfl che eines flugzeugs einen auftrieb erzeugen
5654043 wir wissen aber auch von untersuchungen bei fischen dass sie diese wirbel nutzen und sich von ihnen im wasser quasi abdr cken
5654044 our approach is unique in the world no one else has yet developed customized immunotherapy using the virus from individual patients
5654045 this experimental technique remains long and costly for the moment but were hoping it will hold the promise of a completely innovative and widely available treatment in the future
5654046 at this stage we have shown that the technique doesnt cause side effects or an undesirable auto immune response
5654047 health canada has approved a multicentre clinical trial across the country that will let us further assess the techniques effectiveness at controlling hiv reproduction were hoping that the fda in the united states will also give us the go ahead soon so that our pharmaceutical partner argos therapeutics can begin testing in the united states

5654052 we now can study how iaps contribute to the development of cancer in a living animal and develop drugs to prevent or thwart the disease
5654053 cancer cells thrive by disabling the molecular machinery that tells sick cells to die
5654054 by removing the ring we wanted to see whether we would trick the machinery to turn back on and thats what happened cells die more readily making it much more difficult for cancer to be established
5654055 we need to use genetics to sort out which individual iaps contribute to tumors and which iaps we need to target in order to cure cancer
5654056 this was a very big step in understanding what role iaps play in cancer but it isnt the last
5654057 nur wenn der vogel mit einem gelben punkt markiert und der spiegel unverdeckt war begann die elster den punkt zu entfernen
5654058 das zeigt uns dass sie im spiegelbild tats chlich sich selbst erkannt hatten
5654059 der nachweis des selbsterkennens bei elstern zeigt dagegen dass diese leistungen in der evolution mehrfach und unabh ngig voneinander entstanden sein m ssen
5654060 is that big brains enhance the rate of evolutionary diversification by facilitating changes in behavior which would place new selection pressures on populations and favor adaptive divergence
5654061 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
5654062 the results are actually highly dependent on the surface chemistry
5654063 in other words you dont get this result just by attaching drugs to any nanotubes
5654064 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumor
5654065 but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumor which should further enhance the treatment efficacy
5654066 we are definitely hoping to be able to push this to practical applications into the clinic this is one step forward
5654067 but it will still take time to truly prove the efficacy and the safety
5654068 i know i put extra water in the kettle so i could listen to it whistle for a while its such a cheery sound
5654069 our program is going to focus on creating leaders not just practitioners but people who can go out and basically be a green missionary who can help transform the world
5654070 i know thats what coach dungy wants thats what the police department wants is to get in front of problems and stop them before we have to respond to them and investigate them
5654071 were hoping reaching out with someone like coach dungy will help get that message across
5654072 he is such a genuine and credible person and carries such respect in the community
5654073 nothing is what it seems people arent who you think they are dont trust anything and question everything
5654074 since we are old people we go on at 7 30pm
5654075 die hebben razend hun best gedaan om het voor elkaar te krijgen ik ga niet de beschuldigende vinger in hun richting wijzen

5654078 after going through charley this doesnt seem nothing more than a gust of wind

5654080 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5654081 we just want to make sure its not a problem

5654084 this is a genuinely transformational deal which makes lonely planet content available regardless of time or place it will help answer all those questions which travellers frequently have on the road such as what should i explore today or where should i go for dinner tonight together with nokia we will help more travellers connect profoundly with their world everyday

5654090 nato also needs to reassure those partners likely to be the next targets of russian pressure and possible aggression first and foremost ukraine this means rethinking natos enlargement strategy in the mid 1990s nato adopted an enlargement strategy based on integration and not as a strategic response to russia we consciously raised the bar and requirements for new members our focus was less on protection than on democratic reforms to help anchor these countries to the west but we also consciously left ourselves the option of lowering the bar in the future if the security environment took a turn for the worse it now has done just that and we need to shift our criteria again

5654138 telephony is critical to the success of our company and gohello has enabled an easy to use mobile service which our employees love and requires no technical expertise or understanding i would highly recommend gohellos allmobile telephony to anyone wanting to move away from the restrictions and complications of a fixed line phone system
5654139 with our previous telephony solution we often felt that important phone calls were missed due to our small workforce and travelling demands the gohello solution has overcome this as calls are now routed directly to employees mobiles our customers may not have noticed our new telephone system but that can only be a good thing by using gohello we dont need to worry about taking messages keeping the office manned or costly business calls leaving us to do what we do best running the business
5654140 the survey paints a stark picture of the challenging business environment that has emerged in the uk over the past year with the economy facing its most difficult period since the early 1990s this is now compounded by high and uncertain oil and commodity prices creating inflationary pressures and fall out from the uk housing market downturn which has continued to gather pace at the same time we are seeing a new realism among businesses about the need to weather the current economic conditions with projected staff and capital investment both significantly down on this time last year

5654144 this is surely an indictment on customer data standards at any organisation that sends transactional documents all of whom want to grasp the transpromo opportunity but a section of whom seem to be undermining that opportunity
5654145 if transpromo is to be effectively exploited there needs to be an improvement in customer data standards two fifths of the population have received bills or statements addressed to the wrong person in the last six months which could seriously undermine consumer attitudes to advertising carried in those documents the opportunities presented by transpromo are probably very considerable but their effective use requires british business to make significant enhancements to the way it manages and updates customer records

5654169 to the best of my ability all the information given is correct at the time of signing
5654170 im still sort of practising for the final so im not going to pull up or not remind myself of how hard it is
5654171 im just saying i raced that like a heat not like a final if i raced that like a final i could have probably expected another half second
5654172 maybe thats saying a lot considering the time but thats how i felt
5654173 tonight is going to be the same objective really come in focused rested up and do the best i can
5654174 its great to just get the experience of the olympics and get myself in front of the judges
5654175 my point was to forget what happened in the prelims
5654176 i came in this morning and it was a brand new day mentally i feel much better than i did yesterday i came back to priorities and what to think about in the right moment

5654182 second in the race today and third overall im very happy with that going into the medal race
5654183 its all to play for ive got the gold medal in my sights and ive got great momentum going into this race
5654184 im the one coming up from behind and the other girls are the ones looking back over their shoulders i hope to maintain that go in with a positive tomorrow and see how it goes
5654185 its very very close and its all about believing in yourself and your own chances and really giving it your best shot
5654186 threatens the integrity of the relationship of industry academia patients and society
5654187 the purpose of advantage was neither to seek a new indication nor to perform post marketing surveillance
5654188 the objectives were to provide product trial among a key physician group to accelerate uptake of vioxx as the second entrant in a highly competitive new class and gather data important to this customer group
5654189 the advantage trial utilized this important group of prescribers as investigators in addition to gaining experience with vioxx many of these physicians gained a highly coveted introduction to clinical research
5654190 without access to internal documents the intent of pharmaceutical companies in conducting clinical trials is nearly impossible to prove even with access to internal documents study intent may be hard to prove
5654191 an open label design no control group a very large projected enrollment relative to the importance of the question a short term study of a chronic disease a study of an already approved drug
5654192 if journals are interested in publishing findings that are new and likely to change practice they are likely to turn down seeding trials
5654193 we thought there was an important message in the trial but not the one that merck was pushing
5654194 having been burned on this one were going to be more careful
5654195 simply shining a bright light on their existence may have already sown the seeds of their destruction
5654196 the next step would be a societal consensus that it is wrong to deceive institutional review boards and participants about the true purpose of a trial
5654197 spate of school expansions is no tonic for student proficiency
5654198 one of the underlying goals was that by updating our buildings one of the byproducts would be to increase achievement
5654199 everything we do should be focused on how to improve student achievement the neighborhood school project was part of that mix

5654207 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
5654208 even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion
5654209 so for people to suggest that i and the illinois medical society so illinois doctors were somehow in favor of withholding life saving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous it defies commonsense and it defies imagination and for people to keep on pushing this is offensive
5654210 was not the bill that was presented at the state level
5654211 the act of killing a just born child was considered so heinous that the federal bill the born alive infant protection act was supported by pro abortion senator barbara boxer d calif and unopposed by naral the national abortion and reproductive rights action league
5654212 senator obamas position in the illinois senate was to oppose any legislation that would protect such innocent life everyone else was clear that the bill addressed infanticide not abortion
5654213 behold children are a gift of the lord the fruit of the womb is a reward
5654214 were local we live here and work here and we support this country
5654215 were patriotic in the sense that we want this country to be as good as it can be
5654216 the brochures say nothing about dying and nothing about post traumatic stress syndrome
5654217 the issue is both sides should be allowed in or neither side should be
5654218 whats the fear that students are going to get indoctrinated
5654219 career days are to provide our students with steps they can take after graduation whether that be brown university bridgewater state college new england tractor trailer school or the army or navy
5654220 this group wants to have a debate thats not what these career days are for
5654221 if we open it up to them others seeing it as a forum for discussion will want to set up tables too
5654222 but most of the horror stories they told were from far off in other parts of the country not in bridgewater
5654223 because im not hearing complaints from people here in town im not sure we need to do anything about this
5654224 just as we would have if the garden club or any other group wanted to come in
5654225 we allow them to come and display antiwar messages and antirecruitment materials at the same time we allow military recruiters to come
5654226 also when we announce our back to school program we inform the students they can sign forms that night to opt out

5654228 some people never go crazy what truly horrible lives they must lead
5654229 almost everyone is born a genius and buried an idiot
5654230 with the development of things like the csu dentistry school and the new hospital this kind of accommodation is going to be in great demand in the future
5654231 we should not just accept the design based on the thought that it will be better than what is already there at the site
5654232 many of the fences had fallen flat knocked over by a steady wall of water
5654233 the water came off the ranges and ended up almost filling lake cargelligo which had previously been almost dry
5654234 this is the single most exciting vaccine in a very long time
5654235 its a very simple procedure and while the adverse side effects are at a rate thats higher than some other vaccines they are minimal
5654236 some people believe that the vaccine encourages young girls to have sex but thats not the case
5654237 although we know that kids have sex most people in the world have sex
5654238 for metropolitan students it can be a big ask to move to the country all of these guys current dentistry graduates have been educated in the city two weeks work experience doesnt really give that lifestyle experience
5654239 hospitals have the infrastructure already and all of the local practitioners are looking at succession planning
5654240 there is no doubt we clinicians were disenchanted when the plans were released in january but when our orange delegation of clinicians met with premier morris iemma we were given a commitment the extra funds would be found for changes
5654241 we havent got everything in these plans but we have most things we asked for there has been compromise but we clinicians have got virtually everything we asked for
5654242 this is the sixth competition ive done i want to turn professional in the next couple of years you learn so much off of the pros
5654243 the body of the martyr will stay in the building until the killers are captured
5654244 the operation on the diyala governance centre early this morning was done without the knowledge or assistance of coalition forces
5654245 floods in the cuu long river delta happen every year so people are used to taking preventive measures for crops and life
5654246 in the past floods caused problem to transportation and it was hard for children to come to school but in recent years vietnam has built protective dykes and residential areas above the flood peaking level
5654247 since the floods are to wash away alum we expect the yield of the next winter spring rice crop to be good at least on par with this year
5654248 floods are forecast to rise above the average level in many years
5654249 i didnt see any tanks or armoured personnel carriers leaving the conflict zone
5654250 what is at issue today is making a lasting ceasefire out of the still very fragile situation the very delicate situation in georgia
5654251 we therefore urge russia to pull out of core georgia
5654252 prevent weapons smuggling and members of foreign terrorist organisations from entering russia
5654253 you have to ask yourself why they are here still
5654254 they are expecting a provocation or they will mount one themselves who knows it only needs one gunman somewhere to open fire the russians still dont exclude the option of taking tbilisi
5654255 not here it seems theres some kind of agreement among these scalpers they are in cahoots about selling tickets they work together and help each other so if one strays too far from the fold in offering lower prices that person is on the black list

5654264 we are delighted that the british public has voted enid blyton its best loved author
5654265 her storytelling is timeless and this result confirms that her books are still a firm favourite today
5654266 whats interesting about this research is how it reinforces the importance of childhood reading and demonstrates how influenced we are in later life by the authors and books we read as a child
5654267 anyone who tries anything like that will face a crushing response
5654268 rear units as well as second and third echelon units are being pulled back first the vanguard units will be pulled back at the final stage

5654271 michael felt people got too much credit for datasets already and that making them more widely citeable would actually devalue the contribution the example he cited was genome sequences this is a case where for historical reasons the publication of a dataset as a paper in a high ranking journal is considered appropriate in a sense i agree with this case the problem here is that for this specific case it is allowable to push a dataset sized peg into a paper sized hole this has arguably led to an over valuing of the sequence data itself and an undervaluing of the science it enables small molecule crystallography is similar in some regards with the publication of crystal structures in paper form bulking out the publication lists of many scientists there is a real sense in which having a publication stream for data making the data itself directly citeable would lead to a devaluation of these contributions on the other hand it would lead to a situation where you would cite what you used rather than the paper in which it was perhaps peripherally described i think more broadly that the publication of data will lead to greater efficiency in research generally and more diversity in the streams to which people can contribute
5654272 so to come back around to the original point the value of different forms of contribution is not due to the fact that they are non traditional or because of the medium per se it is because they are different

5654284 the writing process was a little different for this album with joe writing pretty much all the material this gives the album a very cohesive and flowing feel and this album is definitely our most diverse material thus far the artwork is also amazing having been completed by deeds of flesh those not familiar with his work should check it out you will be amazed
5654285 the new cd is a mixture of everything we have done as well as adding in new elements to continue the progression we are on as a band no point releasing the same album twice right like joe engineered the album but this time we enlisted the help of metal guru post new topics in this forum

5654295 of course the mans a dangerous criminal but at the same time you have to tip your cap a little bit

5654307 pat comes from a place far far away and when he arrived he thought that humans were only capable of meanness he had no idea that they could show love too
5654308 it is an utter travesty whats happened to our beloved square
5654309 my im glad that the paper has exposed the filthy things those people are up to

5654334 lets remember youve been down this road before many times mind you and almost every time you thought that maybe this is when pavano is finally going to step up and be a help he does something to remind you that he is carl pavano

5654348 i couldnt believe it i asked him what happened and he said i just felt uneasy about it he thought i would be mad but if youre not confident on a bike it really makes no sense to ride one

5654431 this project marks a highly important phase for alliance amp leicester within the wider commercial asset finance development programme
5654432 one of our key objectives has been to provide staff within our business with a fully supported lease management system and operating platform from which to manage existing agreements and facilitate business growth over the next 3 to 4 years both tietoenator and the banks technology team have worked tremendously hard to support delivery of this key objective
5654433 a fully hosted managed service brings a number of benefits to the bank
5654434 we now have a one stop service from tietoenator with the organisation taking full responsibility for all aspects of running the instalment credit suite from software development to system infrastructure reducing the banks need to rely on more than one third party for support in addition we also benefit from fixed it costs improved disaster recovery with the business able to recover almost immediately from a break in service and a faster more robust system which ensures continuity of service to our customers
5654435 these changes will enable us to further simplify our processes which in turn will allow us to provide additional tailored products for the commercial asset finance markets

5654452 in our dialogue we have jointly affirmed that the decisions of a local or regional church must not only foster communion in the present context but must also be in agreement with the church of the past and in a particular way with the apostolic church as witnessed in the scriptures the early councils and the patristic tradition
5654453 it also seems to us the catholic church that the anglican commitment to being episcopally led and synodically governed has not always functioned in such a way as to maintain the apostolicity of the faith and that synodical government misunderstood as a kind of parliamentary process has at times blocked the sort of episcopal leadership envisaged by cyprian st cyprian cited earlier

5654554 we call on the government and judicial authorities to ensure the protection of prisoners to punish torturers and not to include them on amnesty lists
5654555 its true that there is no specific law but they torturers could be charged for voluntary blows and injuries
5654556 the culprits are being investigated but this type of case takes time
5654557 we dont have statistics for previous years but there were definitely hundreds of cases of torture in 2004 and 2005 before the number started to decline in 2006
5654558 68 inmates died in prison for various reasons such as illness or mortar attacks but 14 cases are still under review because the death probably occurred under torture

5654572 if youre beautiful this doesnt apply to you please look elsewhere because our standards are very very low and it will stay that way
5654573 you women may feel offended by his remark but think about it this invitation is in all honesty an insult to the male species of mt isa fuck if youre issuing an invitation to women for the benefit of your men shouldnt you be inviting beautiful women instead hey lads we dont think you deserve beautiful women so were just gonna invite the ugly ones while it is true the men there might not deserve beautiful women that isnt the point now is it where is the male uproar in this issue why is it that only the women in mt isa are protesting to the remark and the men are sitting around taking it with a big smug grin on their faces so maybe the men of mt isa are fuckwits not to understand the implicit meaning of that statement so maybe they do deserve ugly bitches after all hey mt isa women come over to brisbane where we men are sick of bitchy obese city girls wearing tights 2 sizes smaller for their fat legs we sure need our share of country chicks take that you miners you can have all the uglies you want hahahahaha

5654576 no wonder mt isa men are wary about dating mt isa female apparently they all walk down the road with a grin on their face for no reason at all not only are you ugly youre smiling alone that makes you psychugly
5654577 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits

5654583 i think the challenge of the modern medical school is how do you teach students to be scientifically rigorous in an era when science is exploding

5654585 how do you bridge those two needs to be both rigorous and effective
5654586 core skills that allow people to continue to learn for a lifetime as opposed to pop out of medical school knowing everything which was the old model

5654592 nici in saloanele noastre de la spital nu avem cazuri atit de grave cum sint cele provocate de basescita
5654593 nastase este o victima directa a lui basescu a pierdut totul din cauza lui asta dupa ce astepta sa devina un fel de ludovic al xiv lea si pregatise totul pentru asta insclusiv constitutia isi apara acest eu supranascisiac prin mecanismul de negare adica faptele de care e acuzat nu exista realitatea nu exista si prin cel de proiectie in sensul ca altul e vinovat adica basescu
5654594 totul este dublat de teama pentru ca nastase nu e un tip barbatos nastase evita orice fel de confruntare ca dovada ca a apelat la votul colegilor din parlament si se apara pe blogg in loc sa se duca in fata procurorilor unde totul s ar fi terminat mult mai rapid
5654595 aceasta superobsesie basesciana arata ca in forul lui interior aspira sa fie ca basescu despre care crede ca i a luat locul ce i se cuvenea este vorba si de complexul masculului alfa
5654596 narcisismul il determina pe nastase sa aiba numai reactii afective si nu rationale
5654597 in plus este o ura nesfirsita care ii blocheaza mecanismele elementare de aparare daca faptele nu exista de ce nu se duce la dna

5654604 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
5654605 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
5654606 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
5654607 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
5654608 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

5654617 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government

5654619 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price

5654673 the figure of nearly a million pounds is incredible given dudley councils consistent inability to communicate with the people of the borough on library closures school closures and anything else that requires real public participation
5654674 im amazed that they spend so much it seems that this lot are all spin and no substance communication is important to councils but the failure to communicate and spend a whole lot of money doing so seems to suggest the dudley taxpayer is not getting value for money
5654675 i honestly believe we get fantastic value for money with our marketing and communications team i dont think 24 people is excessive to look after the needs of an authority which is one of the largest metropolitan boroughs in the country
5654676 being 21 in the year of the tournament he could play for the players personally its wonderful to be involved in international football
5654677 wouldnt it be a real feather in jarvos cap if he got selected if they are involved that would be fine by me
5654678 five players are away but theres nothing i can do about it i dont worry about things i cant effect
5654679 they are all good lads who will do everything correct in terms of the preparation for their game and looking after themselves coming back here
5654680 im not worried about it sam vokes and dave edwards both might be grateful of a full game while wayne hennessey has also gone with the wales u21s
5654681 weve got kights playing and andy keogh is away with ireland whatever part kights plays hes got wednesday thursday and friday to recover
5654682 but theyre playing international football as someone who has played and managed at that level its terrific its lovely to be involved wouldnt all the clubs like to have five international players going away
5654683 id love to have five players good enough to play international football but you dont want them going away playing international football let them go and if they come back injured i wont be happy about it but ill play someone else
5654684 romania have done very well but we definitely have the quality and surely one of the best under 21 teams wales have ever had
5654685 theyre all back on thursday and friday it doesnt bother me at all and whingeing about it gets you nowhere
5654686 all youre doing is laying the foundation for an excuse on saturday if we get beat and im not like that i never have been and i never will be
5654687 well have a look at him when he comes back but he could be in contention for saturday hes played four games over there so his fitness levels shouldnt be in question well see how he is after the journey and ill chat with him when returns
5654688 the reason he is here because we identified he is a very good player we are looking forward to getting him back into the squad and back into contention for a place in the team
5654689 i spoke to giannis agent the other day and watched his game against argentina the other night he played against lionel messi roman riquelme and people like that in an amazing arena
5654690 it was great to see a west bromwich albion player playing in such an arena and such a game against such great players
5654691 it was a great atmosphere and there some of the best players in the world on the pitch gianni did exceptionally well he was fast athletic and comfortable on the ball
5654692 im glad for myself and the team that he is on his way back and will be back in training on thursday but for the boy it would have been a great occasion to play in the semi final of the olympics against brazil
5654693 i watched him walk on the pitch alongside full argentina internationals and great great players it was quite special and hopefully the premier league arena will hold no fears for him
5654694 it is obviously disappointing not to be selected as you want to be playing for your country
5654695 mr capello does come to villa quite a lot and i am not going to give up we have just got to keep doing the business for our club
5654696 that is all we can do but i want to play for my country ive played for the u21s and i want to be in the full squad
5654697 if mr capello doesnt put you in the squad then we have to go out like on sunday and prove him wrong i think we myself and ashley young did that
5654698 rental properties are more reasonable in staffordshire than other parts of the country we are experiencing increased demand for rented property and have been exceptionally busy for the last couple of months
5654699 sometimes we are showing them at 500 which is due to the increasing demand in the rental market
5654700 we have now got some homes which are up for sale or for rent so people will do either
5654701 plans are being implemented to ensure there is minimal damage to the site and to make sure the park recovers fully for up and coming events
5654702 the norton commando was the first big bike i saw and i decided that it was what i was going to aim for
5654703 i spotted it one day outside the swimming baths when i was a child living in gnosall and i couldnt get it out of my head
5654704 my dad helped me to work on my first motorbikes as during the second world war he was in india as maintenance ground crew for the raf and so we could use his expertise before you get a motorbike you have to learn on a moped i was 16 when i got my one and i thought it was brilliant
5654705 that was when i got my first experience of fixing motorbikes because it wasnt long before the gear box went on my moped and my dad helped me to repair it
5654706 after school i did an apprenticeship in mechanical engineering before doing a degree i ended up lecturing at walsall college of art and technology for 15 years in mechanical engineering
5654707 two years ago i thought i would make the break from teaching and so far it seems to have paid off
5654708 in the last six months i have so much work that people are having to wait until the end of september for me to get to their job
5654709 i have been involved with vintage bikes for over 30 years and i really got into them when i was at stafford grammar school
5654710 bikes which were made locally such as bsas nortons and triumphs are phenomenally popular in the west midlands so much so that dozens of local companies stock the parts for them and it is easy to get items in the next day whereas for other bikes i can be waiting weeks
5654711 at these events people race bikes that were built before 1972 and we meet around seven times a year at places like brands hatch and donnington park
5654712 a protest committee intending to protest a boat shall inform her as soon as reasonable possible
5654713 with my wife it is a bit of a role reversal to home where she is in charge but there are certain rules and regulations to follow at work anyway
5654714 i dont really see him as my husband while we are at work i do sometimes talk about work at home though if there is something i didnt get to say to him it can be handy
5654715 trevor does early morning shifts and i work a bit later so i dont see too much of him but when i do i can ask him what he wants for his tea
5654716 he had been drinking with a friend and then they parted company and he decided to go and get some cigarettes
5654717 he was by the kfc and the next thing he knew someone was on his face biting his nose and someone else bottled him in the face
5654718 its the viciousness of it all it was just horrible why would you want to bite somebody else
5654719 andrew has always been quite a confident person but he has lost that now
5654720 to give that child everything that the parent didnt have as a child
5654721 our medieval events are so colourful that it is no wonder so many people always come to the town to see the re enactors at work
5654722 with such exciting activities and displays on offer including the magnificent birds of prey there will be something for everyone at this event
5654723 the new paving and environmental improvements will create an attractive meeting place for local residents and visitors and in the future will help link the city centre with the proposed friarsgate development
5654724 we would like to thank everyone for rallying around and taking part in all the fundraising events we have organised to remember shane and sam
5654725 we are planning to make the family fun day a yearly event and hopefully next time round we will be able to raise even more money
5654726 both shane and sam were airlifted to hospital and we wanted to do our bit to thank them for all their effort they put into trying to save their lives
5654727 dad loved the racing scene and derived so much pleasure from my involvement in the sport it was a marvellous moment for him to see my daughter win on his favourite horse
5654728 he was recognised by everybody as a true gentleman essentially he was a family man but he was also greatly respected by colleagues
5654729 but i think that is conservative given the enthusiastic response we have seen so far
5654730 i think sales of 4 000 cars would be a possibility by the end of 2009
5654731 the new cars have a much higher spec than the old ones
5654732 its great to be back here making them again weve been waiting a long time to get to this point
5654733 it was a bit empty with so many people missing but i am working with a lot of the people who were with me when i was at rover they are a great bunch to work with we have a laugh
5654734 they said there was just something about working here and they couldnt wait to get back
5654735 in terms of the quality it is way ahead of the old car ive had a chance to drive three of the cars as the new one has been developed and each one has got better and better
5654736 he was unassuming charming and a great gentleman in every sense of the word
5654737 godfrey bostock was a long time friend of my family and a highly respected popular and effective colleague on the claverley company and mna boards renowned for his wise counsel and wide experience of business life
5654738 his sense of fun and good humour in the face of very serious health problems aroused the sympathy and admiration of all who knew him he will be greatly missed
5654739 its very similar to what they do on the battlefield
5654740 you look out for your buddy so let us look out for our buddy in other ways as well
5654741 i believe that that is 1 800 people who would not have come forward otherwise
5654742 those 1 800 people got counseling medical care and assistance
5654743 i would go as far to say that the program is only as good as the sexual assault response coordinator
5654744 this is a command program and we have to have command support for this program to work
5654745 where we see it work best is when the sexual assault response coordinator and the commander work in unison
5654746 the united states and our allies stand with the people of georgia and their democratically elected government
5654747 georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
5654748 in the years since it gained independence after the soviet unions collapse georgia has become a courageous democracy with people making the tough choices that are required of free societies
5654749 to help others achieve the liberty that theyve struggled so hard to obtain
5654750 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside
5654751 and now for the first time in memory europe is becoming a continent that is whole free and at peace
5654752 unfortunately russia has tended to view the expansion of freedom and democracy as a threat to its interests
5654753 free and prosperous societies on russias borders will advance russias interests by serving as sources of stability and economic opportunity
5654754 the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
5654755 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
5654756 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
5654757 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west economically and politically and in security arrangements
5654758 my guess is that everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead
5654759 i think russias got some serious work to do to try and work its way back into the family of nations that are trying to work together and build democracy and build their economies working together
5654760 for the most part we have a uav on station for the majority of missions that involve the capture of high value targets or terrorists
5654761 the aircraft is an active contributor to the actual apprehension of these criminals its hard to imagine combat today without uavs the aircrafts capabilities are continuously improving and they are beginning to do a lot of the same missions as our manned aircraft
5654762 our guys fly them out hand them off to the brigade combat teams in theater and at that time the specific brigade tactical uav elements actually fly the missions
5654763 the brigades route the aircraft back into our air space and the uav operators here pick the aircraft back up and land them once they land we conduct maintenance and prep them for another mission
5654764 everything we do in terms of maintaining the aircraft is annotated by inputting information into our computer system we keep track of just about anything you can think of from actual flight hours to required services and inspections
5654765 the uavs can provide at least 70 percent of the support you would get from an attack helicopter minus the armament
5654766 the operators can observe perform route reconnaissance and report immediately over voice what they see to the ground forces very similar to conventional aerial reconnaissance methods its very helpful
5654767 the shadow provides coverage for a lot of raids we do road scans for roadside bombs and have actually caught terrorists in the act of implanting these bombs in the road the uav mission is imperative to todays combat operations
5654768 when the infantry troops are going into a certain area to clear buildings well go in ahead of time and scan the area and well be able to report to them exact grids of potential enemies in the area
5654769 keeping soldiers safe on the battlefield is no 1 this is definitely a technology that will always be part of the fight
5654770 i look at it as these guys talking to us
5654771 its them coming back and saying we appreciate what you have done
5654772 i didnt know the path we would take to get here but i really believed that we would get here
5654773 i knew the money would come because i knew that we were doing gods work
5654774 it was just a matter of sticking with it and focusing on the right things
5654775 when we went to them and asked for support it wasnt let me think about it
5654776 it was everybody believing in that goal and working together
5654777 this isnt an individual achievement its what we have accomplished as a team
5654778 were working on the final touch up fixing little nicks and scratches and dings
5654779 from the families all the way to the guys out here swinging a hammer everyone was behind each other helping each other out
5654780 its absolutely amazing absolutely stunning especially when you see it at night
5654781 from a distance they all look alike but close up you can see that every one is different just like people
5654782 it might be something as simple as the way a stone sits in it but each one is unique
5654783 life can turn in an instant so we need to celebrate it
5654784 its about remembering how we all felt as a country and how we came together and its remembering that we are more alike than we are different in this world
5654785 so why dont we figure out how to work together as opposed to focusing on the differences
5654786 we officially passed final cert on our first try friday august 15th
5654787 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5654788 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5654789 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5654790 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5654791 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast
5654792 an explanation from the russians for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5654793 it didnt take that long for the russian forces to get in and it really shouldnt take that long for them to get out
5654794 im just ready to go there and have fun and thats what im going to do tibbs said during an aug
5654795 and i really cant wait to go out there and represent the united states the united states navy as well and the whole military
5654796 and thats what i tell them at the beginning because sometimes they can hear it from a doctor they can hear it from their family but when they hear it from somebody who has actually sat in a hospital bed and gone from a hospital bed to an olympic podium it gives them a lot more hope
5654797 i remember doing it and it was probably the hardest run ive ever done in my life
5654798 but after that day i was able to progress a lot more and now i can run 400 meters in 53 seconds
5654799 i stayed on active duty and went to the games in 2004 i won a gold medal and a silver medal a gold medal in the 4 x 100 relay and a silver in the mens pentathlon setting a new american record
5654800 i then went to 2006 world championships i won my first gold medal in the individual pentathlon and now ive qualified for the 2008 games where im going to be competing in the pentathlon the 200 meters the long jump and the 400 meters and hopefully the relay again
5654801 the whole olympic dream really didnt start until after i lost my leg
5654802 i was 22 years old or 23 when i started thinking hey i could go to the paralympic games thats really when my dream started
5654803 he ran 1 41 in the 800 meters and hes one of three people to ever do that in history of all sports period
5654804 and hes definitely an inspiration to me so hes definitely one of my olympic heroes
5654805 its about just getting back to your life and competing in sports and just playing sports
5654806 we are continuing to consider all alternatives that will maximize value to our stockholders
5654807 we are engaged in discussions with other parties as part of a formal process to generate greater value and will act quickly to assist ea in moving expeditiously through our process
5654808 i think ea called take two and said you can either participate or not
5654809 i think take two is going to negotiate a dollar per share higher and then claim victory a deal is going to get done
5654810 resistance is futile your technologial distinctiveness shall be added to ours
5654811 resistance is futile your creative distinctiveness shall be sublimated by ours
5654812 after going through charley this doesnt seem nothing more than a gust of wind
5654813 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5654814 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5654815 we said georgia would eventually become a member of nato alongside ukraine and thats certainly the position that we will be advocating today
5654816 we need to open the door to get the military monitors in now
5654817 some critics say japanese mobile technology tends to be quirky like the galapagos islands
5654818 but asian nations such as taiwan and south korea have for years expressed great interest in japanese cell phones
5654819 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5654820 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues

5654826 we still want to see what grants might be available
5654827 the news that canfor would not rebuild the ncp plant sent those hopeful the plant would be rebuilt into another tailspin
5654828 however despite having over 5 000 forest workers unemployed in the region the efforts of service providers educational institutions and government agenises have shown significant progress in their efforts to assist these workers
5654829 collectively we are all pulling in the same direction to address the needs of threatened or displaced workers but more needs to be done
5654830 these are extremely trying times for workers and their families and we all have to be innovative in our efforts to deal with this present situation giving workers the tools skills and financial support needed to maintain employment or seek employment is a smart investment for the short and long term and that also means changing our whole way of thinking when applying resources and funding to ensure the maximum benefit for workers and their family
5654831 the forest worker will provide valuable information to assist governments educational institutions and service providers with data from over 1 500 forest workers in all sectors of the industry union and non union

5654871 h ufige temperaturwechsel uv strahlung und permanente luftfeuchtigkeit setzen vor allem holzschwellen schon nach relativ kurzer zeit zu die ausbesserung einer schienentrasse ist nicht nur mit einem erheblichen materiellen organisatorischen und personalaufwand sondern auch mit daraus resultierenden hohen internen und externen kosten verbunden
5654872 dadurch verl ngern sich auch die wartungszyklen erheblich mit entsprechenden kostenvorteilen f r den netzbetreiber
5654873 das polyurethanmaterial sieht aus wie holz und vereint alle positiven eigenschaften des naturprodukts mit denen eines modernen verbundwerkstoffs die pur schwellen lassen sich mit den von der holzverarbeitung her bekannten werkzeugen s gen fr sen schrauben nageln und verkleben sogar noch dauerhafter als holz
5654874 im vergleich zu beton zeichnet sich das polyurethanmaterial durch ein deutlich niedrigeres gewicht und vor allem durch eine reproduzierbare ebenheit aus die vor allem bei weichen sehr wichtig ist
5654875 eine gegen ber dem konventionellen gleisbau mehr als dreifach prognostizierte liegezeit macht vor dem hintergrund hoher arbeitskosten diese weichen bzw gleisschwellen auch f r nicht bundeseigene eisenbahninfrastrukturbetreiber interessant aufgrund ihrer leichtgewichtigkeit sind die schwellen auch sehr gut f r den einsatz auf br cken geeignet

5654896 muito novos no triatlo enquanto os que foram ao p dio j c andam h muitos anos
5654897 sinto que podem ser dois atletas que podem dar ainda muitas alegrias a portugal treino todos os dias com o bruno e ele precisava assim de uma prova
5654898 o projecto da federa o e a estrutura que t m adoptado tem sido um espect culo t m apostado bastante em captar talentos e cada vez mais nos atletas
5654899 acho que falta atitude falta mesmo terem um pouco a consci ncia do que um evento como estes isto tem de vir mesmo do cora o e n o sinto muita gente a vir para os jogos com isso c dentro v m c e pronto olha est feito aqui tens de competir a fundo mas isso que dif cil
5654900 como n o assumem a responsabilidade deles come am a julgar coisas exteriores a desculpar se ou a criticar algu m ou alguma coisa pat tico a pior coisa que um atleta pode fazer
5654901 quando venho a uma prova sei que venho preparada e o que pode acontecer menos quando h um imprevisto como uma queda ou furo nuns jogos ol mpicos o resultado que se obt m bom ou mau nunca deve ser para julgar algu m nunca devemos ver dentro de n s o que fizemos para ter aquele resultado se foi tudo correcto ou n o a nossa consci ncia que tem de dizer isso e avaliar nos sabermos o que realmente fizemos
5654902 so as you may have heard we are being sued by our former record company for the ridiculously oversized totally unrealistic and pretty silly but slightly clever sum of 30 000 000 insane yea thats what we said too
5654903 we had been signed to our record contract for 9 years
5654904 yes we have been sued by emi but not for failing to deliver music or for quitting we have been sued by the corporation quite simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void
5654905 if you think the fact that we have sold in excess of 2 million records and have never been paid a penny is pretty unbelievable well so do we
5654906 i asked the relevant parliament department to investigate when and whether a case file concerning the former aegean minister had been sent by the justice ministry to parliament the search showed that such a file never reached parliament
5654907 this is a work that absolutely stopped at nothing in order to desecrate something that all muslims hold sacred
5654908 an insult to all muslims in the world and especially for us here in serbia
5654909 it was not our intention to offend anybody which is why we have immediately recalled the book from all stores and apologized to the islamic community
5654910 we hope that this affair will be used as a lesson so that this type of thing does not occur again anymore
5654911 death of a church occurs when unbelievers are allowed to take over ministries in the church it happens when a church becomes more concerned with form and liturgy than it is with life on a spiritual level death occurs when a church becomes more concerned about welfare and social ills than it is about salvation it happens when a church loves systems more than it loves jesus christ and it happens when a church becomes more concerned with material things than spiritual reality thats how a church dies it all is a result of sin sin in any form that the church tolerates whether it is in the members or the leaders tolerance of sin begins the cycle then comes the tolerance of unbelievers in the church until no one cares who is a believer or an unbeliever the end comes when the man who runs the church isnt a believer sins of commission and omission kill a church little by little when that happens christians become carnal soon afterwards unbelievers come into the church and then a total tolerance for sin exists the church begins to die and the people who really love jesus christ leave only to be replaced by people who dont know him
5654912 there is no place in the prison where she can go to be alone she can get no peace and quiet this is not the lifestyle she is accustomed to

5654915 i think that hp continues to be very upbeat about what it can do with eds and will go to great lengths on the conference call to convince people of that
5654916 independent research clearly demonstrates that the wave keyboard can help improve the comfort of your typing experience
5654917 the keyboards wave like shape is popular because it provides comfort without requiring people relearn how to type unlike traditional ergonomic keyboards and with the addition of the mx1100 mouse which was designed according to ergonomic principles our new desktop gives you even more comfort than the original logitech desktop cordless wave
5654918 at this point we have no relationship and i dont see that changing
5654919 its just gotten to a point where i think lines were crossed
5654920 if you ask me coaches should be coaches management should be management and i dont think those lines should be crossed but when you cross those lines you put yourself in postiion for things like this to happen
5654921 they made different promises saying they would take care of me
5654922 it all goes back to last year even before camp
5654923 we need serious constitutional review by people that have the moral authority to do so

5654933 i take the full responsibility for daniela yordanovas positive doping test
5654934 but last spring i incidentally bought some medicines from greece and turkey and most probably they contained some contaminated supplements
5654935 we have to take a decision on yordanova within two months the expected sanction is a two year competition ban
5654936 there is no place in the prison where she can go to be alone she can get no peace and quiet this is not the lifestyle she is accustomed to
5654937 a young kid growing up in an oppressive family situation suddenly learns that he is one of a special class of children with special abilities who are to be educated in a remote training facility where student life is dominated by an intense game played by teams flying in midair at which this kid turns out to be exceptionally talented and a natural leader
5654938 there is no place in the prison where she can go to be alone she can get no peace and quiet this is not the lifestyle she is accustomed to
5654939 a generous incentive that will encourage those who owe money to pay up in order to avoid further checks from the tax office

5654941 nobody expected we would put together a decent team after we separated
5654942 it was only two years ago we split people thought we would be weak now the team is even better i think its easier we have a strong chance here
5654943 now weve shown our power they didnt think we would be good but we are now an excellent team
5654944 it was strange i couldnt plan anything in my life i just had to wait
5654945 we cant take any more people than is our capacity
5654946 the only answer is to come up with a common solution to bosnias problems why should we spend the money to build a new expensive system when we already have a working one just across the dividing line
5654947 it is dangerous but we cant do anything about it said ferid niksic the assistant to the warden
5654948 but its not as though if you just put away the 200 people the situation on the streets would be ideal without crime
5654949 they ordered me to pay 1 000 bosnian marka 500 euros but i couldnt afford to pay
5654950 i wouldnt want to escape because i was not guilty
5654951 i waited five or six months to start my sentence but that was good because i had time to finish up some work
5654952 there are conflicts but they happen on an individual basis rather than because of national identity
5654953 what will become a major issue for the european union in the near future
5654954 we must do all we can to curb the phenomenon of illegal immigration by helping migrants countries of origin and their residents
5654955 the problem we have faced in the past is producing enough of these coiled carbon nanotubes at a reasonable cost to make a difference
5654956 because our current method produces coiled nanotubes quickly in high yield it can be readily scaled up to industrial levels after formation the coiled nanotubes can be peeled off in one piece and placed on other surfaces to form instant cushioning coatings
5654957 if you move your hand backward as you catch the egg and increase the time of contact over which the impact occurs the impact will be less forceful and the egg will not break it is the same phenomenon experienced in catching a baseball
5654958 it was not so much offensively we were punished last year it was defensively
5654959 after the physical game we had on wednesday night i was worried before the game that we would not be sharp but we made a good start and were always in control only issue was that we could not finish the game off
5654960 west brom defended intelligently and played in a positive way
5654961 you expected them at some stage to crumble but they never did and they kept going until the last second of the game they have fantastic spirit and a positive attitude towards the game they were not dirty they were resilient and well organised
5654962 im not really worried about the lack of goals because i dont feel we were sharp enough to finish off what we created
5654963 i believe when everyone is fit we can create clear cut chances at times against west brom the final ball was not good enough too heavy not timed well enough and i feel we will improve a lot on that
5654964 nasri has shown he is an intelligent player he has good technique and can integrate well with the team
5654965 he also worked hard for the team on saturday he added something that people wanted from him in france that was to score goals he had started to score some goals towards the end of last season and had a scoring start on saturday
5654966 the quantity and quality of our serving teachers is disturbing we have about 600 000 teachers in the basic education sub sector at the moment
5654967 this number is inadequate to address the problems associated with high teacher pupil ratio in the urban centres and low teacher pupil ration in remote rural communities
5654968 the sector will need to recruit about 39 000 teachers annually for the next 8 years this requires improved budgetary provisions by states for development
5654969 there is no place in the prison where she can go to be alone she can get no peace and quiet this is not the lifestyle she is accustomed to
5654970 oh just your garden variety radio format change leaving all full time air staff without jobs nothing to be alarmed about
5654971 making the world a better place through laughter is something i have strived to do since i was a little kid and even if i never get a similar opportunity to do so then i have already made my mark
5654972 there is no place in the prison where she can go to be alone she can get no peace and quiet this is not the lifestyle she is accustomed to
5654973 by its complex and tentacular structure the scale of its criminal activity and the nature of the regulations that govern it the clan represents a particular danger
5654974 it has been one of the principle suppliers of heroin in western europe since the middle of the 90s
5654975 there are 15 people all found with the same substance this is the strangest thing because it leads to the conclusion that there has been an organized effort
5654976 there is an organized crime because that is what this is called
5654977 because it seems there is a lot of money hidden there a lot of profit
5654978 i am neither a policeman nor a detective nor judge i dont have that knowledge and i think that the time has come for the state to do something and find a solution i believe that if they wanted to they will find it and i believe they do want to
5654979 whoever does such things gets mixed up in such things commits suicide and when someone wants to commit suicide nobody can stop them
5654980 of course it has to be organized when there are so many cases with the same substance
5654981 supplied to the naive because someone who knows that this could lead them to death doesnt try it
5654982 as for fani it is a fact that they went after her i love fani very much it was wrong for her to allow those who fought her to be vindicated
5654983 i dont hide it at all we are the ones who have given this right we are paying for old sins for this reason the ioc is indeed chasing us it is a fact that they are chasing us
5654984 today we had a very difficult game to play we tried to pressure them from the beginning to try to make them lose their concentration
5654985 in the second half china played a lot better they made easy shots they made a lot of threes and came back but we didnt lose our confidence we played calm and were not nervous and controlled the game at the end
5654986 if we should be able to play close from the beginning for sure yao ming should play
5654987 yao fought he wants to play and wants to help us as much as possible but he is a player and i am the coach i make those decisions
5654988 its not the best way to complete a final but i was faced with either really going for it and risking a more serious injury that could have kept me out for months or ended my career or with taking it a bit easier
5654989 i definitely expected something better than 16 65 meters at least a personal best konstantinos douvalidis however set a new national record as he qualified for the next round of the 110 m hurdles
5654990 as the us this makes monetization more difficult especially when advertisers only purchase uk inventory
5654991 has been very successful at attracting blue chip brand advertising
5654992 nowhere in the post does ashley or shiny media note that perhaps not meeting customer needs or any other internal issues could have also led to the undesired results its very very easy to blame external factors i dont know ashley or shiny media but what i took out of his post was a good bit of education on the uk blogging market but a heck of a lot of bitching and moaning about external factors
5654993 let me clue you in on a little secret every business has external forces working against it every day

5655009 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5655010 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5655011 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5655012 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5655013 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5655014 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5655015 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5655016 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5655017 there are many important classical music festivals that take place abroad and i can say that many of the foreign artists performing in them are also participating in our festival we are interested in making our festival better known abroad and promoting music tourism we want to attract people from other countries who will want to come to syros in the summer on the occasion of the festival we need a coordinated effort to do that
5655018 i am in no position to mention any names yet but it is certain that despite the financial difficulties next years festival will be a commemorative one
5655019 fortunately we have had the support of the lavrentiadis group for three years as well as that of kyriakos tsigiroglous kintec company which has taken care of our basic needs

5655034 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

5655040 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself

5655067 the priority is for children wanting to try a snow sport for the first time one of the main barriers for children participating in snowsports can be the initial cost of the one on one lessons required at the start
5655068 these scholarships remove that barrier and give the children the opportunity to decide if snowsports is for them

5655132 apa very quickly recognized the unique value proposition that sp3 offers the electronics industry in terms of manufacturing cvd diamond and offering a broad cvd diamond product portfolio targeting thermal management applications
5655133 we expect that sp3s diatherm heat spreaders and cvd diamond wafer coating services with the significant performance improvements they deliver will be of great interest to the electronics manufacturing and packaging markets

5655137 while covered bonds backed by u s assets are a developing area there can be no doubt that the tradition of innovation that has characterized u s mortgage finance will lead to as robust a covered bond market as we have seen in europe
5655138 on july 15 the fdic issued a final policy statement to provide guidance on the availability of expedited access to collateral pledged for covered bonds issued by insured depository institutions in the event of a receivership or conservatorship and the scope of compensatory damages payable by the fdic if it exercises its power to repudiate the bonds although limited in scope this was an important step in clarifying u s regulatory treatment of covered bonds while leaving room for future amendment based on developments in the covered bond market

5655149 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
5655150 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
5655151 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
5655152 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5655153 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5655154 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety

5655164 barack obama is going to have to win this thing or lose this thing on his own
5655165 we analysts have had to pretend to know what they are thinking
5655166 and so weve had to get by without really knowing what were talking about
5655167 reaching our 100th store mark has been a great achievement as cold stone creamery continues to deliver the ultimate ice cream experience to ice cream aficionados all across the world
5655168 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5655169 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
5655170 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
5655171 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
5655172 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
5655173 just so you all know we did set a record
5655174 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5655175 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5655176 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
5655177 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
5655178 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
5655179 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
5655180 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
5655181 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5655182 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
5655183 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5655184 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5655185 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5655186 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5655187 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
5655188 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
5655189 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5655190 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5655191 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5655192 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5655193 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5655194 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
5655195 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5655196 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5655197 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5655198 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
5655199 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
5655200 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
5655201 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
5655202 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
5655203 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
5655204 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
5655205 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
5655206 hes not really sure how to best solve the complex problems relating to looming energy shortfalls
5655207 strict new environmental restrictions on coal plants make it unlikely that coal can come to the rescue as it will in virginia where the state with democratic gov timothy m kaines blessing just approved a new coal plant
5655208 china hospital supplies investment opportunities analysis and forecasts to 2012
5655209 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5655210 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5655211 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5655212 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5655213 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5655214 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5655215 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5655216 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
5655217 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
5655218 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
5655219 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
5655220 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
5655221 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
5655222 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
5655223 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
5655224 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
5655225 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
5655226 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
5655227 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
5655228 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
5655229 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
5655230 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
5655231 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
5655232 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
5655233 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5655234 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
5655235 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
5655236 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5655237 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
5655238 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5655239 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5655240 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5655241 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5655242 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5655243 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
5655244 over time wall street firms began to trade against their clients for their own account such that now the direct investment activities of a firm like goldman sachs dwarf their activities on behalf of outside customers
5655245 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
5655246 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
5655247 premier tusk jedzie na miejsce katastrofy rozche stany przykurzony jakby osobi cie przerzuca gruzy staje przed kamer i w askawo ci swojej obiecuje pomoc
5655248 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
5655249 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
5655250 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5655251 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5655252 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5655253 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
5655254 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5655255 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5655256 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5655257 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5655258 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5655259 its a black and white answer or should i say a black green and yellow answer he said in the speech to be delivered in brisbane tonight
5655260 clean coal renewables and yellowcake we must include nuclear in our future baseload clean energy mix
5655261 inconvenient truth that only nuclear power could provide baseload electricity while cutting emissions
5655262 burying mere tonnes of radioactive waste in geological stable rock was low risk
5655263 our view is that there needs to be consideration in australia given to the development of a nuclear power industry dr nelson said
5655264 we need more rational discussion about nuclear power in australia and much less of the emotive political debate weve had in the last few years
5655265 we cannot envisage any circumstance under which australia will have a nuclear power industry he said then
5655266 the last election showed that australians are absolutely of one mind about not having 25 nuclear power plants dotted around their suburbs and in and around their cities mr garrett said
5655267 are they really saying that they have a plan for 25 nuclear reactors in australia where are they going to put them senator wong said
5655268 australia has an abundance of renewable energy sources we have a lot of solar we have a lot of wind we have geothermal resources she said
5655269 more cosmopolitan version taking shape along with globalization and chinas integration into the international community
5655270 after entering china such hot money often goes into real estate or the stock market pushing up asset prices and also leads to higher inflation compromising the countrys tightening monetary policy
5655271 the knee jerk impact could keep the us dollar yuan supported the focus must remain on the policy balance between inflation growth and excess liquidity this implies yuan appreciation should remain on track albeit at a slower pace
5655272 these policy changes help facilitate freer capital and trade flows we see them as positive steps towards building a more market based economy in china
5655273 the fundamental driver behind chinas massive and rapidly rising net foreign exchange inflows about close to us 600 billion last year has been the undervalued yuan therefore without getting the yuan right the foreign exchange inflow pressures and the associated domestic inflation pressures as well as other distortions are unlikely to be fundamentally alleviated
5655274 was in effect abducted while attempting to transit at jfk airport
5655275 the administration has argued that the president has unilateral executive power in the war on terror to violate even criminal laws and when it has been challenged on that assertion it has argued that the courts cant even rule on that assertion of power because the alleged criminal violation is a state secret
5655276 provide a systematic approach to the privilege and thereby bring stability predictability and clarity to this area of the law and restore the public trust in government and the courts
5655277 the power to proceed because its structures and procedures violate both the uniform code of military justice and the four geneva conventions signed in 1949
5655278 the film changed my life and my way of thinking i decided to do whatever i could
5655279 when i learned of their problem i decided to do something at least help them dig wells in their area which would provide a perennial source of water
5655280 when she expressed a desire to help people in rural maharashtra we decided to encourage her
5655281 she always had an inclination toward social service and we decided to cultivate it
5655282 the drive began in july and by the end of the month a total of 2600 was collected this money was sufficient to dig a bore well as well as fit an electric pump
5655283 i want to build rural maharashtra i want medical attention to be available to everyone and make physicians available in every village in rural maharashtra
5655284 how have safety concerns and new warnings affected the anemia market
5655285 m amp a activity in the eastern european telecoms markets should continue to be intensive for the coming 18 months apart from long pending privatizations such as that of telekom srbija we expect a range of start up operations from the current wave of cdma and wimax license tenders these start ups are often backed by financial investors and will eventually become the object of transactions
5655286 as market growth slows down competitive intensity increases putting pressure on operating margins we can therefore expect that in the midterm telecommunications operators in eastern europe will face increasing pressure to consolidate in an ambition to realize cost savings or to simply take a competitor off the market operators that are currently benefiting from many years of strong revenue growth will start to feel the pressure to realize savings by taking over others we can therefore expect a new wave of cross border and intranational mergers in eastern europe as we have been observing in western europe for several years already
5655287 i eventually decided to quit without creating a fuss in the supreme national interest
5655288 musharraf had lost his utility as a useful asset for the war on terror
5655289 the americans had been putting pressure on islamabad since february for him to get its act together against the taliban and al qaeda and pakistans foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi and pakistans ambassador to washington husain haqqani always told washington that the government could not move forward independently because of musharraf
5655290 hence musharraf was politely told by washington through various channels to gracefully resign but he remained defiant and ultimately washington pulled its support of him and the ruling coalition moved for his impeachment which forced him to resign
5655291 the army will play the same role it played from 1996 to 1998
5655292 the american role has always been paramount in pakistans politics the late general zia ul haq was defiant of washingtons interests and he faced an accidental death in a mysterious plane accident in 1988 had musharraf tried to exercise his constitutional powers to dissolve the assemblies he would also have been obstructing american interests in the region and would have faced a zia like fate
5655293 now the americans will have to use the two remaining national assets for their interests the political parties and the army chief kiani washington abhors nawaz sharif so they will distance themselves from him and focus on asif zardari the widower of benazir bhutto and head of the ppp
5655294 zardari because of corruption cases that have been leveled against him can be easily manipulated and therefore he will act obediently on their advice
5655295 i suspect that kiani is already part of their game
5655296 yes he could be the one but asfandyar failed to uphold his promised role to control militancy in the tribal areas without resort to military operations
5655297 in my opinion nawab attaullah mengal a baloch politician should be the president of the country given the recent mistreatments done in balochistan province in the name of military operations
5655298 there was no reason to use such brute force in a tribal area like bajaur
5655299 the only reason for such military action was to destroy the talibans approaches to kunar where american forces are all out to get the taliban kunar province lies in the northeast and connects to kabul previously the taliban were focused only on southeastern provinces
5655300 this is the role washington wants the pakistani army to play the cost is paid by pakistanis and 250 000 people were displaced during the bajaur operation
5655301 due to the repeated defeats inflicted upon them by the iraqi army
5655302 the middle east will remain as a center of developments and crises so long as the royal regimes in the gulf remain in place and conflicts will not be resolved without the disappearance of these traditional regimes
5655303 sanctions have not isolated us instead we have become more independent
5655304 iranian scientists are always reaching new peaks in scientific and technological progress the successful launch of saffir shows that iran has access to the ultra modern technology required to manufacture launch and track satellites as well as transmit and receive information from them
5655305 while our athletes are making gold we are losing silver
5655306 the impact on the market of these regulatory measures perhaps except for the stamp duty cut is not direct and immediate
5655307 so impatient and desperate investors simply took them as a good opportunity to sell out the market had been expecting more direct moves by the government ahead of the olympics
5655308 the confidence of us small investors is built on our trust in the government now there is no sign that the government will take action so what we can do is leave the market
5655309 while the p e ratio now is as low as 19 if profits of listed companies drop significantly in the second half of this year it will go up again
5655310 see chinas masses rise up and buy stocks asia times online may 9 2007
5655311 there is great interest in growing your own food so you know whats in it or on it and avoid high prices at the grocery store
5655312 economists say canadian labor force drop shows job boom is over
5655313 55 200 canadian jobs disappeared in july the largest monthly drop since the early 1990s the unemployment rate actually shrank dropping a tenth of a point to 6 1 as an even larger number of people more than 74 000 of them dropped out of the labor force during the month
5655314 edged up by two ticks to 7 4 while in ontario the rate fell to 6 4 from 6 7 in june as 42 000 people left the labor market
5655315 mom was right you are a terrible worthless lazy father who doesnt care about us
5655316 i could have told you that you stupid damned kids
5655317 a gain of nearly 30 000 public sector positions partially offset the loss of 95 000 in the private sector
5655318 since july of 2007 employment in the public sector has grown by 6 1 compared with plus 0 5 for the private sector
5655319 do you really believe that present inflation is demand driven
5655320 that monetary policy is the root cause of the recent increase in the relative prices of energy and food
5655321 dismisses the critical non monetary factors including increasing commodity demand from strong capacity growth of the global economy coupled with short run supply constraints and various government distortions
5655322 then ask them hey how would you like a new car
5655323 and so you can also forget about capacity growth too because without the money to fuel the demand growth there aint no stinking capacity growth and thus there wont be any short run supply constraints although there will always be various government distortions
5655324 the blurring of lines between the military political and the humanitarian community is a real not an imaginary concern
5655325 we are all concerned that this is having an impact and many ngos are now traveling in unmarked cars trying to look as much like the normal population as possible earlier ngo workers were attacked when they were in the wrong place at the wrong time now we are being targeted
5655326 nowhere else in the world has such a step being taken
5655327 the guidelines will prevent a blurring of the lines between the role of the military and humanitarian actors preventing humanitarian space from being squeezed further
5655328 recognizing the distinct role that we have to play will be a vital component of protecting our impartiality and opening up humanitarian space for us
5655329 establish principles and practices for constructive civilian military relations and for effective coordination which is critical for achieving security and stability in afghanistan
5655330 intended to support the development of a relationship between military and humanitarian actors in which differences are recognized and respected
5655331 maintaining a clear distinction between the role and function of humanitarian actors from that of the military is a determining factor in creating an operating environment in which humanitarian organizations can discharge their responsibilities both effectively and safely
5655332 sustained humanitarian access to the affected population may be ensured when it is independent of military and political action
5655333 the overall humanitarian assistance effort in afghanistan is best served through a division of responsibilities government and humanitarian actors have the primary role of providing humanitarian assistance and the military is primarily responsible for providing security and if necessary basic infrastructure and urgent reconstruction assistance limited to gap filling measures until civilian organizations are able to takeover
5655334 given the significant involvement of prts in civilian affairs and in civil military liaison
5655335 real test will be how well they are implemented on the ground for example the prts and military actors ceasing the use of emergency relief for political and military objectives which undermines the perceptions of ngos being neutral
5655336 many afghans want security there is no evidence that prts engaging in relief or development activities is creating security why cant the prts and military stick to what they do best security and well stick to what we do best prts are even engaging in basic service provision in areas where ngos and government are already working at a minimum if ngos and government can operate then there is certainly no need for the prts to be doing this
5655337 this document is not perfect and it is not meant to state what the military can or cannot do everyone has had to make compromises
5655338 emergency and development aid is being used as a military and political incentive
5655339 this confuses peoples perceptions of who we are what we do and why we are doing it we deliver aid based on the needs of the population and to those who are most vulnerable not based on politics or military aims
5655340 need for clear separation between the military and the civilian actors necessary to enable aid agencies to assist people in need
5655341 international military actors increased involvement in relief and reconstruction is further complicating the operational environment for ngos particularly in terms of security
5655342 humanitarian space in afghanistan has been compromised by the military and private sector companies trying to do the same work as long term humanitarian workers some of them have very little if any humanitarian experience yet they think they can just turn up and do what we do just as well
5655343 the military should not be in the business of providing water and sanitation distribution of food and non food items nutrition programs health clinics and programs building schools and education programs the principle is called last resort when the military steps in when no one else can do it to provide life saving assistance not for some political or military purpose but in large parts of afghanistan the military is stepping in where other actors are already doing it
5655344 i think it is very important that prts do not involve themselves in humanitarian assistance unless there is absolutely no other alternative for security reasons i also think it is very important that the prts do not describe what they are generally doing as humanitarian
5655345 this is an extraordinary exchange loss and where the gain goes im not sure
5655346 we are not getting the full value of dollars donated for emergency relief and donors are extremely worried and keen to see that this issue is resolved
5655347 humanitarian agencies are now invited to transfer payments to us dollar accounts of vendors for supplies and services
5655348 we hope that the dialogue and cooperation built up in the last couple of months over the cyclone nargis response can be continued and improved and in the future extended to other humanitarian issues as well
5655349 we cant really read so we didnt understand what your email said

5655353 brilliantly shot and undeniably creepy deliriously sick sleazy and gory with some kickass action
5655354 this beautifully shot classic is immensely entertaining thanks to a combination of outrageous swordplay and richly gruesome and bizarre imagery
5655355 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5655356 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5655357 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it

5655363 video content is everywhere and for media professionals the quality of the content directly reflects the organization ateme understands that superb quality is a must for this industry with h 264 emerging as a universal codec for both broadcast and online video i believe the expertise ateme delivers will continue to lead and grow its business within new media markets
5655364 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
5655365 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
5655366 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5655367 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
5655368 oats are only fit to be fed to horses and scotsmen
5655369 and england has the finest horses and scotland the finest men
5655370 maize soon became popular in northern italy resolving the feeding problems of mountainous folk in those pre tourism times when dried corn ground and turned into a satisfying gruel helped them through snowbound winters without ski lifts and visitors from the city
5655371 noninvasive approaches offer substantial market potential in liver disease diagnostics
5655372 never before has ea had such a diverse and powerful slate of offerings and its been great to see consumer and critical response to our games
5655373 as more and more people come into interactive entertainment we are ready with the best games in sports action casual horror simulation and online well be bringing more new games to market this year than in our history and leipzig is a great european window to showcase those offerings for the broad range of people that love to play them
5655374 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5655375 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5655376 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5655377 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5655378 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5655379 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
5655380 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
5655381 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5655382 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5655383 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5655384 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability

5655388 comet in gaul so vast that the whole sky seemed on fire
5655389 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
5655390 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
5655391 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
5655392 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
5655393 jesus dann fragt jesus was und der hauptdarsteller ist verwirrt das geht dann eine weile so sehr lustig auf spanisch
5655394 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5655395 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5655396 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5655397 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5655398 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
5655399 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5655400 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5655401 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5655402 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5655403 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5655404 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5655405 give me my little niche and i will give you yours
5655406 most important and consistent spokesman of the idea of neocatastrophism in contemporary paleontology
5655407 faunal discontinuities involve not just the dying out of old but also the more or less sudden emergence of new phyla this phenomenon can no longer be successfully accommodated under the term catastrophe in the true meaning of the word it should rather be described as anastrophe
5655408 good conditions of preservation existed even for the most delicate soft bodied organisms in the precambrian
5655409 given a more or less even mutation rate and natural selection as a cause in evolution there is difficulty both in accounting for the early and relatively rapid phases of evolution giving rise to major groups and also for the great decline in this phenomenon in later geological time
5655410 changes in organic forms have nothing to do with external factors
5655411 sudden appearance of a highly developed fauna in the cambrian
5655412 the earliest and most primitive known members of every order already have the basic ordinal characters and in no case is an approximately continuous sequence from one to another known
5655413 under the very best circumstances morphological and stratigraphically graded transitions between classes and subclasses have been found at the level of phyla and higher categories any information on transitions as far as the fossil record is concerned is essentially non existent
5655414 furthermore each species must be exceedingly viable in order to survive long enough to give rise to some evolved descendent
5655415 unfortunately the origins of most higher categories are shrouded in mystery commonly new higher categories appear abruptly in the fossil record without evidence of transitional forms
5655416 within certain of the dying families of upper cretaceous ammonites an increase in size and the presence of bizarre looking forms may be noted this is a common accompaniment of extinctions of many groups
5655417 much more than 50 percent of evolution occurs through sudden events in which polymorphs and species are proliferated
5655418 on the divide between the precambrian and the cambrian there was a relatively sudden and thorough going transformation of the animal kingdom in which durable hard parts were deposited for the first time
5655419 the dinosaurs represent only one aspect of the much wider extinction process and the profound change in the composition of the faunas
5655420 it is beyond the capacity of forces within the crust of the earth to produce global catastrophe on this time scale
5655421 certainly no fact in the long history of the world is so startling as the wide and repeated extermination of its inhabitants
5655422 since faunal discontinuities are universal phenomena they must arise from universally active causes this has compelled me to look for agencies that would 1 have worldwide effects and 2 could extend to the totality of biotopes in the sea on dry lands in freshwater and in the air as well as to stocks of most varied habitats and ways of life
5655423 a connection between the faunal discontinuities and the migration of radioactive elements
5655424 the resistance of insects to radioactive radiation is about ten times greater than that of human beings and other organisms
5655425 iridium rich layers marking the end of the cretaceous period have now been found at more than two dozen locations around the world
5655426 having inhabited the oceans since some 50 million years before man made his first appearance
5655427 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5655428 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5655429 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
5655430 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
5655431 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
5655432 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
5655433 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
5655434 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
5655435 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5655436 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5655437 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
5655438 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5655439 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5655440 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5655441 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5655442 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5655443 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5655444 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5655445 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
5655446 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
5655447 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
5655448 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
5655449 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
5655450 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
5655451 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
5655452 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
5655453 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
5655454 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
5655455 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
5655456 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5655457 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5655458 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5655459 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5655460 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5655461 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5655462 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5655463 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5655464 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5655465 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5655466 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5655467 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5655468 nothing on earth more evil than a human educated as 1 when composed of opposites that cancel out as an entity
5655469 but how on earth else would one determine what is ethnically scottish other than by the ethnic scots
5655470 as pointed out lowland scots is irrelevant with regard to ethnic scottishness genetics as previously pionted out is irrelevant being interested in genetics does not make one a racist but tying undue importance to it serves no purpose other than either phony ethnicism or that of a racist cause
5655471 you obviously do need to be told how to be taken seriously if you are putting forward unproven theories which few would take seriously to support your own arguments
5655472 religion is utterly irrelevant here though it might be different if the american presbyterian population maintained worship with gaelic psalms and other truly scottish features
5655473 millions of people in the uk have names of a norman origin does that make them norman of course it doesnt have a surname which is macanything doesnt make you scottish and only a fantasist would claim otherwise it doesnt matter how closely one can trace their roots to scotland unless one is in posession of scottish language and culture which is clearly not the case with the vast majority of those claiming scottish ethnicity or descent
5655474 you speak the language and are in possession of its culture
5655475 agreed that behavioural traits do tend to outlast langauge but they are comparatively insignificant and do not long outlast the loss of language and of culture social behavioural characteristics are defined by the society and culture into which one is born and raised and there is no surviving scottish society in the usa
5655476 to discuss something as unverifiable as this is utterly meaningless while qualifying ethnicity on the basis of something tangible like language is the only meaningful way of classing ethnicity
5655477 you also cant say that the scots were native and the anglo saxons werent
5655478 according to you i supppose the only true ethnic scots are the irish since you apparently refute the cultural influences of the lowland anglo saxon scots and the blending of the cultures of scotland
5655479 in terms of ancestry you have some very controversial opinions and are largely your own pov
5655480 these claims are ridculous and not backed up by anything other than your ethnocentric opinions huh kinda reminds me of how you described my pov
5655481 anyways who are you to decide what is irrelevant and what isnt
5655482 are you the divine creator of scotland and the world
5655483 genetics can be of great value to studying ethnic groups as it again reveals origins possible shared history with other groups as well as the impact of invasions settlements of other peoples on an ethnic group
5655484 you are also claiming that the egyptians are merely arabs and dont have a unique ethnic identity this is ridculous and the influence of the ancient egyptians cant just be limited to physical genetic chacteristics because egyptians do have a quite distinct identity within the larger arab world
5655485 those norman names go back 1 000 years and the normans were few in number when they conquered britain and just as with the normans in sicily were absorbed by the british population
5655486 i mean under your current classification all 200 million or so americans and however million more people out there from australia canada wherever are all ethnic english because their native tongue and in most cases only language as well many cultural traits is english or anglo saxon based
5655487 the millions of italians and greeks around the world who are very pround of their culture and identity but dont speak their mother tongue arent ethnic italians or greeks
5655488 l of the recent immigrants and descendants of immigrants from the asian sub continent africa carribean etc in the uk who only speak english or in rare cases welsh are only ethnic scottish welsh or english
5655489 you should however put yourself in my shoes or the shoes of any american canadian brazilian australian etc
5655490 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5655491 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5655492 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5655493 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5655494 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5655495 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
5655496 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
5655497 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
5655498 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
5655499 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
5655500 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
5655501 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5655502 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5655503 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5655504 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5655505 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5655506 although surely the worst the bush administration is not the first nor will it be the last administration to mistreat and misuse science and scientists
5655507 these special interest groups are being given access at the highest level
5655508 government scientists have had their findings subjected to censorship and misrepresentation
5655509 the public and congress have often been deprived of accurate and candid scientific information
5655510 the pursuit of science in an open society has had a long and fruitful tradition in america
5655511 unfortunately this tradition has been violated in recent years by the government itself
5655512 if you say low doses of radiation arent bad for you or that global warming is due to variations in the sun you cant get funded
5655513 god is in his heaven and but for the evil acts of the chosen scapegoat all would be right with the world
5655514 580 ad in louraine one morning before the dawning of the day a great light was seen crossing the heavens falling toward the east a sound like that of a tree crashing down was heard over all the countryside but it could surely not have been any tree since it was heard more than fifty miles away the city of bordeaux was badly shaken by an earthquake a supernatural fire burned down villages about bordeaux it took hold so rapidly that houses and even threshing floors with all their grain were burned to ashes since there was absolutely no other visible cause of the fire it must have happened by divine will the city of orleans also burned with so great a fire that even the rich lost almost everything
5655515 a large mass of fire appeared over the vessel completely blinding the spectators and as it fell into the sea some 50 yards to leeward it caused a hissing sound which was heard above the blast and made the vessel quiver from stem to stem hardly had this disappeared when a lowering mass of white foam was seen rapidly approaching the vessel the noise from the advancing volume of water is described as deafening the barque was struck flat aback but before there was time to touch a brace the sails had filled again and the roaring white sea had passed ahead
5655516 fell into the water very close alongside the vessel with a roar and caused the sea to make tremendous breakers which swept over the vessel
5655517 rushed across the sky like a rocket the next moment it passed over the topmast of the liner with a tremendous roar and plowed up the sea about fifty yards from the boat the upheaval of the water was terrific but the ship was not damaged
5655518 unless one is willing to postulate freezing temperatures across the equator such an explanation clearly begs the question
5655519 sudden death is indicated by the robust condition of the animals and their full stomachs the animals were robust and healthy when they died
5655520 the pleistocene period ended in death this was no ordinary extinction of a vague geological period which fizzled to an uncertain end this death was catastrophic and all inclusive
5655521 until recently the astronomical mainstream was highly critical of clube and napiers giant comet hypothesis however the crash of comet shoemaker levy 9 on jupiter in 1994 has led to a change in attitudes the comet watched by the worlds observatories was seen split into 20 pieces and slammed into different parts of the planet over a period of several days a similar impact on earth it hardly needs saying would have been devastating
5655522 the forest beneath the blast would have ignited suddenly burning until the impacts blast wave shut down the conflagration
5655523 dust may have been blown into the stratosphere where it would have been transported around the globe easily the region must have been devastated for decades
5655524 portentous and protracted eclipses of the sun occur such as the one after the murder of caesar the dictator
5655525 dry fogs crop failures famines in china and the mediterranean and plagues
5655526 however he could not long remain on account of the pestilence which nearly destroyed the whole nation it was called the yellow pestilence because it occasioned all persons who were seized by it to be yellow and without blood and it appeared to men a column of a watery cloud having one end trailing along the ground and the other above proceeding in the air and passing through the whole country like a shower going through the bottom of valleys whatever living creatures it touched with its pestiferous blast either immediately died or sickened for death and so greatly did the aforesaid destruction rage throughout the nation that it caused the country to be nearly deserted
5655527 the dehumanization of woman has got to stop just look at necro and that poor woman
5655528 i act a child because it is justified by children doing the same
5655529 i act a child because it is justified by children doing the same
5655530 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5655531 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5655532 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5655533 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5655534 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5655535 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5655536 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
5655537 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
5655538 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
5655539 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
5655540 we all sort of naturally fell into the roles that we played
5655541 i felt definitely like the house mom at times i had to crack the whip
5655542 arent all women lesbians these days bisexual swingers isnt that all the rage
5655543 pax is jam packed wall to wall with passionate game fans we are incredibly honored to be featured there at nintendos booth its a fantastic opportunity for us to receive input and feedback directly from other gamers
5655544 we are honored and overjoyed to have our efforts recognized to be acknowledged by the industry news media shows that the hard work of our team has not gone unnoticed and only strengthens our resolve to continue to push our game play graphics and the technical boundaries of the hardwares capabilities
5655545 we wanted to do something really different with the house of the dead overkill
5655546 with sega weve been able to create a fresh look for the franchise i think youll agree its like nothing youve seen before on wii
5655547 paying homage to the pulp horror comics and films that inspired generations of gore fans the house of the dead overkill will expose gamers to a brand new fleshy rollercoaster ride of revolting dismemberment
5655548 this is the hardcore wii title youve been waiting for
5655549 that was the emotion that came naturally because i spent a lot of time preparing for this moment and i just couldnt hold back my tears
5655550 you cant really see outside the bottle because you exist inside of it
5655551 i hope the international community will show itself fully ready capable and willing to help provide critically needed assistance to the people of georgia

5655598 we must provide special assistance to areas and to workers displaced by cuts in the defense budget and by other unavoidable economic dislocations
5655599 and again i will say we must do this together i pledge to you that i will do my best to see that business and labor and government work together for a change
5655600 but all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail let me say this again i feel so strongly about this all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail unless we also take this year not next year not 5 years from now but this year bold steps to reform our health care system
5655601 in 1992 we spent 14 percent of our income on health care more than 30 percent more than any other country in the world and yet we were the only advanced nation that did not provide a basic package of health care benefits to all of its citizens
5655602 the combination of the rising cost of care and the lack of care and the fear of losing care are endangering the security and the very lives of millions of our people
5655603 later this spring after the first lady and the many good people who are helping her all across the country complete their work i will deliver to congress a comprehensive plan for health care reform that finally will bring costs under control and provide security to all of our families so that no one will be denied the coverage they need but so that our economic future will not be compromised either
5655604 let me further say that i want to work with all of you on this
5655605 perhaps the most fundamental change the new direction i propose offers is its focus on the future and its investment which i seek in our children

5655789 we have got trouble with the kids they come and sit in front of the window sometimes they shout at my door and run away they come inside and squirt the sauces at us and when they stay inside sometimes my customers are disturbed and they dont want to come again my regular customers the families i maybe lose 150 200 a week because of that

5655802 we were made aware of a problem with edinburgh youth orchestra string ensemble summer concert which takes place this thursday the technical fault was identified and tickets were immediately returned to sale
5655803 tickets for the concert were being bought through the fringe box office on saturday so we believe the problem only caused difficulties for ticket buyers on sunday
5655804 discussions are ongoing between our officials and lothian buses but we are hopeful of reaching some sort of compromise
5655805 we cant find the 300 000 originally suggested but we are looking to see if there is any other way money can be squeezed out of other areas to help the situation
5655806 it is critical that the city finds a way of ensuring that these cuts are not implemented
5655807 these services are absolutely vital for large parts of this city and if they are taken away then many people simply dont have any other choices
5655808 if they can find the best part of 1 3m for flags then i think they can find some money to keep these services going
5655809 the board meeting has been held and our response is with the council
5655810 why as a once celtic supporter with its strong catholic irish allegiances should i cheer on a team known to attract extreme protestants well religio
5655811 i deplore the bigotry of sectarianism that still blights soccer in scotland especially in clashes between celtic who field the emerald green of catholic ireland against the blue of protestant rangers lets have the referee raise the red card to all bigots be they blue or green and send such mindless prejudice off the field for ever
5655812 of course i wanted to be clearly understood i practised articulating my words more distinctly yet at the same time i wanted to retain the personality of my own voice and to be honest to my edinburgh roots
5655813 the scheme will invest around 200m to transform this site into hotels offices retail and leisure uses
5655814 because of the councils interest in the site final determination rests with scottish ministers and i await this with interest
5655815 this was just daft if the council had carried out a proper consultation in the first place then none of this would have happened
5655816 the council says it did carry out a consultation when this was first suggested a few years ago but a couple of notices tied to a lamp post is not really good enough
5655817 that section of the road is far too narrow for a bus stop of that nature the biggest problem with the new bus stop was that it jutted out so far into the road that traffic has been struggling to get past stopping buses
5655818 the problem is that nobody really knew about the plans until it was too late and it was only when they saw it getting built that it was obvious it would cause problems
5655819 it maybe says something about the way this council consults people but we are where we are
5655820 this was just not a good site for one of these bus boarders and there would have been too much traffic building up not to mention that you can hardly fit two buses past each other at that point
5655821 there are good points for these build out bus stops in terms of improved wheelchair access but they got it wrong this time and im glad to see that being recognised
5655822 the councils then executive approved the eastern corridor bus priority scheme at its meeting on july 31 2007
5655823 the approved scheme included re designing the road layout to provide a bus shelter in newhaven road at the location in question
5655824 we have listened to local peoples current concerns that the new pavement layout could cause delays to local traffic and in consultation with the ward councillors we have decided to change the design
5655825 i am delighted to welcome john bury to the position of head of planning
5655826 this is an important role for the city and it attracted a strong shortlist of candidates
5655827 theres been nothing too dramatic overnight but there is heavy rain around
5655828 this community has been the most successful in scotland in matching what was community regeneration funding pound for pound so that gives you some indication of the scale of the problem we are facing
5655829 whether through inexperience or a lack of knowledge and understanding of the potential implications wrong decisions have been made
5655830 it is time for the politicians to wake up and give some direction to this sorry state of affairs
5655831 we are concerned that services in forth will effectively be cut by 800 000 not exactly fair
5655832 there has been much discussion on this matter over the last few months but misinformation and distortion of the facts has created a great deal of disquiet and unnecessary anxiety
5655833 the index used to judge funding identifies areas and pockets of deprivation across the city not only in areas which have traditionally been identified as disadvantaged
5655834 i appreciate that this period of transition and refocusing of activities is difficult for some existing projects
5655835 i worry when so called experts dont actually know what they are trying to achieve looking at this debacle you can understand why
5655836 your work is beautiful but your voice is too english
5655837 completely understood that i loved my country as much as he loved his
5655838 douglas never once asked me where i cast my vote it was an uncrossed boundary
5655839 even at the very end of his life douglas was harrowed by his sense of failure to live long enough to see independence realised
5655840 it was then in the last few hours together that i promised him that in the forthcoming election for the scottish parliament i would vote snp and that his lifetime endeavour would have my continuing support
5655841 i was very conscious this was an issue when i was the minister and we always took a strong line on attacks on staff and that was backed up by this act
5655842 unfortunately it is being shown to be a very necessary piece of legislation
5655843 the important thing is to send out a very strong message that it is unacceptable and back that up with strong legal measures
5655844 some of it can be explained by the fact some people under a lot of stress will act in uncharacteristic ways and hit out at whoever is next to them
5655845 on other occasions like people attacking fire engines its just mindless stupidity
5655846 every public service professional deserves protection from threatening or abusive behaviour
5655847 they said they couldnt make an announcement while there is a game on
5655848 what i dont understand is how come they can announce car registration numbers during the game but cant call for someone whos just lost a family member i just think it was out of order
5655849 i hope nothing serious ever happens to anyones relatives while the game is on what happens if someones teenage son is in a car accident and someone wants to get hold of them in the stadium are they going to be told no the games only 54 minutes in
5655850 our seats are just a few rows from the front so my husband went up to one of the security staff explained and asked if they could make an announcement for my dad over the speaker she checked with someone on her radio then told us they couldnt make an announcement while the game was still on
5655851 we walked round to the west stand and the woman at reception was very understanding but because we didnt know exactly where my dad was sitting no one could go and get him we had to sit and wait for him to come out at the end of the match
5655852 the club is saddened to hear the news about the familys loss and have communicated with the family to offer sincere condolences
5655853 the club has procedures in place to provide pa announcements during matches and is currently liaising with the relevant stewarding company to consider the circumstances surrounding saturdays events
5655854 its a very busy branch and its not as if this post office is losing money for them
5655855 customers would have to go to newington and they wont be able to cope because it will be too busy with all our customers too
5655856 this branch is handy for people because it is on the bus route
5655857 there is also sheltered housing right in front of us
5655858 all we can do now is try to fight it
5655859 reducing the hours of these post offices tantamount to closure will cause great difficulty to those who rely on the services available at branches particularly the elderly and disabled
5655860 there is still time to save these post office services
5655861 taking the decision to close any post office branch is always very difficult and we know will cause concern to many of our customers
5655862 we want to ensure that everyone who uses relies on or has any concern with post office services is both fully aware of the proposed changes and able to give views on them
5655863 we believe these proposals offer the best prospect for a sustainable way forward for post office services in edinburgh the lothians and south of scotland bearing in mind the minimum access criteria and the other factors to which we have to have regard
5655864 as the councils main opposition political group our focus will now be renewed on holding the current snp lib dem administration to account
5655865 only in the last few weeks we have seen that administration cut school budgets abandon nursery school hot meals reduce the funding for numerous voluntary organisations and cut community centre full time workers
5655866 at the same time money is being spent on ceremonial flags for the city and refurbishing desks and chairs for councillors meetings these are simply the wrong priorities for edinburgh
5655867 the rock trust makes such a difference to the lives of so many disadvantaged young people across the lothians so im delighted to support their work
5655868 we are absolutely delighted with the number of causes nominated as part of together we make a difference week
5655869 the event was a fantastic way to celebrate the foundations tenth birthday
5655870 six taliban were killed after they blew up the bombs they had on their bodies two children have been killed and two more along with a woman have been wounded
5655871 some of the bombers were able to blow themselves up outside the base and some have been killed by our forces
5655872 as young people start to become more independent they have to learn how to manage their condition themselves
5655873 this can be a difficult process and taking risks can sometimes have tragic consequences
5655874 at the moment specialist services for this age group are very limited
5655875 we hope that by finding out how it feels from a teenagers perspective we can get a clearer idea of what would help them manage and live with their condition
5655876 by offering more choice and convenience a more efficient service and through making use of sustainable design techniques this project makes sense for our passengers our business partners and for the environment
5655877 you guys know im a disappointed cynic when it comes to video games evoking subtle emotions in players
5655878 i love what i saw and if the whole game feels like the stuff i saw last week well wow just wow and the coolest thing to me is hell now im inspired to step up to the plate and try to do something a bit more meaningful as well maybe not with our current title but one day soon
5655879 its becoming more mainstream more chic actually to do music for kids we always make the joke that its amazing what happens when rock stars have kids
5655880 right now nothings changed i dont think hes coming over
5655881 who knows maybe hes changed his mind but weve had no indication of it
5655882 for all the praise lavished on him by washington mr musharraf was a far less effective ally than he was portrayed to be posing as the stalwart ally but doing far less then he claimed
5655883 in the end a new civilian government could prove at least as helpful perhaps even more so
5655884 theres a sense that origin has gotten quite a positive response on its csg monetization process but thats still in early days so its hard to decide which is a better option
5655885 theres a high chance they will wait until they get more details on the csg monetization proposals origin has received but they could also make a pre emptive strike and launch a higher offer
5655886 rear units as well as second and third echelon units are being pulled back first the vanguard units will be pulled back at the final stage
5655887 ensure russia does not learn the wrong lessons from the events of the last two weeks force cannot be the basis for the demarcation of new lines around russia
5655888 we have seen media reports indicating that people are being shot at while trying to leave the area
5655889 anyone who tries anything like that will face a crushing response
5655890 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5655891 hazel got banged by a bus hazel got banged by a bus
5655892 n s n o conseguimos chegar a um acordo nos termos de compensa o
5655893 its a big big two weeks for us the key is we get other players in and improve the team as we go along the market is loosening up and im hoping that players who might not have been available will now become available
5655894 the balance of the team isnt quite right at the moment and we also need players with premiership experience
5655895 ecb chief executive david collier was at the meeting and he will report back
5655896 they have a board meeting in london on tuesday to discuss the issue
5655897 the meeting with icc chief executive haroon lorgat lasted two hours and it was an opportunity for all the players to ask whatever questions they had about the tournament
5655898 david collier and hugh morris managing director of the england team were both there and they heard the views of all the players
5655899 in the past i always felt that the team was picked before we met up
5655900 but i dont think there are any automatic choices in the team any more and it doesnt matter who you play for if you are good enough you will get in fabio capello is very fair and you get the feeling that if you play well you will get in the team
5655901 its a very professional set up when you are with the squad and that is the way it should be i wouldnt say its frightening its an atmosphere of respect
5655902 its not like a boarding school its enjoyable and the coach will have banter with you his english is fairly good better than what you might think from watching him on the telly
5655903 this was always a game which people would look forward to and it should be a good game
5655904 we got a point the last time we played chelsea and im looking forward to playing against them again who knows we might get all three this time
5655905 in the dressing room he is always the same cheerful
5655906 in the past i always felt that the team was picked before we met up
5655907 but i dont think there are any automatic choices in the team any more and it doesnt matter who you play for if you are good enough you will get in fabio capello is very fair and you get the feeling that if you play well you will get in the team
5655908 its a very professional set up when you are with the squad and that is the way it should be i wouldnt say its frightening its an atmosphere of respect
5655909 its not like a boarding school its enjoyable and the coach will have banter with you
5655910 andy comes to us with considerable premier league experience for a player of his age
5655911 it just feels unbelievable its going to take a while to sink in but wow
5655912 i think that if the winds here had been a little bit stronger and the racing had been normal then i would have just sailed my race because i would have been more confident that i wasnt going to lose

5655927 the results from our initial phase 1 trial were quite good with over 90 percent of subjects achieving detectable immune responses against hiv after the prime boost vaccination we hope to improve the breadth and magnitude of immune responses in the next clinical trial by using the vaxfectin r adjuvant with our dna priming vaccine we believe that continued development of hiv vaccines remains among the worlds top healthcare priorities
5655928 a nys senator is doing what he can to get the drug banned
5655929 you stupid son of a bitch thats what i have been taking if it was helping me at all i would have never came in here in the first place
5655930 theres so many people concerned about me and who support me i feel very sorry but theres really nothing i could do
5655931 i didnt feel right when i was warming up before the race
5655932 i knew my foot would fail me i felt painful when i was just jogging
5655933 i wanted to hang on but i couldnt it was unbearable if i had finished the race i would have risked my tendon i could not describe my feeling at that moment
5655934 i know i have the ability once my foot recovered
5655935 now the most important thing is to heal my injury i still have a chance next year after all im still at the peak i must be optimistic and i shouldnt blame everyone and everything but not myself i will not easily give up
5655936 we all understand that liu quit the race due to injury
5655937 we hope he will relax and focus on recovery we hope that after he recovers he will continue to train hard and struggle harder for the national glory
5655938 it is the second biggest economy in the world and in 50 years it will be the biggest
5655939 starting with diefenbaker trudeau and all of us we established very good relations relatively speaking with china
5655940 and suddenly you break the bridge it would have been easy just to be there
5655941 he had to swallow himself whole and he went there the chinese are like that ok fine you dont like us were not buying french food
5655942 as a canadian i deplore the fact weve lost our position in the world
5655943 ask any businessman who goes to china and theyll tell you that
5655944 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5655945 canadian doctors believe in the fundamentals of access based on need not on the ability to pay
5655946 its important to acknowledge that there are lots of reforms that are needed in the system
5655947 no one in our organization is interested in defending the status quo weve got some real problems in our health care system
5655948 we need to be constantly advocating for the improvement of the public system

5655951 ha habido tres que han sido m s r pidos que yo y s lo queda felicitarlos
5655952 es peor quedar el 25 que el cuarto aunque lo importante son las medallas pero el deporte es as no son matem ticas

5655961 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5655962 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5655963 i think pakistan is looking for a fresh face one that doesnt carry the corruption allegations and the baggage that zardari and sharif are taking to the table
5655964 but we knew coming here we had the team that could do it if things went our way

5655968 the scheherazade of the sales rack unveils how to unearth haute looks for less and gives advice on dressing well from choosing tailors to finding bras
5655969 there is still no sign of a withdrawal nothing at all
5655970 i really do not know how long we will be staying here
5655971 we should send a signal that that the agreement between russia and georgia should be fulfilled and the russian troops should withdraw but i am also convinced we should have the possibility for dialogue
5655972 their troops only movement has been towards the georgian capital tbilisi
5655973 the russians are expected to be sent a strong message from nato foreign ministers meeting in brussels nato is set to back georgias territorial integrity and condemn russias military presence
5655974 we are going to send the message that we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the transatlantic structures like georgia and ukraine we are determined to deny them their strategic objective
5655975 youll see a nato more united than you might expect
5655976 we hope that decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era dmitry rogozin told reporters on monday
5655977 we dont want to hear that mikheil saakashvili is a saint
5655978 youll want to move along with charity or just listen to her appealing voice whether youre young or old encourage your kids to dance and make sure you join in the fun
5655979 brings new comfort and charm to your peace time living
5655980 i think it would be a benefit for the public to know when the committee is meeting and to be able to see the information as the committee meets that ultimately will be presented in a report
5655981 before i used to be very nervous and let it get to me now because ive competed in so many tournaments it doesnt get to me as much
5655982 when my dad found out we qualified for the olympics he supported me
5655983 my goal is to do my best and to get past that first round my preliminary will be my catapult to get me up
5655984 i wouldnt be here without some of the people back home now its my time to repay them
5655985 it makes me feel good because i get to represent these people who have been supporting me
5655986 this being in the olympics is something ill never forget
5655987 the technology asobo studios has developed to build fuel is ground breaking

5655999 the previous two years conferences have focussed primarily on the engineering aspects of rapid manufacturing although there were again some very technical presentations this year it also seemed to be a definite aim of the conference to look at how these technologies are breaking out of r amp d labs and getting into the hands of those exploring the design possibilities and the societal implications of rm
5656000 the french have suffered a major loss of life in what is being describe as a number of battles against the taliban
5656001 one specific incident was in the area of kabul which again will be a worrying thing for nato forces and for president karzai that the taliban are still strong enough to maintain this kind of attack and inflict these sort of casualities at a very sensitive time
5656002 their presence is afghanistan was recently beefed up by president
5656003 i think it will mirror something of the discussion in britian about the loss of life and the justification of that loss of life in a war that seems not to be going natos way
5656004 the taliban really do not give up despite the forces against them they appear to control more of the country given that they are able to strike with such force and with such loss of life so close to the capital
5656005 posturing to attack the base and engaged them with small arms fire
5656006 an agreement is shaping up around a toughening up of the language as regards russia notably over its failure to respect yesterdays deadline on the withdrawal something which has evidently created a consensus
5656007 ensure russia does not learn the wrong lessons from the events of the last two weeks
5656008 force cannot be the basis for the demarcation of new lines around russia
5656009 they entered the civilian port and kicked everyone out the russians arrested the port security staff 20 of them they are police officers
5656010 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti

5656032 i think it is absolutely regrettable that the leader of fiji has decided not to attend this forum rudd said today in auckland
5656033 it would have been far better for the leader of fiji to sit down with the leaders of the pacific island countries and answer to the commitments which have been previously given by fiji to fellow island states that is now not going to occur
5656034 we dont believe we can sit idly by while the principles of democracy are shredded and therefore the resolve of pacific island counties is to act in concert on this question he said

5656042 because every day in the premier league is an event every day is slightly different and we have to be ready for the big occasion

5656203 so all these other water system across the country add significant amounts of fluoride get the levels up to government standards but we just happen to have naturally occuring fluoride that meets the government standards exactly
5656204 in a sweetheart deal these phosphate companies are spared the expense of disposing of this fluosilicic acid in a toxic waste dump
5656205 bryson writes with the skill of a top selling novelist but it was not his convincing storytelling that made me finish the book it was the haunting message that possibly here again was another therapeutic agent fluoride that had not been thoroughly studied before it was foisted on the public as a panacea to protect or improve health
5656206 whether or not brysons nuclear bomb connection is ever confirmed without a doubt this book demonstrates that there is still much that needs to be considered about the continued use of fluorine in future production and technology the nuclear product that required the use of fluorine ultimately killed 65 000 people outright in one sortie over japan the actual number of others since then and in generations to come who will have had their health insidiously undermined by artificial exposure to fluorides and other fluorine chemicals with half lives estimated in geologic time may well exceed that of the atom bomb victims millions and millions of times over
5656207 this agency regards such use as an ideal environmental solution to a long standing problem by recovering by product fluosilicic acid from fertilizer manufacturing water and air pollution are minimized and water utilities have a low cost source of fluoride available to them

5656245 i dont walk all the circuits any more but on the new ones i will walk and try to do it with a scooter or a car
5656246 it helps a bit i think walking the circuit driving it and watching the footage is better than a simulator as it gives you a rough idea
5656247 weve got a few things we do simulators are a way to get your head around the track and then you calibrate all that into what we do
5656248 i have a partner who has lined up the money to do this and weve been kicking around on some stuff
5656249 bill davis is off on the numbers and had some bigger people chasing it the last time i talked to him i had the money but didnt get the documents that we requested
5656250 i just heard some of those quotes and i was pretty amazed by them weve continued to talk to danny weve talked to several people yes all weve ever talked about with anybody is the entire operation
5656251 we wouldnt be talking about that in public its not to that stage yet that would be a question for danny what his plan is
5656252 mummy is going to have to take him out and flush him down the toilet to make him better
5656253 unfortunately fishy is dead so we are going to have to send him down the toilet
5656254 i think it is absolutely regrettable that the leader of fiji has decided not to attend this forum rudd said today in auckland
5656255 it would have been far better for the leader of fiji to sit down with the leaders of the pacific island countries and answer to the commitments which have been previously given by fiji to fellow island states that is now not going to occur
5656256 we dont believe we can sit idly by while the principles of democracy are shredded and therefore the resolve of pacific island counties is to act in concert on this question he said
5656257 in our consultations with our fellow heads of government from the pacific island countries we are confronted front and centre with the impact of climate change on regional states rudd said
5656258 even if compliance poses an incidental conflict with the defendants religious beliefs
5656259 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity
5656260 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim
5656261 it appears at this point that dc district chief famolare begins to doctor shop
5656262 following that appointment dr mahoney then signs off on dc famolares paperwork declaring him totally disabled

5656265 il est absolument clair que la russie doit tenir les engagements pris par le pr sident medvedev et les tenir imm diatement

5656268 if a person who has had a stroke can walk across a room i should be able to run 20 miles
5656269 when you run you delve a little deeper into yourself and empathize when they hit their wall and think i just cant do it
5656270 he is aging very gracefully healthy and smart much better than i did at his age he is national class
5656271 its training and leading up to a race for me
5656272 ive always had good pulmonary lung capacity its been my strength its carried me through a lot
5656273 it was kind of half hearted i was not prepared
5656274 i dont know exactly what it was that brought me back
5656275 thats a tough one a buddy of mine got me to run with him in the 2006 tucson 10 miler i did 1 07 and things snowballed from there
5656276 people who cant walk or dress themselves lots of stroke victims amputees hip fractures
5656277 we have handed the case to the police and also submitted our findings to our disciplinary board
5656278 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5656279 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at us 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
5656280 especially since there is a clear lack of buying momentum
5656281 i think it is absolutely regrettable that the leader of fiji has decided not to attend this forum rudd said today in auckland
5656282 it would have been far better for the leader of fiji to sit down with the leaders of the pacific island countries and answer to the commitments which have been previously given by fiji to fellow island states that is now not going to occur

5656285 its a very impressive building absolutely magnificent it could have been seen for miles around
5656286 there is little risk of the economy falling into a major downturn
5656287 sluggish against the backdrop of high energy and materials prices and weaker growth in exports
5656288 we need to be mindful of both upside and downside risks

5656327 i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps
5656328 the pipeline of opportunities is improving and the board is confident about tribals prospects for the reminder of 2008 and beyond
5656329 finding good viable sites that fit in with our style of trading remains challenging but we are ideally placed to cope with additional stores
5656330 the airport will also waive landing fees entirely for all scheduled flights for december through the first two months of 2009 were extremely seasonal and its common for airlines to drop service in winter and pick up in spring airport spokeswoman lisa bourcier says any airline that starts non stop service to any international destination will also be exempt from landing fees and terminal rents while the program lasts
5656331 last year was a record breaking year for the airport driven primarily by spirit airlines expansion in the market
5656332 numbers will likely continue to drop once schedule cuts announced earlier this summer by united airlines and delta air lines go into effect later this year
5656333 credits spreads especially in the financial sphere may remain vulnerable to upside pressure
5656334 and this will only reinforce the vulnerability of this bear market rally in equities
5656335 are trying to scale back on the financial services side
5656336 there is a very tight link between the direction of credit spreads 88 correlation and the performance of the equity market
5656337 unfortunately a close inspection of obamas proposals reveals something disquieting he would raise marginal tax rates for many middle income taxpayers a bad move for anyone seeking to promote economic growth
5656338 the key point that brill and viard neglect to note or discuss is that even in their cherry picked example higher marginal tax rates bring along offsetting benefits to families with lower and middle incomes
5656339 virtually the whole government debt story is due to projections of exploding health care costs
5656340 what pretense to assert as did kenneth griffin recipient last year of more than 1 billion in compensation as manager of the citadel investment group that the current income distribution has to stand if the tax became too high as a matter of principle i would not be working this hard right far better to admit as has warren buffett that the tax rates of the wealthiest americans average nearly 15 while those of their salaried and therefore less incentivized assistants just outside their offices are nearly twice that
5656341 so the major themes of these two plans are in the case of senator mccains plan that the major emphasis is on economic efficiency cuts in marginal tax rates improves economic incentives
5656342 in the case of obamas plan the goal is primarily to improve progressivity to lower tax burdens on low income people and raise them on higher income people
5656343 they didnt really say anything that new but they kind of reminded us that were not out of the woods yet on the financial sector
5656344 a lot of people have thought over the course of last fewweeks that much of the bad news regarding markets is out in thepublic domain that clearly is not the case
5656345 we saw the comments from rogoff suggesting that a majoru s bank could well go under that just reawakens investors tothe idea that we are by no means over the worst of the crisis

5656370 i always knew though not by official documents and information kept from me about the existence of an agreement based on dont harm me and i wont harm you between the italian republic and organizations such as the popular front for the liberation of palestine pflp and the plo
5656371 was awarded an extraordinary capability for the direction of italian intelligence agencies and special forces after he received approval for the deal
5656372 according to the deal the palestinian organizations could establish bases in italy enjoyed freedom of movement when entering and exiting the country and could move around without undergoing mandatory security checks because they were protected by the secret service
5656373 during my time as interior minister i learned that plo people were holding heavy artillery in their homes and protected by diplomatic immunity as representatives of the arab league i was told not to worry and i managed to convince them to lay down their heavy artillery and make do with light weaponry

5656381 brilliantly shot and undeniably creepy deliriously sick sleazy and gory with some kickass action

5656383 oats are only fit to be fed to horses and scotsmen
5656384 and england has the finest horses and scotland the finest men
5656385 maize soon became popular in northern italy resolving the feeding problems of mountainous folk in those pre tourism times when dried corn ground and turned into a satisfying gruel helped them through snowbound winters without ski lifts and visitors from the city

5656392 give me my little niche and i will give you yours
5656393 most important and consistent spokesman of the idea of neocatastrophism in contemporary paleontology
5656394 faunal discontinuities involve not just the dying out of old but also the more or less sudden emergence of new phyla this phenomenon can no longer be successfully accommodated under the term catastrophe in the true meaning of the word it should rather be described as anastrophe
5656395 good conditions of preservation existed even for the most delicate soft bodied organisms in the precambrian
5656396 given a more or less even mutation rate and natural selection as a cause in evolution there is difficulty both in accounting for the early and relatively rapid phases of evolution giving rise to major groups and also for the great decline in this phenomenon in later geological time
5656397 changes in organic forms have nothing to do with external factors
5656398 sudden appearance of a highly developed fauna in the cambrian
5656399 the earliest and most primitive known members of every order already have the basic ordinal characters and in no case is an approximately continuous sequence from one to another known
5656400 under the very best circumstances morphological and stratigraphically graded transitions between classes and subclasses have been found at the level of phyla and higher categories any information on transitions as far as the fossil record is concerned is essentially non existent
5656401 furthermore each species must be exceedingly viable in order to survive long enough to give rise to some evolved descendent
5656402 unfortunately the origins of most higher categories are shrouded in mystery commonly new higher categories appear abruptly in the fossil record without evidence of transitional forms
5656403 within certain of the dying families of upper cretaceous ammonites an increase in size and the presence of bizarre looking forms may be noted this is a common accompaniment of extinctions of many groups
5656404 much more than 50 percent of evolution occurs through sudden events in which polymorphs and species are proliferated
5656405 on the divide between the precambrian and the cambrian there was a relatively sudden and thorough going transformation of the animal kingdom in which durable hard parts were deposited for the first time
5656406 the dinosaurs represent only one aspect of the much wider extinction process and the profound change in the composition of the faunas
5656407 it is beyond the capacity of forces within the crust of the earth to produce global catastrophe on this time scale
5656408 certainly no fact in the long history of the world is so startling as the wide and repeated extermination of its inhabitants
5656409 since faunal discontinuities are universal phenomena they must arise from universally active causes this has compelled me to look for agencies that would 1 have worldwide effects and 2 could extend to the totality of biotopes in the sea on dry lands in freshwater and in the air as well as to stocks of most varied habitats and ways of life
5656410 a connection between the faunal discontinuities and the migration of radioactive elements
5656411 the resistance of insects to radioactive radiation is about ten times greater than that of human beings and other organisms
5656412 iridium rich layers marking the end of the cretaceous period have now been found at more than two dozen locations around the world
5656413 having inhabited the oceans since some 50 million years before man made his first appearance
5656414 although surely the worst the bush administration is not the first nor will it be the last administration to mistreat and misuse science and scientists
5656415 these special interest groups are being given access at the highest level
5656416 government scientists have had their findings subjected to censorship and misrepresentation
5656417 the public and congress have often been deprived of accurate and candid scientific information
5656418 the pursuit of science in an open society has had a long and fruitful tradition in america
5656419 unfortunately this tradition has been violated in recent years by the government itself
5656420 if you say low doses of radiation arent bad for you or that global warming is due to variations in the sun you cant get funded
5656421 god is in his heaven and but for the evil acts of the chosen scapegoat all would be right with the world
5656422 580 ad in louraine one morning before the dawning of the day a great light was seen crossing the heavens falling toward the east a sound like that of a tree crashing down was heard over all the countryside but it could surely not have been any tree since it was heard more than fifty miles away the city of bordeaux was badly shaken by an earthquake a supernatural fire burned down villages about bordeaux it took hold so rapidly that houses and even threshing floors with all their grain were burned to ashes since there was absolutely no other visible cause of the fire it must have happened by divine will the city of orleans also burned with so great a fire that even the rich lost almost everything
5656423 a large mass of fire appeared over the vessel completely blinding the spectators and as it fell into the sea some 50 yards to leeward it caused a hissing sound which was heard above the blast and made the vessel quiver from stem to stem hardly had this disappeared when a lowering mass of white foam was seen rapidly approaching the vessel the noise from the advancing volume of water is described as deafening the barque was struck flat aback but before there was time to touch a brace the sails had filled again and the roaring white sea had passed ahead
5656424 fell into the water very close alongside the vessel with a roar and caused the sea to make tremendous breakers which swept over the vessel
5656425 rushed across the sky like a rocket the next moment it passed over the topmast of the liner with a tremendous roar and plowed up the sea about fifty yards from the boat the upheaval of the water was terrific but the ship was not damaged
5656426 unless one is willing to postulate freezing temperatures across the equator such an explanation clearly begs the question
5656427 sudden death is indicated by the robust condition of the animals and their full stomachs the animals were robust and healthy when they died
5656428 the pleistocene period ended in death this was no ordinary extinction of a vague geological period which fizzled to an uncertain end this death was catastrophic and all inclusive
5656429 until recently the astronomical mainstream was highly critical of clube and napiers giant comet hypothesis however the crash of comet shoemaker levy 9 on jupiter in 1994 has led to a change in attitudes the comet watched by the worlds observatories was seen split into 20 pieces and slammed into different parts of the planet over a period of several days a similar impact on earth it hardly needs saying would have been devastating
5656430 the forest beneath the blast would have ignited suddenly burning until the impacts blast wave shut down the conflagration
5656431 dust may have been blown into the stratosphere where it would have been transported around the globe easily the region must have been devastated for decades
5656432 portentous and protracted eclipses of the sun occur such as the one after the murder of caesar the dictator
5656433 dry fogs crop failures famines in china and the mediterranean and plagues
5656434 however he could not long remain on account of the pestilence which nearly destroyed the whole nation it was called the yellow pestilence because it occasioned all persons who were seized by it to be yellow and without blood and it appeared to men a column of a watery cloud having one end trailing along the ground and the other above proceeding in the air and passing through the whole country like a shower going through the bottom of valleys whatever living creatures it touched with its pestiferous blast either immediately died or sickened for death and so greatly did the aforesaid destruction rage throughout the nation that it caused the country to be nearly deserted
5656435 but how on earth else would one determine what is ethnically scottish other than by the ethnic scots
5656436 as pointed out lowland scots is irrelevant with regard to ethnic scottishness genetics as previously pionted out is irrelevant being interested in genetics does not make one a racist but tying undue importance to it serves no purpose other than either phony ethnicism or that of a racist cause
5656437 you obviously do need to be told how to be taken seriously if you are putting forward unproven theories which few would take seriously to support your own arguments
5656438 religion is utterly irrelevant here though it might be different if the american presbyterian population maintained worship with gaelic psalms and other truly scottish features
5656439 millions of people in the uk have names of a norman origin does that make them norman of course it doesnt have a surname which is macanything doesnt make you scottish and only a fantasist would claim otherwise it doesnt matter how closely one can trace their roots to scotland unless one is in posession of scottish language and culture which is clearly not the case with the vast majority of those claiming scottish ethnicity or descent
5656440 you speak the language and are in possession of its culture
5656441 agreed that behavioural traits do tend to outlast langauge but they are comparatively insignificant and do not long outlast the loss of language and of culture social behavioural characteristics are defined by the society and culture into which one is born and raised and there is no surviving scottish society in the usa
5656442 to discuss something as unverifiable as this is utterly meaningless while qualifying ethnicity on the basis of something tangible like language is the only meaningful way of classing ethnicity
5656443 you also cant say that the scots were native and the anglo saxons werent
5656444 according to you i supppose the only true ethnic scots are the irish since you apparently refute the cultural influences of the lowland anglo saxon scots and the blending of the cultures of scotland
5656445 in terms of ancestry you have some very controversial opinions and are largely your own pov
5656446 these claims are ridculous and not backed up by anything other than your ethnocentric opinions huh kinda reminds me of how you described my pov
5656447 anyways who are you to decide what is irrelevant and what isnt
5656448 are you the divine creator of scotland and the world
5656449 genetics can be of great value to studying ethnic groups as it again reveals origins possible shared history with other groups as well as the impact of invasions settlements of other peoples on an ethnic group
5656450 you are also claiming that the egyptians are merely arabs and dont have a unique ethnic identity this is ridculous and the influence of the ancient egyptians cant just be limited to physical genetic chacteristics because egyptians do have a quite distinct identity within the larger arab world
5656451 those norman names go back 1 000 years and the normans were few in number when they conquered britain and just as with the normans in sicily were absorbed by the british population
5656452 i mean under your current classification all 200 million or so americans and however million more people out there from australia canada wherever are all ethnic english because their native tongue and in most cases only language as well many cultural traits is english or anglo saxon based

5656463 some commissioners have argued that the relative value units of the physician fee schedule should be at least partly based on a services value to medicare for example if analysis of clinical effectiveness for a given condition were to show that one service were superior to an alternative service for a given condition then medicares process of setting relative values might reflect that this process would be a departure from the established method of setting relative values based only on the time mental effort technical skill and effort psychological stress and risk of performing the service

5656504 but the target could be achieved sooner if our competitors lost market share faster
5656505 the advantage to a company of classifying somebody as exempt is that the company can make the employee work as much as it wants and the employees only remedy is to ask for more money quit or sue for back wages
5656506 it hinges on whether the employee exercises independent judgment and discretion with respect to matters of significance for the company
5656507 if you dont exercise independent judgment if you perform rote repetitive tasks in accordance with guidelines protocols checklists or established procedures youre not likely to be exempt under the administrative exemption because youre not exercising discretion youre just following the rules
5656508 companies like to give fancy titles to employees because its a costless way for them to make their employees feel valued and it has a corollary benefit of making employees sound like they fit an exemption if the employer has an eye to getting sued
5656509 weve found in these cases that there are established protocols and pathways and instructions and guidelines and ways of doing things that they have to follow time and time again

5656553 quando eravamo prigionieri a hanoi capitava di trovare a volte un pezzo di carota nella brodaglia del pasto e qualche mio compagno gridava ci rimandano a casa e finita la guerra ma non era cos i viet ci hanno tenuto in catene per anni allhotel hanoi allora giurai non mi lascer andare allentusiasmo finch non rivedr un soldato americano in uniforme
5656554 una civilt vinta o persa da coloro che si battono per proteggerla e giudichiamo se ne valga la pena in base alla gratitudine offerta ai propri soldati da coloro che sono stati salvati
5656555 paragonato allappariscente barack obama e al manerioso john edwards john mccain sembra vecchio e stanco
5656556 mccain sopravvissuto a un melanoma maligno e spesso il suo volto sembra gonfio le sue braccia sono immobilizzate da anni di torture come prigioniero di guerra nelle mani dei comunisti nordvietnamiti
5656557 john mccain a giudicare da tutte le critiche che provengono dalla base conservatrice trascender gran parte della politica tradizionale e attirer sostegno dallarena politica in ogni direzione proprio in virt del suo record di guerra se dovesse essere nominato e vincere a 72 anni non avrebbe ragione per triangolare o ipotecare il proprio futuro politico sarebbe deciso controverso e preoccupato dalla storia invece che dal momentaneo vantaggio politico mccain figlio di una lunga e gloriosa tradizione di ufficiali della marina proprio a causa del suo profondo legame con lesercito si ricorder ci che le nostre armate hanno portato al mondo negli ultimi settantanni per abbattere personaggi come hitler mussolini tojo i thugs sovietici milosevic i taliban e saddam che ne dicano la caricatura di hollywood e le caffetterie europee
5656558 diventare americano e prestare servizio nei marine oggi ci sono combattenti in iraq e afghanistan soldati i cui genitori non sono ancora cittadini americani ma che hanno sognato che i loro figli potessero difendere quel sogno devono renderci orgogliosi di essere americani
5656559 sono cresciuto in una piccola citt del texas occidentale scuola pubblica college facolt di legge pensavo di dover dare qualcosa in cambio
5656560 se perdessimo la guerra chi vincerebbe al qaida raccontatelo ai 160 mila americani di stanza in iraq
5656561 i leader democratici sorridevano e festeggiavano mentre gli ultimi voti venivano conteggiati che cosa celebravano la sconfitta la resa in iraq soltanto i nostri nemici stavano brindando
5656562 poco dopo mi hanno detto che si era svegliato e che voleva incontrarmi
5656563 mccain lunico ad avere lo sguardo giusto sul sacrificio di coloro che hanno portato sicurezza agli stati uniti e libert agli altri e che riposano nei cimiteri militari in tutto il mondo la tradizione americana militare di mccain lopposto del militarismo gli ufficiali sono sottoposti al governo consensuale non esiste un codice militare di giustizia che garantisce particolari diritti agli uomini in uniforme la stampa libera monitora lesercito non cos in corea del nord in cina in iran e a cuba la televisione e le global news hanno cambiato la percezione delle perdite in combattimento la cnn avrebbe mostrato diversamente iwo jima soltanto corpi distrutti nella spiaggia e niente alza bandiera sul monte suribachi gli americani sono diventati suburbani vogliamo vivere fino a 85 anni la cultura popolare ci chiede di sembrare quarantenni quando ne abbiamo sessanta con queste aspettative di perfezione ogni morte diventa una catastrofe nazionale come i disastri nelle battaglie di antietam e tarawa per ben pi poveri americani
5656564 la percezione pubblica negli anni di carter era che lamerica aveva perso una guerra per ragioni morali la necessaria risposta non fu imparare come era iniziata gestita e persa era meglio ignorare tutto ci che avesse a che fare con quellodioso affare il governo lesercito il business e la religione secondo i nuovi roussoviani avevano cospirato per corrompere lindividuo naturalmente pacifico le opulente societ occidentali si sono dimostrate riluttanti a usare la forza per prevenire violenze future pi grandi la guerra una cosa cattiva ma non la pi cattiva diceva john stuart mill lo stato morale decadente e degradato secondo cui niente vale una guerra per peggio abbiamo bisogno di maggiore umilt e conoscenza del passato gli americani devono ricordare che c qualcosa di peggio della guerra stalin hitler e mao hanno ucciso pi lontano dai campi di battaglia di quanti ne siano morti nelle guerre mondiali cambogia bosnia e ruanda sono state possibili perch non cerano truppe vicino ai massacratori come possibile che il paese che scampato a pearl harbour monte cassino anzio iwo jima okinawa hue e tet sia arrivato alla conclusione che liraq come ci ricordano i democratici il peggiore disastro dellintera storia americana
5656565 gli americani amano i vincitori e non tollerano i perdenti
5656566 il pubblico americano diventato contrario alliraq non a causa di cindy sheehan e michael moore ma perch ha sentito che le notizie dal campo di battaglia erano tutte pessime
5656567 la guerra riflette la cultura lesercito americano profondamente integrato con la societ americana la cultura popolare mostra entusiasmo per tutto ci che militare ma un eroe non contemplabile in questa cultura pacifista di ambiguit morale gli eroi nei nostri film di guerra sono persone ordinarie che odiano ci che fanno e che sono costrette a farlo nella nostra societ posteroica e postmoderna ci sono pochissime espressioni per la muscolarit e il sacrificio
5656568 la storia militare ha lo scopo morale di educarci ai sacrifici del passato che hanno garantito la nostra libert e sicurezza se non sapremmo niente di shiloh belleau wood tarawa e chosun le croci nei nostri cimiteri militari sarebbero soltanto pietre bianche gli stati uniti sono nati attraverso una guerra si sono riuniti in guerra e sono stati salvati dalla distruzione da una guerra lo studio della guerra ci ricorda che siamo soltanto uomini
5656569 il culto delle armi che trascende i campi di battaglia e diventa una ideologia che celebra il potere la disciplina e la fanatica devozione a una causa era cos per sparta la guardia pretoriana o le ss di hitler i colpi di stato militari anticostituzionali hanno portato cesare a oltrepassare il rubicone napoleone a mettere fine al direttorio hitler a distruggere la repubblica di weimar i caudillo dellamerica latina i colonnelli greci e i baathisti del medio oriente
5656570 pu essere chiamata liberalismo militare e ha facilitato la nascita di governi liberi dopo la seconda guerra mondiale lamerica ha mandato le truppe in afghanistan in bosnia in cambogia a cuba nella repubblica dominicana a grenada e haiti in iran e iraq in korea e kosovo in kuwait e libano in libia a panama in serbia e somalia e vietnam per combattere oligarchi dittatori e autocrati dimentichiamo spesso che i mali del xix e xx secolo la schiavit il nazismo il fascismo il militarismo giapponese e lo stalinismo sovietico non sono stati eliminati dalla forza e dalla minaccia della forza ma dalla prospettiva di governi democraticamente militari gli eserciti americani hanno posto fine alle piantagioni schiaviste ai campi di sterminio e al gulag e hanno reso possibile una nuova atlanta una nuova tokyo e una nuova berlino anche lesercito turco il guardiano dei valori liberali in quel paese lunica istituzione che resiste alla sharia e allislamizzazione della cultura turca
5656571 gli americani hanno abbattuto il peggior dittatore del mondo e piantato i rudimenti della societ liberale nel cuore del califfato offrendo unalternativa allautocrazia e alla teocrazia non ho visto americani confusi con la loro tecnologia in una cultura antica e tribale e una caricatura ci che mi ha colpito il contrasto fra gli americani dei suburb e lorrore delle condizioni in cui combattono e la fiducia che hanno investito nelle forze della libert e del pluralismo c la possibilit che qualcosa di migliore prenda vita dove terroristi e teocrati un tempo massacravano
5656572 ci sono 10 400 soldati americani che riposano nel cimitero della seconda guerra mondiale a st avold nella lorena nessun presidente americano ha mai visitato le loro tombe qualcuno dovrebbe farlo le necropoli di migliaia di giovani in uniforme con le stelle di david lasciano il visitatore muto le iscrizioni chiedono di ricordare il sacrificio il coraggio e la libert le voci dei nostri morti ci mormorano
5656573 dont plan to evacuate because youre sitting in a concrete bunker
5656574 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5656575 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5656576 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5656577 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5656578 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5656579 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5656580 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5656581 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5656582 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5656583 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5656584 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5656585 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5656586 this happens every year no matter how often we remind parents not to wait until the last minute
5656587 we did hear from a number of parents who didnt realize that under the state law children can be required to walk up to a mile and a half from their homes to catch the bus
5656588 also the district is only required to pick up students who live more than two miles from school
5656589 this is exactly the same as it was when i was here from the first grade through the fifth grade
5656590 even the piano is in the same spot and the colors are still the same it seems like nothing has changed
5656591 receiving this award serves as further reinforcement that we are on the right path as we strive to improve patient care outcomes
5656592 this study identifies superior leadership based on the success of hospital executive teams long term strategies for strengthening performance
5656593 he was getting his schedule worked out and all those things you have to do before the school year starts
5656594 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5656595 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5656596 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5656597 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5656598 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5656599 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5656600 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5656601 if you have read this article you will have seen that the xfx gtx 280 xxx generally comes out on top obviously the 280 cores are superior to the 4870s however i still feel the skulltrail board has some minor issues with the ati cards something we noticed at launch with the last radeon series
5656602 they all live in a house together and are given tasks where do you recognise that i dont think its challenging any more
5656603 i want to see him physically and deal with him i will deal with him personally before proceeding to court
5656604 this negative trend of child deaths has not recorded any significant changes in the national infant child and under five mortality rates since the early 1990s
5656605 miscarriages and low birth weight among pregnant women have been attributed to malaria but the fatality rate among children under five had declined from 3 7 percent to 2 4 percent between 2002 to 2005
5656606 it gained 9 035 045 5 percentage points from the may rate of 2 233 713 4
5656607 our inflation figures are way above that but what it tells us is that the productive base of the economy has really shrunk
5656608 we really need to change the way we do business
5656609 zimbabweans must realise that the country is in a practically binding state of socio economic emergency
5656610 as such there is need for a universal moratorium on all incomes and prices for a minimum period of six months
5656611 as i speak with you now valco is attracting international offers of over 200 million
5656612 we bought it valco two years ago at 20 million now we are selling only part of it for 200 and in addition will be earning interest that we never had in the past
5656613 what does the title of the poem mean to you
5656614 there are people who make things happen those who watch things happen and those who ask what happened
5656615 based on the course of the hurricane things are actually looking better and better for alachua county
5656616 last time we saw a lot of people come in at the last minute i think weve learned our lesson since then
5656617 you cant help what mother nature does but you can be prepared
5656618 the storms in 2004 gave us a good opportunity to see where our weaknesses were and weve been able to systematically renew and replace equipment in certain areas of town since then
5656619 its an older part of town so a lot of the facilities were old as well
5656620 if theres a silver lining to the storms its that they pointed out weaknesses that we might not have noticed otherwise
5656621 we basically just made sure we could reach all our people canceled any leave people had scheduled made sure our vehicles are in operating condition with gas in the tank and all the basic things youd do at home
5656622 if the ground gets wet from a heavy rain and we get a strong wind it really increases the likelihood that trees will topple
5656623 the danger of cutting down perfectly healthy trees is that suddenly you lose the protection a healthy tree canopy can offer from the wind
5656624 my mother had a bad tree in her yard in 2004 and my husband tied it off with a 4 inch diameter rope to another tree
5656625 gotta complain at each step to get to the next step i did try to email you shane i dont think itll let me on this old pda im posting from atm for some reason but ill try again

5656650 the data provided by these our unfortunate sisters indicate that some of them are professionals but due to the lack of jobs they have resorted to prostitution to just put body and soul together
5656651 it will even interest you to know that one of them is a professional journalist who could not find a job and had to enter the old age profession
5656652 those who would like to go back to school would be supported as well as those who want to learn any trade of their choice

5656655 they see our methods as legitimate our language as civil and refined that we represent peace fairness and transparency we address the issues especially the bread and butter issues that concern the people and we show respect to other candidates and other parties most importantly we keep our promise
5656656 lets not forget that our individual ambitions can only be achieved through the party
5656657 when we allow internal conflicts to sap our strength and destroy our unity we are ultimately destroying our party i urge each and every one of us to remember that the supreme interest of the party should dictate and guide all our actions
5656658 there are some who are threatening to vote skirt and blouse these people do not realise that they have fallen into the trap of our opponents no loyal and committed npp member should dream of let alone threaten to inflict such a invidious design on our party especially in this case where there is no justification
5656659 if you vote nana to the presidency and help elect a parliament of rival parties you are sentencing him nana akufo addo to inaction and spelling the doom of the party

5656729 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5656730 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5656731 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5656732 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5656733 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5656734 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5656735 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5656736 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress

5656764 the towpath which was where mules pulled canal boats looked like a jungle it was dense with all kinds of weeds and trees growing in there
5656765 i said to myself we ought to do something to try to save this
5656766 it was an engineering marvel but it also represented a very practical and measured need conveying goods to market
5656767 it meant a great deal to places like paterson because it afforded them the opportunity of shipping their goods down to newark
5656768 people dont think about whats happened over the years and they dont care its unfortunate
5656769 we hope younger people come along who will try to save whats left of history but its very difficult to get people to volunteer
5656770 it played an important role in the growth of little falls and surrounding towns
5656771 the unfortunate part is there were nice plaques along the walkway that described the canal that were vandalized it needs some protection right now its quite a different world today
5656772 it was just nibbled away in chunks it fell into desuetude
5656773 the canal society had done a wonderful job in trying to celebrate the technological history of the canal and bring it to peoples attention by marking it

5656782 our goal is to keep animals out of the shelters
5656783 the people at the rescue groups spend so much time working with the animals they dont have the energy to think about how to keep them from coming into the system
5656784 we kept thinking perhaps theres something we can do to find out why people give up their pets and to help keep them in their original homes
5656785 these animals were part of the family and they felt terrible about it but they couldnt afford to buy pet food
5656786 we had clients in financial difficulty who would ask us if we had food for their dogs and cats
5656787 we found a supplier who would take all coupons including their competitors
5656788 i bought 400 worth of food the last time we went and paid 67
5656789 every month we give out somewhere between 100 and 150 bags
5656790 you see such joy on peoples faces when they hear youre going to feed their pets
5656791 well be interviewing clients who need rental assistance or help with their utility bills and when we start talking about their pets the attitudes immediately change all the barriers fall
5656792 im not ruling it out but right now were so swamped with our primary focus of feeding families we havent been able to put it in place anywhere else
5656793 but cfa isnt the only place we could do it
5656794 were thinking about meals on wheels programs and other senior services programs for example
5656795 we highlight the animals on our web site companionanimaladvocates org and they go directly from their original home into a new home not into a rescue foster home or a shelter
5656796 any new jersey family that qualifies for a low income assistance program is eligible to get their pets spayed or neutered for a 10 co pay
5656797 there are elderly pet owners or owners who become ill and need help walking their dogs or who cant get a 50 pound bag of pet food up to their apartments
5656798 there are all sorts of possible programs that we havent yet begun to explore but that were trying to identify
5656799 our goal is to keep animals out of the shelters

5656818 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves
5656819 leveraging this talent pool makes us the best company in the world and keeping us there is what were interested in most
5656820 it makes us feel good but at the end of the day it makes us a great company and thats why were so interested in continuing to do it
5656821 the economy is not as bad as people think it is or it has been reported upon as it pertains to employment
5656822 in this time period where we do have combat operations ongoing in iraq and afghanistan it is a source of pride for a lot of our u s employees that ge is actively sourcing veterans
5656823 that makes people feel good about the company they work for
5656824 if i had a choice between equal people and one has a military background i would take the one that has the military background
5656825 just think of the experience theyve had and the maturity they bring in most cases
5656826 they have leadership skills they understand discipline and execution all the things that it takes to be successful they have had a short course in and had to do it its not like its academic
5656827 the reason employers seek out veterans and they do is because of the discipline that veterans usually can bring to the workplace
5656828 the typical service member is really good at making sound decisions with incomplete information and limited time
5656829 which just aligns itself nicely with the type of situations we find ourselves in the business world
5656830 everyone wants to be a contributor to society and have a self worth and employment adds to that
5656831 it took a little while to get the plans out and just how we were going to do this
5656832 a year ago we didnt even have the equipment to move to the units
5656833 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5656834 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5656835 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5656836 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5656837 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern
5656838 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5656839 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5656840 even the u s military which has a greater number of smart weapons sometimes accidentally hits civilians
5656841 they sent the tu 22 crew to their deaths thinking that the georgian air defense would mount no resistance
5656842 using the tu 22 for a reconnaissance mission over georgia was the same as using a microscope to drive nails
5656843 the victorious russia has found itself in complete isolation that raises the question of whether it was a victory
5656844 georgias military losses were higher than russias but financial political and moral losses of russia were much higher than those of georgia
5656845 beginning to walk but by no means were they running
5656846 if that was a u s brigade it would not have gone into combat
5656847 from what ive heard a lot of the 4th brigade was hit pretty hard
5656848 some of the soldiers seemed really grateful for the things we taught them
5656849 come from the hills of georgia and some of them sign for their paycheck with an x
5656850 overall goal is to bring georgia up to nato standards
5656851 i know specifically that bravo company im sure and i hope from what i did for them that theyre better off than they would have been if this happened four weeks ago
5656852 it was not an absolutely decisive factor whether georgians were trained by americans or not
5656853 what happened was due to the political decision of georgian authorities and not the performance on the ground
5656854 im not saying that were suffering here with the one million thread count sheets or checking out the local females at the pool
5656855 but if our job now is to sit here and put down roots in the couch id rather do it at home
5656856 reliance power and reliance comm will continue to drift away there is no any major downside on rcom but i do not see much more than a sideways price action in the forthcoming few weeks so from a short term perspective stay away from both of those counters
5656857 grs is not an option for transsexual christians seeking therapy because it transgresses the divine creational ideal for human sexuality and sexual relationships the bible appears to favour the view that human sexual identity is determined biologically the christian community should never agree that transsexual operations be allowable for christians but it should at the same time be willing to support the christian transsexual who is willing to work patiently through the issue
5656858 reliance petroleum is the only stock that the investor would probably try to latch on to as everyday goes by or near the start date to the refinery and lot of investors have made decent profits in it over the last couple of years since results reliance communications has sold off and is underperforming the markets with no real positive trigger to take it back higher
5656859 reliance industries will obviously be the main one that any bullish investor would be looking forward to lead the markets higher and it is always a sentiment booster it is ultimately one of the bellwether stocks and one of the heavy weights and results were disappointing so from a fundamental perspective any correction in it i think would be used as an opportunity for longer term investors and not probably for speculators

5656869 it is possible that the recent oil price increases have set off such a process and that if oil prices remain on an upward trajectory the adaption process may still have a long way to run

5656888 with the film paupahan i have no regrets kasi maganda ang cast a lot of people appreciated it naman and i can say its a quality film i guess ang mali ko lang talaga is that i failed to inform my dad about the totality of the character
5656889 medyo sexy pero i didnt show any flesh yung language lang as in bold siya nagmumura siya palagi i actually informed him her father matt about the film pero siya kasi as an actor ayaw niyang makialam dun sa script ayaw niyang basahin dahil its my project
5656890 hindi ko pa rin matanggap na ill do talaga all out mature roles so its good na medyo nagho host ako tapos meron din akong wholesome roles
5656891 were okay na hes more understanding now and im more open to him about my decisions
5656892 i feel very sad not just for baron but for his family and his very close friends as well right now im very close with his mom who trusts me very much and i appreciate that trust its really sad because people can be very judgmental
5656893 what they see on tv thats what they think is the truth its disappointing to know that people just judge based on whats shown on tv and not really make an effort to know not just what the truth is but to know more about it
5656894 hes taking it pretty well i have to say his family supports him fully most especially his mom his mom is one great mom shes a strong woman shes very positive and good natured
5656895 im happy to be by his side during all these controversies because he says that im a good influence in his life right now he says na when hes with me he doesnt drink or think of doing things like that
5656896 he doesnt drink as much anymore he still drinks but thats okay because i also think that when you try to get over a vice you have to do it gradually and i believe that hes doing a good job
5656897 kasi for me above everything else were friends and when a friend does something youre not supposed to judge him youre supposed to just be there and give him advice you dont cease to become someones friend just because he may or may not have done something wrong
5656898 for me he told me early on in one of our talks na im not like any other woman and i am special to him kaya when i heard what about what happened that night i wasnt affected i really didnt believe it
5656899 if i were the government i will charge them under the anti terrorism law they fall squarely under the human security act you have to charge them the fact is they committed a crime
5656900 based on my experience this is just the beginning this will escalate dont ever think that those guys those other people in mindanao will take this lightly in the end the government will have to fight both sides
5656901 if you are being fired upon what do you do you pray i wasnt taught like that i had been 17 years in that job and i wasnt taught that way that when you are fired upon you pray the bullet will not say to whom it may concern

5656954 facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan

5656956 isi is a patriotic institution which is working for the stability of the country
5656957 unser fokus liegt darauf im laufenden gesch ftsjahr insgesamt profitabel zu werden
5656958 the area is extremely dangerous and can go from smiles and a wave to extreme violence in less than a minute so all the soldiers are switched on and prepared to react to any situation
5656959 this is the wild west and the further you go out from musa qala it is the rule of the gun that counts the taliban are here and are making themselves known with attacks onto afghan and british forces
5656960 the area is however making slow but steady progress with a new school new health centre a new mosque new roads and a busy bazaar twice a week there is also cash for workers scheme which the local community engage in for employment
5656961 the local people get on with their life even though danger is all around them it is incredible to witness
5656962 at present they are happy with the afghan and british forces providing security and bringing a sense of normality to the area
5656963 the children here are like any other children throughout the world they are curious of the soldiers and like sweets and play games with each other they normally ask the jocks for their pens in pashto that they keep in their body armour as they love drawing and writing
5656964 going on patrol into the green zone is as beautiful as it is dangerous
5656965 branching of from the river are irrigation ditches that provide rat runs for the taliban and good cover from small arms fire as well as water to feed the crops
5656966 they are well versed in conflict and before something happens women and children can be seen moving away from where the taliban and ourselves converge
5656967 they stay in compounds which are made of baked mud and are incredibly tough are about 10 foot high and two foot thick contained within the compound will be a few mud baked buildings some livestock possibly a tree and some flowers
5656968 the jocks enjoy patrolling in the green zone it is a tough environment and your soldiering skills have to be sharp
5656969 we gauge the atmospherics as we go through populated areas sometimes people will smile sometimes they dont and either way my guys will say salaam alaaykum peace be with you it is a good way of breaking the ice
5656970 as well as deploying with our weapons ammunition radios and body armour we need about 10 litres of water so we can operate effectively it all adds to more weight that you have to carry
5656971 our enemy does not have that constraint as he cuts about in a dish dash pair of trainers an rpg rocket propelled grenade and drinks the local water source so he can move at speed
5656972 over the few months in this area alone we have had a suicide bomber and a number of ied attacks against us resulting in eight ana soldiers killed and one british soldier killed
5656973 this is a dangerous job and all the jocks are committed to each other and regardless what happens they always want to get back on patrol no one wants to be the guy that lets the other guy down
5656974 the jocks have to measure between keeping themselves alive and ensuring that the locals can speak to them if they have any issues or information to give any vehicle or motorcycle that approaches a patrol is dealt with robustly and the jocks go through a well oiled drill to ensure it is not a suicide bomber
5656975 la nica manera de que el sistema tenga disciplina es permitir que algunas compa as quiebren simplemente no se puede tener una industria que o bien tenga grandes beneficios o bien sea rescatada

5656982 the best part of the match for us was the beginning of the second set but to win we had to be perfect
5656983 we will be cheering for them in the finals i hope they will because they are the best
5656984 its not easy to come straight in and play a game against arsenal i thought abdoulaye and leon were superb people cant expect all of us to click with each other straight away but it was an encouraging start
5656985 from what ive seen leon is a great defender he reminds me a lot of curtis davies theyre similar in the way they play i thought he was outstanding on saturday
5656986 i found out on thursday when the gaffer set up the team shape the gaffer had a word with deano but he never really said a lot to me
5656987 he said this is the team im going to start with on saturday i was delighted i came here to establish myself and the first thing i needed to do was get the gaffer to pick me
5656988 i said when i came here its wasnt going to be easy to get in front of deano because hes a great keeper fortunately i got the nod
5656989 i never had a great deal to do at arsenal the defence did really well they held the line well made arsenal try and come through us and they never had too many clear cut chances

5656992 our goal in pursuing a combination of cadence and mentor graphics was to create a company that would offer customers a broader and more fully integrated product and technology portfolio in a timeframe that would better enable them to address urgent and complex challenges associated with their next generation product development it is unfortunate for mentor graphics shareholders however that despite our best efforts mentor graphics board and management were unwilling to engage in substantive discussions on what we believe would have been a compelling opportunity to create significant value for both companies shareholders and customers
5656993 cadence is a disciplined buyer and will only pursue transactions that make sound financial sense for our shareholders mentor graphics failure to engage in substantive discussions on our all cash premium proposal prevented us from confirming for our financing sources the significant synergies associated with this transaction that along with our revised outlook and the present economic climate led us to conclude that financing terms for the transaction are no longer attractive for our shareholders we remain focused on executing our strategy of delivering holistic solutions that address our customers key challenges while ensuring that cadence operates in the most cost efficient manner
5656994 mentor graphics acknowledged cadence design systems press release indicating that cadence was withdrawing their proposal to acquire mentor graphics mentor graphics notes that this withdrawal is inconsistent with both cadences recent public statements and recent communications between mentor graphics and cadence mentor graphics was aware that as described in the cadence press release cadence was facing challenges in obtaining financing for the transaction additionally today the federal trade commission ftc made a second request indicating that regulatory review of the previously proposed transaction would have been protracted

5657072 career days are to provide our students with steps they can take after graduation whether that be brown university bridgewater state college new england tractor trailer school or the army or navy
5657073 this group wants to have a debate thats not what these career days are for
5657074 if we open it up to them others seeing it as a forum for discussion will want to set up tables too
5657075 but most of the horror stories they told were from far off in other parts of the country not in bridgewater

5657081 if the state allows the mining to proceed after the whole nation knows what mtr will do to the wind potential then theyre going to look really bad
5657082 and mtr is going to be viewed in a whole new light as destroying the resources that renewable energy and alternative economic development could be based on
5657083 in a very old very destructive and very dirty way
5657084 if the nations going to be really serious about moving toward clean energy
5657085 it could really show its commitment to that by preserving coal river mountain through wind power
5657086 if you can build a wind farm in the middle of the appalachian coalfields on a mountain slated for mountaintop removal it would be a powerful statement toward making people part of the alternative energy economy

5657108 we need more rational discussion about nuclear power in australia and much less of the emotive political debate weve had in the last few years
5657109 we cannot envisage any circumstance under which australia will have a nuclear power industry he said then
5657110 the last election showed that australians are absolutely of one mind about not having 25 nuclear power plants dotted around their suburbs and in and around their cities mr garrett said
5657111 are they really saying that they have a plan for 25 nuclear reactors in australia where are they going to put them senator wong said
5657112 australia has an abundance of renewable energy sources we have a lot of solar we have a lot of wind we have geothermal resources she said

5657184 while we are still monitoring the situation and it is probably a little early we have not seen any significant russian movement out of georgia today
5657185 over the last few days russia has fired over two dozen ss 21 ballistic short range missiles into the country of georgia integrating ballistic missile strikes with their conventional military forces
5657186 the use of ballistic missiles by russia in this conflict sends an endorsement to the international community that the use of ballistic missiles has value thus propelling countries and terrorist organizations to develop purchase and continue to proliferate ballistic missiles
5657187 we are seeing evidence of ss 21 missiles in south ossetia

5657195 our coaches who work hard on what were trying to prepare i think would rather not have their thoughts and ideas and game plans out there kicked around until they get to showcase them
5657196 getting to sit down so close to the field you see how big and strong and fast and the types of athletes we have out here

5657215 she broke down while she was on air and told some of the other housemates she had some bad news and had to go home
5657216 when i spoke to her she was very upset frightened and i tried to reassure her as best i could

5657237 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5657238 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority

5657265 singing for the pope in new york yankees stadium was really cool but also scary and funny liam eating some food that wasnt reserved for the pope it was funny because when we were waiting to go on this trolley of food came by and on top was a plastic bag with a piece of paper saying pope food on it photos and there were loads of priests we had to squeeze past and they were all joking and taking photos on their mobiles but it was scary to walk out in front of 60 000 people knowing we were on tv standing in the middle of the stadium and seeing the crowd in broad daylight normally you cant see the audience in a theatre because of the lights clapping and i could hear them with that many people cheering and clapping its loud but once we were in place i couldnt see because the baseball floodlights were so bright so all i could do was sing and then there was no time to be scared afterwards we had to bash through the crowds and get to the airport still wearing our white robes because we had to catch a long flight home for school the next day

5657269 i started watching wrestling at the beginning of this year my brother was looking through the tv channels and we found it we got really into it and started watching it all the time my dad started watching too when he wasnt working my favourite wrestler is jeff hardy i think he is really good he is really entertaining and he has some good moves i dont like randy orton he is the champion and he says that no one can beat him but people have beaten him before but he ignores those matches the o2 arena we had to get the bus then a train and then a tube the o2 was really big and there were already loads of people by the time we got there we got to eat in one of the restaurants while we waited the restaurant was really nice and also packed everything went dark when we got in the arena all the seats were filled after a few other matches raw started everything went dark and fireworks started exploding there were loads of them and they were very loud we saw mickie james beat beth phoenix for the womans championship and a match between triple h and jbl randy orton ran down and helped beat up triple h everyone started chanting we want cena and i was wearing my cena t shirt but he didnt come down late night it was so cool that it didnt end until 11pm and then we went back to our hotel i was really really excited because i had never been to the o2 arena before or seen wrestling it was my first time and it was the best thing i have ever been to
5657270 i was lucky enough to go to a talk given by jeremy strong he writes funny books for children he has published 77 so far my favourites are i am telling you theyre aliens my sisters got a spoon up her nose and my mums going to explode fast dogs jeremy strong told us how he got the idea for the books about the 100 miles an hour dog one of the teachers at the primary school where he used to work asked him to walk her dogs molly and mabel as soon as he let them off the leads they ran speedily in opposite directions it took him two hours to get them both back but he was happy that he had made up a new character nickname after the talk i got to meet him and ask some questions he told me two of his favourite characters are krazy kow and the sparky 14 year old girl called fizz from the book for teenagers called stuff i also found out that his nickname is jay which is my brothers name too he has given me inspiration to become a famous author

5657272 green sunday is a campaign we started to try and reduce our carbon footprints we reckon every sunday should be a family day during which people dont use their cars and reduce the amount of electricity they use dont use electrical appliances unless its absolutely necessary this includes the tv and computer if you have to use electricity keep it to a minimum and switch it off not to standby when youre done cut back a way to try and get greener is to try and cut back your energy use think how it can be done and act on it green sunday is all about producing less pollution by not using your car for the day turning your television off and not having it on stand by and turning off unnecessary lights instead we try to spend the day talking and playing together as a family if you have to go out you could walk or cycle or use public transport for longer journeys you could do other stuff like gardening reading writing or painting if we continue to produce more and more pollution and use more electricity than we really need we are damaging our planet

5657286 als handelsprofi mit umfassender erfahrung im betrieb von filial ketten und mit seinen erfahrungen im bereich einkauf und fashion wird andr rinnensland entscheidend dazu beitragen unsere hervorragende wettbewerbsposition zu behaupten und weiter auszubauen
5657287 der abschluss dieser phase ist ein wichtiger schritt im rahmen unserer betriebst tigkeit in bulgarien auch wenn wir wegen der hohe dr cke keine langzeituntersuchung durchf hren konnten verhielt sich die gasquelle wie wir es auf grundlage unseres modells der lagerst tte vorhergesagt hatten dies untermauert die richtigkeit unserer technischen beurteilung des gasfundes
5657288 von allen erdgaslagerst tten die je in bulgarien gefunden wurden weist diese den h chsten druck auf

5657290 grundidee des projekts ist es migranten selbst aktiv in integrationsprozesse mit einzubeziehen auf diese weise wird das engagement nachhaltig verankert
5657291 die starke nachfrage an muttersprachlichen gesundheitsinformationen sahen die betriebskrankenkassen als einen klaren handlungsauftrag der bislang so gro e erfolg des pr ventionsprojektes freut uns ganz besonders
5657292 im zentrum der veranstaltungen steht nat rlich die aufkl rung ber das gesundheitssystem die gruppen melden aber auch besonderen informationsbedarf an und stellen sehr pers nliche gesundheitsfragen
5657293 es ist zum beispiel sehr wichtig zu wissen ob man den krankenwagen selbst bezahlen muss und wie man ihn ruft
5657294 wer die begrifflichkeiten kennt kann auch aktiver an der gesellschaft teilhaben
5657295 das ist genauso wichtig f r rzte und therapeuten wie f r deren patienten
5657296 this is a tough job for me i have to mug up the lengthy dialogue and express them too
5657297 no limits and in fact will probably result in even higher levels of immigration
5657298 it is so complex and bureaucratic with potentially 26 000 job titles that it is highly likely to lead to chaos and confusion increasing the scope for abuse
5657299 piece by piece the governments case for the highest levels of immigration in our history has been dismantled most recently by the house of lords economic committee yet once again the government have ducked the issue of limits to the numbers admitted
5657300 the numbers could well take off as employers emulate their competitors leaving the home office struggling yet again
5657301 including students we could see nearly half a million applicants a year on past form the home office will not have the staff to check the authenticity of applications if so it will be only a matter of time before they simply go through the motions for the sake of appearances as we have seen in the past this leads to chaos and eventually collapse as in the case of the asylum system three years ago
5657302 its main effect will be to open the skilled section of our labour force to cut price competition thus reducing the incentive for employers to train british staff
5657303 because of the complexity of the scheme and the likely scale of applications there is bound to be abuse and given the absence of embarkation controls and the legal and practical obstacles to removing people the numbers could well get out of hand
5657304 the government are now promising to listen they would do well to listen to the 75 of the public who wish to see a substantial reduction in immigration certainly not an open ended conveyor belt adding still further to the numbers we already have from eastern europe the bottom line is that a points based system without a limit is worse than pointless
5657305 more labour lies new points scheme will increase immigration invasion not decrease it
5657306 without consulting with the segment of the school it would impact the most
5657307 the caucasian students were not told to go eat lunch with the hispanic students or participate in their soccer games

5657310 unlike clinton he mccain really does have years of foreign policy experience and actually was under enemy fire his support of the surge has been largely validated by events in the wake of the russian invasion of georgia mccain seems ready indeed tailor made for the role of commander in chief if we are headed for a redux of the cold war
5657311 a broader base general electorate may be a harder sell for obama less starry eyed working class voters and those in mccains age bracket who turn out in huge number on election day may be the very skeptics to whom mccain can appeal
5657312 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5657313 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5657314 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5657315 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5657316 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5657317 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5657318 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5657319 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5657320 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5657321 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5657322 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5657323 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5657324 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5657325 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5657326 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5657327 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5657328 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5657329 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5657330 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5657331 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5657332 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5657333 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5657334 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5657335 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5657336 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
5657337 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
5657338 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5657339 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5657340 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5657341 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5657342 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5657343 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5657344 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5657345 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5657346 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5657347 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5657348 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5657349 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5657350 conservatism has been an intellectual home to people like burke and buckley the gop is the party that gave us lincoln and reagan it seems to me that its leaders ought to make it clear that they find what dr corsi is doing to be both wrong and repellent to have their movement and their party associated with such a figure would be a terrible thing and it will only help the cause of those who hold both the gop and the conservative movement in contempt
5657351 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5657352 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5657353 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5657354 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5657355 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5657356 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5657357 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente

5657360 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer

5657364 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra

5657369 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5657370 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5657371 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5657372 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5657373 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5657374 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5657375 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5657376 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5657377 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5657378 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5657379 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5657380 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5657381 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5657382 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5657383 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5657384 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5657385 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5657386 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5657387 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5657388 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5657389 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5657390 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5657391 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5657392 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5657393 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5657394 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5657395 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5657396 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5657397 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5657398 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5657399 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5657400 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5657401 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

5657467 while doing some research for the review this critic ran across an interesting recent article june 2008 about filmmaker andrev iskanov seems the russian federal security service or fsb visited the director in association with the information and images he offered in this film they were looking to confiscate any materials he had used in connection with its creation after a warrantless search and five days of detention which he signed off on post incident under duress he was released some of his work was returned clearly someone in authority believes that the subject matter inherent in philosophy of a knife will be damaging to their countrys international image while it may not work as a standard entertainment it does present a compelling and often difficult to watch experience therefore while it wont be for everyone the film still earns a highly recommended rating there is something primal almost unconsciously unnerving about what iskanov accomplishes here weve seen these kind of ersatz exploitation beats before but this time they seem to have the aesthetic power to stick this is a movie that will haunt you for days afterward
5657468 highly recommended even if youve been suspicious of guy maddins bizarre point of view before toss out any worry when it comes to brand upon the brain criterion collection its a delicious malformation of an autobiography playing with movie iconography and childhood nostalgia in order to examine the seminal experiences that indelibly changed the auteurs psyche shot like a silent movie with multiple versions of the score and narrators to choose from this crazy hybrid of melodrama sci fi and horror excites more than it confounds but even the confounding is exciting in maddins delirious world complete with new short films and a decoder ring documentary mark another in the win category for criterion
5657469 if you dont already have the encore release or dont want to shell out big bucks for that expensive limited edition import this is the way to go despite the interlaced transfer and the absence of some key supplemental items redemptions release isnt perfect but it is readily available at a good price and it offers a respectful presentation of one of jean rollins finest films recommended
5657470 is a mess of lousy filmmaking and unrelenting artistic bankruptcy smashed together to form an ear splitting overcooked awfully irritating shell of an experience whatever bloody knuckle merriment marshall was intending with this tribute to the cinema speeds of the 80s has been lost in the headache inducing translation if you already own the movies mentioned in this review if you groove on kurt russell in his gnarly snake plissken persona and can only see sigourney weaver and milla jovovich as hard as nails female ass kickers then theres no reason to revisit their lesser duplicates in doomsday indeed working up anything other than a minor amount of morbid curiosity for this bomb belies the films many missteps a score of skip it would suffice if only because theres better marshall out there but some fans actually liked this uninteresting free for all so in order to be fair a rent it is required once again it provides a way for both sides of the situation the lovers and the haters to have their say from this critics perspective doomsday is a dud the idea of neil marshall taking on the end of the world always had a certain anticipatory flair unfortunately theres a million miles of disappointment between the prospect and its eventual realization
5657471 is at times totally off the rails and completely surreal and the ending strives for pathos it doesnt fully earn but these are minor quibbles when writer director neil marshall turns the volume all the way up to 11 lets his freak flag fly and doles out the gut churning violence like some kind of mad chef its probably one of the weirdest nastiest and most adrenaline pumping flicks youll see this year recommended
5657472 doomsday is a blood spattered love letter to that big stack of post apocalyptic flicks from the early 80s as trashy cacklingly depraved and ultraviolent as the best of em kinda goes without saying that this isnt exactly for everyone and im not gonna pretend that theres anything particularly original about it but doomsday knows exactly what sort of grindhouse sci fi action flick it wants to be and plows ahead unrelentingly guns blazing as for this blu ray disc its kinda light on extras but the 1080p video and lossless audio are both first rate highly recommended
5657473 is a cut above the average sci fi flick though not matching the headiness of kubricks 2001 a space odyssey or tarkovskys solaris or stalker dark city is a stylish middlebrow sci fi film as densely packed with cinematic references as any tarantino flick yet still capable of entertaining a broad audience with two cuts of the film five commentary tracks and lots of other extras this release has plenty of material to explore though film aficionados will be disappointed with how new line has overworked the image with ugly edge enhancement and unnecessary digital noise reduction that scrubs the image free of its original grain more casual viewers will only notice the significantly enhanced video and audio highly recommended
5657474 the mummy returns had several standout moments for me from the ancient catfight between the two female leads weisz and velasquez looking hot to fraser fighting the assorted mummies to the pygmy scene to the ending fight the reliance on special effects was a bit over the top and a mistake but i cant deny the appeal of the movie as a pop corn flick the multiple layers of the show allow for repeat views that have driven my own multiple dips into improved versions of the release over the years the technical enhancements not working as well this time as they seemed to push the cgi and matted backgrounds further than they were ready for without additional processing still you can hardly go wrong with the title on blu ray since it was a fast paced and fun flick well worth your time and money as a sequel that does a moderate attempt of living up to the previous version not falling flat like most of them do but hardly working as well either
5657475 there is a bit more to the movie than simply fine shapely t amp a however
5657476 it seems shocking to actually be suggesting it but decades after critics and filmmakers alike condemned colorization as a travesty and counterproductive to artistic intent we have a wonderful example of the glorified gimmick fully authenticating the purpose of a project and the man who made the movie in the first place
5657477 thomas spurlin also gave the disc a spin and his thoughts were along the same lines
5657478 takes the waning ghostly formula and injects it with an artful shot of adrenaline its still chained down a bit by the blueprint set by its predecessors but il hwak chos take on the idea does it with gusto that its worth asian horror film fans as well as fans of mind benders in general genius products disc is attractive visually but lacks in supplemental material and aural properties the disc is well worth a rental just for the film alone possibly more if youre a hardcore aficionado of the genre
5657479 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5657480 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at us 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
5657481 especially since there is a clear lack of buying momentum

5657491 it must respect prior rights and marks it mustnt be confusingly similar to any existing tld for example a kom would be too close to a com if it represents a community it must be with the full agreement of that community and it must respect morality and public order
5657492 icann intends to use auctions in the new gtld process as a tie breaking mechanism not the primary allocation mechanism for the resolution of string contention among competing new gtld applicants for identical or similar strings
5657493 auction would be the final means of settling any contention cases that have not been resolved at any of the previous stages in the process
5657494 on balance the economic arguments favour the use of auctions in some form where scarcity exists in relation to the goals set by icann for allocation procedures
5657495 they are particularly strong in relation to allocation decisions concerning to existing resources and where a tie breaker is needed during a comparative selection procedure for a new resource in all cases the best elements of comparative selection procedures could still be incorporated at a prequalification stage for registries using straightforward transparent and objective procedures that preserve the stability of the internet
5657496 auctions are well suited to accomplishing the goal of allocative efficiency putting scarce resources into the hands of those who value them the most
5657497 as such the results of auctions tend to create greater social value than alternative allocation mechanisms
5657498 various devices can be considered for favoring disadvantaged bidders in an auction
5657499 for example a 25 per cent bidding credit could be offered to community based bidders whose community is located primarily in least developed countries a 300 000 bid from such a bidder would be viewed as equivalent to a 400 000 bid from a wealthy country

5657523 one of gvs primary objectives is to enable our clients to securely connect to our company for delivery of real time data and processing online
5657524 this requires that we eliminate the need for manually generated vouchers leverage electronic vouchers to increase the speed and accuracy of claims processing and provide the capability for electronically validating members eligibility and pre authorization status but more importantly we must be in complete compliance with hipaa and hcfa healthcare regulations we view autonomy as a strategic component of this objective
5657525 were excited about the prospect of eliminating our paper files as we transition to electronic document management indexed electronic documents can be accessed by any of our employees at any time faster than trying to reconstruct a paper trail in addition autonomys enterprise records management solution will allow us to eliminate significant amounts of physical paper storage costs which will further help to streamline our operational expenses

5657543 i had the privilege of knowing john over the years and in all the roles he undertook in public service and in campaign after campaign he never grew apart from the industries he worked in and the people he represented

5657574 hockey is not just sport and its more than a passion it is an ingrained part of who we are how we live our lives and go about our business grown men play the game until they are too old and their bones too brittle to endure the rigours of skating
5657575 there is an artistry to the game both a ferocity and a beauty that make hockey appealing
5657576 hockey players walk among us they are like us they are not overly tall like basketball players they are not beefed up like football players or juiced up like baseball players they are essentially average size and weight what separates them from us is that they are in meticulous physical condition and have incredible speed and strength and they have an indefatigable will to win that the average person simply does not possess

5657605 its ridiculously fast going from publishers very cold were thinking about it point of view to a queue of people saying lets do something can you get it done by christmas
5657606 anybody and everybody who has money to spend on games development is looking at the iphone space there is no one except for sony nintendo microsoft obviously that hasnt asked us about it we were talking to apple in early spring and we had a similar view to everyone else we werent sure where it would go and thought it could go the way of mobile games but we had a four hour meeting with apple and our eyeballs were well and truly widened theirs too because they are still learning a lot about games
5657607 the iphone story is going to be huge the monkey ball numbers have made people site up and take notice
5657608 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5657609 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5657610 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5657611 we hear from caseworkers that a growing number of those seeking help for their families are displaced workers who have been downsized out of the workplace

5657617 ivory upright pianos is the perfect departure from the grand piano virtual instruments were known for
5657618 in some ways it was even more challenging to produce than ivory or italian grand because these four pianos had so much personality and nuance to capture but were thrilled with the results and we think our customers who for years have been asking us to make an upright piano instrument will be very satisfied
5657619 i do want to play in the nfl hopefully one day and i know i need numbers
5657620 im really behind rey and cush and i have to play catch up
5657621 weve got averell spicer and christian tupou at nose tackle and theyre doing fine but the important thing is for all of us for kyle moore and everson griffen and me to step it up and make up for what sedrick gave us

5657623 its a problem for everyone else that they cant figure out why we do it that way
5657624 hij zal het verschrikkelijk gaan missen om op het mooiste plekje van een vliegtuig te mogen reizen

5657627 ik heb zelf niet zo veel problemen met de oorlog
5657628 maar ik vind het vreselijk dat ik moet omrijden dat kost tijd
5657629 ik ben een in tbilisi gevestigde taxichauffeur en neem vooral vluchtelingen mee op lange afstanden ik accepteer de meeste valuta maar geen russische roebels
5657630 laat maar die nemen we niet mee die heeft geen geld
5657631 ik leefde in abchazi en moest vluchten naar rusland omdat mijn vrouw daar vandaan kwam nu probeer ik al jaren een georgisch paspoort te krijgen maar dat lukt niet hij had gehoopt dat er onder saakasjvili een andere politieke wind zou waaien maar de jongste oorlog doet hem daaraan twijfelen
5657632 saakasjvili is iemand die zijn leven lang achter de computer zat
5657633 hij kent de virtuele wereld maar het echte leven kent hij niet
5657634 ziet u de volle maan dat is het enige waar we trots op kunnen zijn
5657635 we hebben brood tomaten en vlees we staan hier de hele nacht
5657636 als kind deed ik er soms maanden over om een door de war gedraaide kubus goed te krijgen nu maak ik in mijn vrije tijd computerprogrammas die de puzzel gestructureerd oplossen
5657637 er zijn posities die twintig draaibewegingen nodig hebben dus de limiet kan daar nooit onder liggen
5657638 dat vereist veel rekenkracht mijn eigen computer zal er vijftig jaar over doen om alles door te rekenen toch verwacht ik dat het veel sneller gaat omdat ik de supercomputer van sony pictures imageworks mag gebruiken op momenten dat zij capaciteit over hebben
5657639 in theorie kun je alle 43 triljoen mogelijkheden langslopen maar zelfs voor een computer is dat onbegonnen werk daarom hak ik het probleem in stukken zodat het oplossen veel minder rekenkracht vereist ik gebruik enkele biljoenen kubusposities waarvan ik met mijn computerprogramma heb bewezen dat ze in twintig stappen of minder zijn op te lossen vervolgens wil ik aantonen dat elke willekeurige kubuspositie in een of twee stappen ten minste n van deze sleutelposities kan bereiken is dat het geval dan weet ik dat alle mogelijke kubusposities binnen 22 stappen zijn op te lossen
5657640 elk dier dat ik inventariseer probeer ik te begrijpen bij de gladde slang nam dat behoorlijk veel tijd in beslag
5657641 dit is knots het derde dier dat we hier vonden we volgen haar sinds 2004 en daar liggen 14 07 en 6 05
5657642 het is onze meest warmteminnende slang dat is ook de reden dat het dier pas in april uit zijn winterslaap komt de soort streeft naar een constante lichaamstemperatuur van 29 tot 33 graden celsius komt hartje zomer de zon vroeg op aan een wolkeloze lucht dan zal die optimale temperatuur snel zijn bereikt en houdt het reptiel zich daarna in de vegetatie schuil zodra de lichaamstemperatuur onder de 29 graden daalt begint hij weer te zonnen bij mindere weersomstandigheden zal de slang daar meer tijd voor uittrekken en dat maakt de trefkans groter zelfs bij bewolking of tijdens een licht regenbuitje blijft een gladde slang dikwijls nog op zijn zonplek liggen
5657643 dit proces vergt zo veel van ieder wijfje dat zij zich in nederland maar eens in de twee jaar laat bevruchten drachtige dieren verplaatsen zich hooguit enkele meters en gaan evenmin actief op jacht alle energie is nodig voor de ontwikkeling van de jongen in het moederlichaam
5657644 ik beoordeel dat op gewicht mannetjes wegen ongeveer 50 gram vrouwtjes begin juni het dubbele eind juli zijn ze misschien wel 200 gram als de jongen in augustus of begin september op een beschutte plek zijn afgezet zitten de dames weer op hun oude gewicht
5657645 de wijfjes zijn na het baren totaal uitgeput de huid slobbert om hun lichamen en ze hebben enkele dagen nodig om bij te komen het lijken net lekke fietsbanden
5657646 meestal eten ze nestmuizen komen in een leefgebied veel hagedissen voor dan staan die ook op het menu soms grijpen ze kikkers en kuikens van op de grond broedende vogels
5657647 je kunt beter vragen wie eet hem niet wild zwijn vos das egel steenmarter en buizerd peuzelen hem graag op
5657648 het dier vertrouwt enorm op zijn schutkleur wordt de situatie te bedreigend dan zal hij eerder vluchten dan bijten het is overigens verboden hem te vangen en te doden het reptiel geniet in heel europa strikte bescherming
5657649 grotere veldkennis heeft er wel toe bijgedragen dat deze soort eerder wordt opgemerkt en daardoor minder zeldzaam is dan we aanvankelijk dachten
5657650 het maaien en plaggen van heide blijft f achterwege waardoor de heide dichtgroeit f het beheerswerk gebeurt te grootschalig waardoor grote oppervlakten lange tijd ongeschikt zijn door de inzet van grote grazers verdwijnen eveneens schuilmogelijkheden ten opzichte van vrijlopende koeien en paarden biedt een schaapskudde die geleid wordt door een herder veel meer voordelen de kudde kan immers gestuurd worden naar plekken waar de begrazing het hardst nodig is en bijzondere kwetsbare delen kunnen juist worden ontzien
5657651 kleinschaliger veel gevarieerder en gericht op kwetsbare soorten daar zijn geen lange onderzoeken voor nodig er is genoeg expertise in nederland om te zeggen welke planten en dieren daarvan profiteren de ideale biotoop voor de gladde slang een open reli frijk terrein met veel variatie in nat en droog hoog en laag zon en schaduw en dichte en open begroeiing
5657652 daarvan zijn er nu zeven bewoond dergelijke bulten vol holen en gaten zetten echt zoden aan de dijk als in een natuurgebied een gezonde populatie gladde slangen voorkomt betekent dit dat andere flora en faunasoorten er ook goed gedijen

5657733 there are so many reasons why tera is such a sexual icon and her amazing breasts are certainly one of them

5657747 entweder holt sich der anwender eine open source l sung die allerdings in der regel nur mit fachwissen bedient werden kann oder er besorgt sich die module einzeln in diesem fall muss er drei l sungen parallel administrieren da sich freeware in der regel nur um eine art von schutz k mmert dann k nnen aber probleme in sachen kompatibilit t und arbeitsspeicherbelastung entstehen

5657763 the bottom line is that we need make the same big deal about violence by women as we do about men who behave violently

5657767 i was impressed with both your writing ability and with the amount of research that has obviously gone into the writing of zanzibar and so i asked others here to read the material the other readers were also impressed but not enough for us to make an offer the problem is this the market for historical novels is not particularly strong these days unless the author is extremely well known

5657807 die ums tze im fondshandel sind in der vergangenen woche erneut zur ckgegangen so dass sich aktuell nur noch diejenigen anleger im markt tummeln die immer aktiv sind eine art grundrauschen
5657808 in russland hat die beruhigung des georgien konfliktes f r eine ralley gesorgt vor allem bei den russischen aktien ganz mutige anleger die hier versucht haben mit limits auf der kaufseite zu arbeiten sind in den vergangenen tagen belohnt worden
5657809 im gesamten geldmarktsektor sind angebot und nachfrage in dieser woche ausgeglichen hier ist keine fluchtneigung zu erkennen die anleger f hlen sich scheinbar ganz wohl und bleiben in den produkten
5657810 es muss erst wieder vertrauen und ein bisschen mehr begeisterung in die m rkte kommen damit themenfonds wieder eine chance haben solange anleger nicht wissen was sie machen sollen greifen sie bestenfalls zum altbew hrten und wagen nicht den schritt zu etwas spezielleren produkten

5657816 there is a lot of misinformation floating around regarding plastic bags
5657817 when we begin to tell people about the upside of the bags theyre generally very surprised
5657818 people just go around thinking the bags are bad we try to show them the bags are actually better for the environment
5657819 times are tough businesses in the city havent had it easy so passing new costs on to them didnt really make any sense here
5657820 if you know youre going to need a bag people should grab something that they can use again and again
5657821 people just mindlessly consume plastic bags they dont even think about whether or not they really need them
5657822 people associate the litter they see to plastic bags and theyre tired of seeing it
5657823 i understand that but that has nothing to do with the bag or how theyre made
5657824 i will bring my own personal touch but there are still some certain starters because we have our way of playing
5657825 there will always be something of my particular style in the way the team plays
5657826 we have two qualifiers coming up and next year the confederations cup so there is little margin for error we need to start with the right mentality but the door is closed to nobody i worked at real madrid for 15 years applying similar criteria to that of the national team trying to bring through players and young talent obviously its not exactly the same job as with a national team where the work is not something thats carried out on a daily basis but the result is not all that different there are a lot of things in common with club football in that you are trying to achieve a style and to impose that style on the team
5657827 its wonderful to look back to euro and to enjoy what was achieved there but the players cannot just think about the past because they mustnt restrict themselves only to that achievement our objectives have to be to reach the top ive said that many times this doesnt mean that we can be petulant and that we mustnt keep our feet on the ground it means we have a team that is capable of achieving

5657845 it has been a long time since a game has been abandoned at windsor park and who could have predicted such an outcome in august of all months
5657846 in order to protect the sporting integrity of the competition it was agreed that all matches on matchday 33 should be played on the same day and with the strong possibility of international call ups resulting in postponements it was decided that this would not be in the best interests of football

5657848 j rgen klinsmann has told me that the national team players are short of their best because they have only been back in full training for three or four weeks therefore we shouldnt judge miro too harshly
5657849 i spoke to him before the euros but then he wasnt clear as to what had caused his dip in form my advice is to be a bit more selfish in front of goal
5657850 lets not say that ive reconciled with atl tico because everyone knows that i want to be here im very comfortable and ill give everything i have on the pitch

5657853 walcott is terribly unpredictable with his speed occasionally he lacks a little calmness but people forget hes only 19 when he plays well they say hes like maradona then he has two bad games and they write hes not improving at all and that he is stagnating
5657854 i think that it the breakdown will be a battle and whoever wins it will go a long way to winning the match
5657855 i think that south africa will probably feel that a few crucial decisions probably didnt go their way and it looked obvious from the stands that some calls really hurt them particularly when they were on the front foot
5657856 they could probably be a little disappointed in the way that worked out because i thought the springboks gave themselves a lot of opportunities and they didnt get to capitalise on them
5657857 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
5657858 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special
5657859 although finding an unknown species like the olive backed forest robin was not the goal of the project it is definitely a reminder that the world still holds surprises for us

5657868 yes thermodynamic limit classical limit can be obtained from quantum mechanics much in the same way thermodynamics is obtained from statistical mechanics
5657869 if a theory has no criteria to undergo an experimental check is not a theory and we have to forget about this
5657870 the usual separation of observer and observed which is now needed in analyzing measurements in quantum mechanics should not really be necessary or at least should be even more thoroughly analyzed what seems to be needed is the statistical mechanics of amplifying apparatus

5658014 government has not been unaware of the serious threat that cyber criminality poses on our economy at present there is an increased awareness of cyber crime and the need for enhanced cyber security by the security agencies
5658015 the economic and financial crimes commission efcc has been provided with the relevant tools to combat cyber crime effectively
5658016 government is opened to further suggestions and information that would help combat cyber crimes and also ready to support initiatives in this direction
5658017 people now trade their trust on line to agencies for information and services
5658018 government business has suffered several abuses in the hands of cyber criminals who now adopt all sorts of scheme to perpetuate fraud against unsuspecting public and internet users the absence of internet presence by majority of government organizations the practice of establishing office websites in domains outside the top level domain assigned to nigeria the absence of standardization and certification scheme for official communication all constitute the loopholes presently being exploited by cyber criminals to perpetuate on line fraud against government of nigeria and her internet resources
5658019 it is only through our collective effort that we can reduce crime to a negligible level in the society
5658020 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
5658021 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective

5658049 por mais que assistia a jogos do brasil l na gr cia voc perde um pouco da no o dos times dos jogadores acaba perdendo contato com dirigentes e at mesmo com o estilo de jogo brasileiro

5658062 im pushing the chair but she is the strong one
5658063 after going through charley this doesnt seem nothing more than a gust of wind
5658064 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5658065 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5658066 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
5658067 probably fannie mae and freddie mac despite what u s treasury secretary hank paulson said these giant mortgage guarantee agencies are not going to exist in their present form in a few years
5658068 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime theyre great buys sovereign wealth funds come in and make a lot of money by buying them
5658069 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink
5658070 at agora a disputa esteve entre massa e hamilton porque a atua o de r ikk nen teve muitos altos e baixos
5658071 neste momento massa melhor que r ikk nen no ponto de vista de pilotagem

5658077 i think it is absolutely regrettable that the leader of fiji has decided not to attend this forum rudd said today in auckland
5658078 it would have been far better for the leader of fiji to sit down with the leaders of the pacific island countries and answer to the commitments which have been previously given by fiji to fellow island states that is now not going to occur
5658079 we dont believe we can sit idly by while the principles of democracy are shredded and therefore the resolve of pacific island counties is to act in concert on this question he said
5658080 in our consultations with our fellow heads of government from the pacific island countries we are confronted front and centre with the impact of climate change on regional states rudd said

5658084 la idea es que los empresarios se lleven la inquietud de hacer un estudio sobre la posibilidad de que partes de su empresa se manejen desde el teletrabajo del lado de los candidatos se les capacita para que no lleguen a autoexplotarse por ganar m s dinero
5658085 supongamos que se determina que para complementar lo que el individuo recibe de la seguridad social y para que un nivel de gastos que considera adecuado necesita que sus ahorros le rindan 10

5658092 no llevaba nada pero lo intent porque vi que whitfield se quedaba pero al final ha vuelto a entrar en el grupo y no he podido hacer nada
5658093 lo que pasa es que el sabor que te queda de la dureza es mejor si ganas el oro

5658095 hemos tenido dos atletas en los puestos cuarto y quinto no puedo quejarme han estado en la carrera y han dado un buen espect culo

5658104 most investors both institutional and individual will find that the best way to own common stocks is through an index fund that charges minimal fees those following this path are sure to beat the net results after fees and expenses delivered by the great majority of investment professionals

5658107 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves
5658108 beginning to walk but by no means were they running
5658109 if that was a u s brigade it would not have gone into combat
5658110 from what ive heard a lot of the 4th brigade was hit pretty hard
5658111 some of the soldiers seemed really grateful for the things we taught them
5658112 come from the hills of georgia and some of them sign for their paycheck with an x
5658113 overall goal is to bring georgia up to nato standards
5658114 i know specifically that bravo company im sure and i hope from what i did for them that theyre better off than they would have been if this happened four weeks ago
5658115 it was not an absolutely decisive factor whether georgians were trained by americans or not
5658116 what happened was due to the political decision of georgian authorities and not the performance on the ground
5658117 im not saying that were suffering here with the one million thread count sheets or checking out the local females at the pool
5658118 but if our job now is to sit here and put down roots in the couch id rather do it at home
5658119 its to go there to get goals and games under his belt and then come back to us and be raring to go
5658120 i just felt it would benefit both the club and the lad for him to go and get some first team games
5658121 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5658122 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5658123 even the u s military which has a greater number of smart weapons sometimes accidentally hits civilians
5658124 they sent the tu 22 crew to their deaths thinking that the georgian air defense would mount no resistance
5658125 using the tu 22 for a reconnaissance mission over georgia was the same as using a microscope to drive nails
5658126 the victorious russia has found itself in complete isolation that raises the question of whether it was a victory
5658127 georgias military losses were higher than russias but financial political and moral losses of russia were much higher than those of georgia
5658128 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5658129 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5658130 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5658131 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5658132 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern

5658145 the metropolitan police authority is committed to ensuring that everyone working in our buildings are properly rewarded for their contribution and able to afford a decent standard of living
5658146 i am very pleased with this deal which will not only improve the standard of living for hundreds of people and their families but also help achieve better staff morale and higher productivity
5658147 the participation of a major company like toyota is a sign that private companies are increasingly playing their part on the road to a low carbon society
5658148 as energy prices are rising this government will take all practical steps to protect the public purse the national procurement of electricity will be important in minimising the impact of spiralling prices on the public sector
5658149 as well as getting best value for money this will support the governments efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and make scotland greener
5658150 we are doing all we can to relieve the pressure of rising fuel costs on scotland through a range of government programmes
5658151 our national electricity strategy move is a further step in the radical public procurement reform programme if maximum benefits are to be derived from this initiative it is imperative that take up of the contracts is as high as possible i therefore want all scottish public bodies to build on the excellent collaboration so far by committing to use the national contract in the future
5658152 2012 will be a massive test of the quality of our public space not just in london but right across the country when people gather in all the major civic spaces to watch and celebrate so are we ready local authorities have four years to get it right
5658153 i am very excited to have reached the 10th million electronic booking
5658154 it is significant because it gives a clear indication that choose and book is making good progress in becoming the nhss everyday method of referral
5658155 my patients have responded very positively to choose and book and i know that their endorsement has been replicated around the country
5658156 i am delighted to note how clearly the argyll local action group with the involvement of argyll and bute council has recognised the importance of agriculture fishing and forestry to rural scotlands prosperity
5658157 seeing these leader projects get underway is great news i am convinced that working hand in glove with the local communities they help sustain land managers can make an enormous contribution to the growth of scotlands rural economy
5658158 the argyll and bute agricultural forum for example has developed an action plan to help farmers adapt to recent changes
5658159 another successful group argyll food producers has had great success in promoting and selling argyll foods at music festivals across the uk including t in the park and the upcoming hydro connect
5658160 through leader the srdp is making a vital contribution to ensuring that rural communities throughout scotland can secure maximum benefit from a healthy and competitive agricultural sector
5658161 the remarkable thing about this project was the changes clients were able to make to their lives which surpassed the original expectations of the project in that clients achieved more than a return to work
5658162 aim high routeback has demonstrated that there is much scope for targeted health interventions both to improve health and support people back into employment it is the intention of the pct to roll out an employability health support programme in county durham with our key partners in the coming year
5658163 one of the main aims of the regional economic strategy is to get more people into work meeting the needs of employers for skilled and committed staff and reducing reliance on benefits and health services
5658164 aim high routeback has proved that the potential is there particularly with clients who have mental health conditions who can find it especially difficult to regain confidence and manage stress at work by involving more health expertise at the very start of the process getting health and employment teams working more closely together and making sure services can be tailored for each client it is possible for people who have been on incapacity benefit for a long time to go back to work successfully were delighted that this pilot has laid the foundations for a county wide programme in the future
5658165 in the north east the governments major national pathways to work programme is run by jobcentre plus and we work closely with a wide range of local partners to ensure that this and other programmes deliver the sort of help that people need to get back to work
5658166 its principally about ensuring that planning authorities engage at the earliest opportunity and co ordinate with the department of education and science in relation to schools requirements and their future provision before land is zoned or re zoned for substantial residential development
5658167 there are obvious synergies to be availed by my department in working closely with local authorities and to this end i have instructed my officials to commence work with the city and county managers association on agreeing the terms of a memorandum of understanding to ensure the efficient acquisition of sites is put into place as soon as possible
5658168 this code of practice is also emerging from the work underway under my developing areas brief to provide a new mechanism for the department and local authorities to support work at central and local government levels to secure better co ordination and timely delivery of key infrastructure and services in fast growing developing areas in parallel with housing development
5658169 this co ordinated approach is a significant step forward in ensuring all the key players have a clarity of purpose in fulfilling their part towards the common goal of delivering schools on the ground
5658170 from the local authority perspective we very much welcome the code of practice which reinforces effective early engagement with the department of education and science and key government departments in the development plan local area plan and development management processes this interaction will no doubt help to support optimal outcomes on school delivery within our cities towns and rural areas
5658171 the tragic deaths of conor james black in manchester and nilanthan murddi in croydon show why the work of the action programme is so important if you carry a knife you are now more likely to get caught more likely to be prosecuted and more likely to go to prison if found guilty
5658172 knife crime is a complex issue which we all need to work together to solve enforcement action is only one part of the solution i am pleased that later today the england football team will be supporting our marketing campaign it doesnt have to happen urging young people not to carry knives
5658173 i want to reinforce our commitment to tackling knives and getting them off our streets working with the police local authorities the health service and partners like the fa well do all we can to protect young people their families and communities from the fear and grief of knife crime
5658174 knife crime causes massive grief and pain to both victims families and their communities and that is why we have a duty both to the public and to the victims of these awful crimes to take a tough approach to those who carry knives
5658175 acpo is pleased with the work forces have been undertaking to tackle knife crime not only in the ten areas involved in the programme but in other forces too we need to ensure that we are tapping into all the good practice taking place across the service

5658202 in crucial games she steps up shell take the shots she reads the play well she doesnt look like much of a water polo player but shes got the brain and shes got the skills and shed have to be rated as one of the best players in the world

5658213 i love the focus of together for adoption it exists to make much of the gospel calling believers to understand and embrace their status in christ so that they can joyfully extend the love of christ through orphan care and adoption this is a needed emphasis in the church today and im thankful that together for adoption is sounding the call
5658214 this together for adoption conferrence is a wellspring of opportunity to further embrace gods wild and extravagant love for you as his child it is only natural that you will then reflect more of your fathers heart so dont be surprised if you find yourself waking up on the other side of the planet ready to lavishly pour out your life for the least of these the children who cannot speak for themselves it is my prayer that this conference will be a time of bathing our hearts and minds with the truth of who our father is and that he calls us his own adoption is the visible gospel
5658215 you will certainly hear the heart of god at the
5658216 i have the privilege and opportunity to speak in various places throughout the year and while i always look forward to each place there is one conference coming up in november that im especially looking forward to its the together for adoption conference in greenville south carolina not only will i have the privilege of sharing the pulpit with men that i deeply respect and admire but i really really believe in what t4a is all about

5658227 the economy is not as bad as people think it is or it has been reported upon as it pertains to employment
5658228 in this time period where we do have combat operations ongoing in iraq and afghanistan it is a source of pride for a lot of our u s employees that ge is actively sourcing veterans
5658229 that makes people feel good about the company they work for
5658230 if i had a choice between equal people and one has a military background i would take the one that has the military background
5658231 just think of the experience theyve had and the maturity they bring in most cases
5658232 they have leadership skills they understand discipline and execution all the things that it takes to be successful they have had a short course in and had to do it its not like its academic
5658233 the reason employers seek out veterans and they do is because of the discipline that veterans usually can bring to the workplace
5658234 the typical service member is really good at making sound decisions with incomplete information and limited time

5658239 a serial evictee will rent an apartment or home with no intention of paying rent other than the 1 month security to get in the place instead they plan to get evicted after they work the system for up to a year in free rent or cut a deal with the landlord to move out
5658240 i ran into a few of these clever folks one of my favorite stories involves an ingenious young woman who stopped paying rent and then staged her own lock out with a police report as proof knowing the penalty in nyc was triple damages plus legal fees she wanted my client a poor spoken immigrant to give her 6 months free rent or else my investigation uncovered the fraud turned out she was dating a law student who gave her the idea which she had used several times with success when i was cross examining her on the stand and she realized her cover was blown she literally bolted from the witness stand and tried to run out of the court room she was tackled by the court officer and hauled into the judges chamber along with her attorney only my compassionate client saved her from a new address with free rent at the city jail

5658439 now is an important time for people who care about the future of the internet to make their voices heard
5658440 conclusively show that spectrum sensing white space devices will cause harmful interference to wireless microphones during live events
5658441 simply stated the prototype devices were unable to consistently identify operating wireless microphones or distinguish occupied from unoccupied tv channels
5658442 an occurrence that takes place multiple times during any nfl game
5658443 the device did not operate in terms of transmitting a signal because it found that particular channel was occupied
5658444 there would be zero chance of causing any interference to the signals because in that situation there certainly would not be a transmission of the signal in the first place
5658445 seeing such a long outage during the very first few days makes us wonder if a free solution provided by google is actually pro enough for us we cannot correspond with schools in africa or partners in denmark and afford being out of mail for a whole day
5658446 i can give them a lot of credit for providing a free service but they lose some of that when saying your e mail is totally inaccessible and were not going to tell you why or for how long its arrogant im a system administrator so i deserve to know a little more
5658447 were quite busy leading up to the convention i have relied on gmail not only for e mail but for my primary contact list and was totally isolated for more than a day
5658448 i was on client deadlines and had to work around for re routes and resends of e mails from those clients
5658449 i do remind myself that im not paying for the service and that theres a level of patience and adequate backup youve got to have when youre getting something for free
5658450 we are doing everything in our power to make sure this doesnt happen again
5658451 i think youve gotten a serious black eye today we were finally getting management happy with the idea of using esx for production servers and this set us back
5658452 there is a full investigation under way to find out who is behind this
5658453 a significant number of unauthorized transactions had been made using wells fargos codes
5658454 many an it worker has been cursed with incompetent superiors
5658455 ive seen no win situations in the past where management set me up to take the fall and i protected myself too
5658456 this could very well have been written about myself if i decide to go rogue in my city
5658457 we are continually understaffed and typically not allocated the budget to handle the demands
5658458 theyre usually in the same state as we are in and unable to handle projects or even services in a constant manner
5658459 workers have been laid off and those left are being asked to pick up the slack they are having to work longer faster
5658460 im guessing that this was his mechanism for dealing with discomfort
5658461 the perception of jobs that he designs products in the middle of the night and builds them during the day has served apple well
5658462 people look at steve jobs in a lot of different ways being a good ceo being a good innovator being the messiah most of those perceptions are hard to shake
5658463 this is about one person giving a focused message and he delivers it very well
5658464 there are very few people that can deliver a message like steve other ceos only wish they had a fraction of the charisma that steve has
5658465 apple gets appointed as some kind of a poster child for that
5658466 but its not that far off from the normal culture
5658467 its a cultural style issue thats been in apples dna almost from the companys beginning
5658468 in almost every case even with john sculley michael spindler gil amelio apple ceos emerge as the company face and the public image
5658469 apples an us 18 billion company it didnt get there because of one man
5658470 whoever leads the company is going to have to be part of the apple culture you cant come in and learn it
5658471 to that degree steves doing a great job of building that cultural acclimation into his leadership staff if wall street truly understood that the company is driven by both vision and execution any impact from a future jobs departure will be minimized

5658480 an agreement is shaping up around a toughening up of the language as regards russia notably over its failure to respect yesterdays deadline on the withdrawal something which has evidently created a consensus
5658481 russia wants to be a respected international player and it can only be so if it lives up to its international commitments
5658482 i think its important that we dont pursue a policy of trying to isolate russia what we need is hard headed engagement but we will make sure its not business as usual
5658483 they entered the civilian port and kicked everyone out the russians arrested the port security staff 20 of them they are police officers

5658485 to have a michelin guide for hong kong will help us measure the quality of our culinary experience and keep us up to the standard with international gourmet cities such as new york and paris
5658486 its good to have a guide like that but we cant take it too seriously
5658487 chinese cuisines have so many varieties and even a guide like michelin cant represent everybodys tastes in food

5658492 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5658493 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5658494 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5658495 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5658496 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5658497 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5658498 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5658499 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5658500 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5658501 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5658502 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5658503 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5658504 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5658505 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5658506 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5658507 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5658508 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5658509 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5658510 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5658511 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5658512 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5658513 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5658514 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5658515 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5658516 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5658517 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5658518 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5658519 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5658520 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5658521 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5658522 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5658523 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5658524 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5658525 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5658526 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5658527 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5658528 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5658529 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5658530 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5658531 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5658532 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

5658547 we forecast a further near term rise in essential price inflation and qualitatively we see this as a risk that inflation expectations will remain at elevated levels through q4
5658548 the top two income tax brackets would return to 36 and 39 6 all other tax brackets would remain as they are today obama would work with the treasury department to adjust the thresholds of these rates slightly to insure that no married couple making less than 250 000 or single making less than 200 000 was affected by these changes
5658549 all other tax brackets would remain as they are today
5658550 families with incomes below 250 000 will continue to pay the capital gains rates that they pay today for those in the top two income tax brackets likewise adjusted to affect only families over 250 000 obama will create a new top capital gains rate of 20 percent
5658551 individuals with incomes below 200 000 is that just an oversight or should one assume that for capital gains and dividends individuals are families of size one

5658557 i just told them this could be your last at bat as a team
5658558 after merrell hit the home run i thought we were in good shape
5658559 i think ive just continued to get better in the preseason in the games and in practice so this will be another step to take
5658560 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5658561 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have
5658562 its amazing the chinese program has gone from nothing to gold medal standard in four years
5658563 chinese people are more and more interested and in love with beach volleyball
5658564 i think there will now be an unprecedented historical breakthrough in the sport of beach volleyball
5658565 the fact so many spectators have come will help develop the sport
5658566 we let it be known with the dodgers that was the one ballclub he had interest in going to that any deal we were going to do was going to be the best baseball deal we could do and it wasnt going to be a financial deal to try to move dollars we just werent happy with the prospect we would be getting back and we chose to hold onto him

5658568 with the resignation of president pervez musharraf the future of the u s pakistan partnership against terrorism may now be in doubt
5658569 the new pakistani government may or may not prove to be as reliable an ally as president musharraf has been
5658570 i dont think there would be any significant change in the policy because if the past 5 months are anything to go by i havent seen any change
5658571 the war against terrorism and extremism is our own war
5658572 its politically very difficult for the government to market this policy but it has to do it it has to convince the people that these militants are destroying the country
5658573 how good is a phone call when you cant speak
5658574 how good is the iphone 3g when there is no 3g network in the country
5658575 there is no other iphone model to sell so that is the only model available apple is pushing the 3g model very aggressively i think there are a lot of un locked or cracked iphone available in india but through this apple will get the indian market well the iphone 3g will run on 2g network as well so you will be able to do a lot of things like the internet access and other stuff but the experience will not be that good as compared to running these on a 3g network still since iphone is more about a style statement and the rich interface so at least people will be able to use it and flaunt it
5658576 besides this special consideration for bsnl and mtnl 3g bwa spectrum would be allocated through an auction process to be conducted by a specialised agency for the spectrum blocks released to them bsnl and mtnl will pay a price equal to the highest bid in the respective service areas
5658577 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5658578 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5658579 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5658580 there was no way of hiking back there was no way of getting out

5658584 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5658585 we just want to make sure its not a problem
5658586 he wanted to give them an idea of where he wanted to go with this
5658587 there was no whirring glass bubble like maxwell smart or something like that he was speaking to the integrity of the arrangement
5658588 he literally disabled it even if someone tried to turn it on it wouldnt work
5658589 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5658590 there is not one shred of evidence that its true
5658591 we are extremely disappointed to see that the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut
5658592 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5658593 i think you can expect a strong message to russia
5658594 decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era

5658596 in the first six months of 2008 the group succeeded in delivering a strong underlying performance both operationally and financially our mobile operations in hong kong and israel strengthened their 3g market leadership position during the period collectively passing two million 3g customers in indonesia we have seen good sales momentum since the launch of the service in the first half of 2007 and are pleased with the progress to accelerate the network rollout whilst in vietnam we have made progress on the conversion to gsm these steps enhance the groups prospect in those markets positioning us favourably to reap the rewards
5658597 there is evidence of some deterioration in our operating environment as the impact of higher inflation and lower growth affects consumer spending in some markets we are also mindful of the availability of capital and credit in view of the global situation however we are a well capitalised company and during this period would aim to maintain high levels of liquidity to ensure we can meet our operating objectives

5658620 we feel it is now time to invest in indian realty projects as the quality has moved up and we see emergence of some high end developers with a product level that will support our brand
5658621 the fund will be for acquisitions of real estate in the high end and across the spectrum
5658622 well start it off relatively small and grow it as we get more familiar with the indian market our entry has to be in mumbai and thats where everything is going on right now in terms of the high end real estate thats the place where one is going to achieve the highest prices per square foot it sets the tone for all of the other future developments

5658625 we expect headline inflation to possibly cross 13 percent levels with inflation likely to remain in the double digit range for the next few months and supply side measures not really being effective in bringing inflation down we expect the reserve bank of india to continue to raise rates to temper demand side pressure

5658647 from now on i knew i would be described as a communist but frankly i had reached the stage where i didnt give a damn too many people i respected as freedom fighters were listed as red for me to fear name calling
5658648 due to his associates and involvement in what were considered in the forties to be radical communist groups
5658649 however by the time he davis returned to chicago and the renaissance he inevitably associated with people connected with the communist party since they were most likely to be involved in civil rights labor art and the fight for equality it seems that davis did join the party for a short time although on other occasions he denied it
5658650 davis met richard wright through his 1936 participation in the national negro congress which was alleged to be a communist front organization
5658651 davis did not see wright again after openly criticizing wrights attack of sic the communist party following the latters defection although both men held on to the hope of equality
5658652 davis joined the league of american writers a national united front organization for the communist party mobilized by the alarming rise of power of hitler and mussolini
5658653 if the relationship with davis was as blas as the associated press makes it sound why is obama mum about it and why did he try to hide davis identity in his first memoir published in 1995
5658654 with the exception of my family and a handful of public figures the names of most characters have been changed for the sake of privacy
5658655 but there was no need to protect davis privacy he had long been dead more likely the cryptic references to his communist mentor were and still are designed to protect obamas background from the scrutiny it deserves
5658656 a history of the radical communist and working class movement in hawaii
5658657 it is not well known im afraid that before statehood in 1959 probably the most vigorous communist and radical trade union movement under the u s flag was in hawaii

5658660 tolerance and apathy are the last virtues of a dying society
5658661 continued open border policies along with violation of the rule of law will destroy all of america and all republics around the world how do we object to this takeover to whom do we cry out why isnt each states sheriff or attorney general calling forth the militia of the several states to close our borders deport all illegals stop the drug trade and coyotes bringing in more vermin to whom do we go to protect us my guess is keep your best friend ready oiled and loaded thanks
5658662 for what its worth our society is already so unsustainable that even if the population did not increase by one single person ever it will still crash it is so refreshing to hear common sense from a person who is thoroughly familiar with principles of ecology that i would jump for joy were it not for the fact that our society sure seems doomed as near as i can tell and based on the numbers given by the various ecologists which i have read something on the order of at least 80 of our current population is ecologically redundant the impression is also formed that what they refer to as overshoot occurred in about the year 1890 so this to me seems like an indication of how far out on an unsustainable limb we are having been living on borrowed or stolen resources for over 100 years now when the freight train collides with the stone wall its not gonna be pretty
5658663 you guys seem to get down primarily on mexicans and other latinos how come i never see you complaining about the various europeans that come here
5658664 i heard you on coast the other night and you were excellent
5658665 just to add my own two cents id like to say that i dont see much hope of stopping what is going on regarding the illegal alien situation
5658666 also one cant overlook the fact that europeans stole the land and therefore its tough to get onboard with any notion of problem solving that doesnt take into account guilt for past evil deeds as well as christian values that command us to view all of these millions of foreign born souls as being our brothers and sisters lest we be subjected to gods harsh judgment ourselves for being so cold and selfish
5658667 my own personal solution is to not have any kids and to remember that jesus said
5658668 i wish you well in your battle but within 10 years the wave of thought will likely go in the other direction with so called rap artists along with the offspring of millions of illegals will be leading the way in making it clear that
5658669 federal correctional officers like jose rivera courageously put themselves in harms way every day officer riveras death will not be in vain these two murderers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent under federal law
5658670 the bureau of prisons would like to thank and commend the united states attorneys office for their diligence in bringing this case forward this is an important first step in what we hope will be a relatively short process of bringing some closure to this tragic event we would also like to thank the fbi and our own bureau of prisons staff who were instrumental in the investigation of this murder

5658688 i will always work with ewan for example hes a phenomenal stage actor he delivers
5658689 and what i love about ewan is he says to his agents i want to do theatre he carves out the time
5658690 hes a man who has spent many years exploring every medium including opera and film as a director producer and writer
5658691 he had heard we were doing a season with seats for 3 50
5658692 hes on record as being behind the idea of accessibility hes the great inspiration behind me doing this wyndhams season
5658693 he was so prolific so young we all decided we knew what he could do but look at the places ken branagh is going now he probably always could but he was doing it as a young man and now hes doing it as a middle aged man
5658694 hes a phenomenal collaborator a real company leader he doesnt work in isolation
5658695 they have been working on it for quite a few months we get the theatre for them and they come and do a day on the stage
5658696 the idea that ken knows hamlet so well from being in it on stage on radio on film then turns director and offers something of that experience to a younger actor is very exciting
5658697 as you build a track record inevitably you get people who hear about it being a good experience and want to sign up
5658698 but dusty phrases meaning something juicy ensuring the lifeblood of theatre for the future
5658699 this is a landmark moment for us going into the west end doing this access for all season it is a great statement of the second half of my tenure at the donmar
5658700 what were hoping is that the whole wyndhams season will get audiences back in to see straight plays
5658701 its a play that speaks to me in some way a few years ago i did as you like it and it was a life changing experience it was a play that tackled the great themes of love and twelfth night is the even more perfect play about people coming together through the power of love
5658702 but i think its a good thing occasionally to get up in the morning and be open to romance i dont like it when i get cynical we live in a world where we look for an ulterior motive in everything but sometimes people do things for the good of them
5658703 every time i open a show i get some shitty review

5658726 der fp steht es besonders schlecht an sich ber die kriminalit tssituation und den personellen fehlbestand bei der sicherheitswache zu echauffieren waren es doch in der schwarzblauen regierung ihre vizekanzlerin und auch die wiener fp nationalratsabgeordneten die die damaligen weichenstellungen f r den rigorosen sparkurs bei der polizei voll mitgetragen haben noch heute wirken sich die sparma nahmen und diversen missgl ckten reformen bei polizei negativ auf die sicherheitssituation aus
5658727 damals hat die wiener fp die ma nahmen ihrer parteifreunde in der regierung und im parlament heftig verteidigt jetzt so zu tun als sei man gar nicht dabei gewesen obwohl man in wirklichkeit mittendrin gewesen ist wirft einmal mehr ein bezeichnendes licht auf die v llig unglaubw rdige politik der freiheitlichen

5658801 has just been chronically flawed from the time it was passed
5658802 theres no question this administration is coddling unscrupulous employers while arresting undocumented immigrants in order to make their statistics look good
5658803 the dysfunctional immigration system really is the fault of congress for failing to lead

5658828 the angle bounded by two radii that intercept a quarter of a circle one fourth of a round angle or one half of a straight angle two lines forming right angles are perpendicular to each other
5658829 in geometry and trigonometry a right angle is an angle of 90 degrees corresponding to a quarter turn that is a quarter of a full circle it can be defined as the angle such that twice that angle amounts to a half turn or 180
5658830 the angle formed by a line extended from another which bisects the angle formed by the line itself in half

5658868 esta acci n solo beneficia al empresario y va en detrimento de las arcas municipales
5658869 la carambola sortea dos sentencias que declararon ilegal la urbanizaci n del centro comercial y es una acci n de poca trasparencia ya que se ha realizado con excesiva celeridad y una vez que hemos estudiado el asunto despu s de lo publicado y declaraciones aparecidas en prensa entendemos que el ayuntamiento ha dejado de ser garante del patrimonio p blico tanto monetario como territorial
5658870 la empresa promociones horneras y jinur firmaron un acuerdo entre otros muchos con la administraci n auton mica en el a o 1998 por el que la empresa financiaba las obras de urbanizaci n por importe de 3 000 millones de pesetas la aprobaci n de la junta de gobierno viene a maquillar la realidad porque entendemos que la acci n de gobierno es lesiva al patrimonio p blico y a los intereses ciudadanos
5658871 lamentamos mucho la actitud del psoe que se ha plegado a las demandas empresariales y de su otro socio pol tico porque en definitiva no entendemos el cambio de actitud cuando en el a o 2001 el psoe manifestaba que el pmj era una ilegalidad manifiesta abril 2001 o cuando en marzo del a o 2003 present en el parlamento de canarias una moci n interpelando al gobierno sobre el pmj como colectivo ecologista no entendemos la actitud del concejal de urbanismo que quiere resolver este asunto por la v a de los hechos consumados
5658872 toda la colaboraci n para que el tema se reconduzca y se aclaren cuestiones como por ejemplo va a quedar el incumplimiento de la ley de costas o la infracci n urban stica por la invasi n de 20 000 metros cuadrados de playa o el amojonamiento de los lindes municipales o los yacimientos arqueol gicos d nde est el dinero de la monetarizaci n de parcelas que se firm en su momento por los t cnicos municipales o el exceso de alturas de parte del edificio principal del centro comercial son muchas las dudas y pocas las respuestas a tan grave cuesti n

5658951 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5658952 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5658953 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5658954 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5658955 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5658956 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5658957 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5658958 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5658959 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5658960 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5658961 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5658962 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5658963 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5658964 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5658965 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5658966 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5658967 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5658968 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5658969 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5658970 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5658971 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5658972 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5658973 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5658974 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5658975 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5658976 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5658977 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5658978 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5658979 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5658980 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5658981 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5658982 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5658983 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5658984 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5658985 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5658986 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5658987 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5658988 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5658989 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5658990 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5658991 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5658992 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5658993 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

5658997 we wanted to do something really different with the house of the dead overkill
5658998 with sega weve been able to create a fresh look for the franchise i think youll agree its like nothing youve seen before on wii
5658999 paying homage to the pulp horror comics and films that inspired generations of gore fans the house of the dead overkill will expose gamers to a brand new fleshy rollercoaster ride of revolting dismemberment
5659000 this is the hardcore wii title youve been waiting for
5659001 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5659002 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5659003 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5659004 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5659005 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5659006 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5659007 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5659008 this is a planning took where all things are going
5659009 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5659010 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5659011 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5659012 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5659013 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5659014 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5659015 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5659016 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5659017 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5659018 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5659019 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5659020 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5659021 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5659022 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5659023 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5659024 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5659025 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5659026 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5659027 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5659028 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5659029 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5659030 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5659031 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5659032 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5659033 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5659034 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5659035 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5659036 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5659037 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5659038 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5659039 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5659040 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5659041 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5659042 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5659043 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5659044 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5659045 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5659046 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5659047 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5659048 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5659049 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5659050 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5659051 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5659052 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5659053 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5659054 the cruspy is always already densely imbricated in both the crispy and the crunchy the double movement of the cruspy inscribes itself in both it plays on surfaces it crystallizes meniscuses
5659055 as long as the surface is intact the thing presents itself as impenetrable once it is bitten into it is no longer there in its thingliness at all and the question of its penetrability does not arise this is why the cruspy cannot be written
5659056 i dont know if it can be written or not
5659057 doesnt really matter im the only one who knows how to write here anyway
5659058 leanns home cookin just like granny use sic to make
5659059 this food is prepared as if by an elder woman
5659060 do you want to poison our people do you want to shrivel our testicles and make our arms too weak to hunt
5659061 do what you want with it shes been dead long enough there must be some kind of statute of limitations and anyway no one cares about structuralism anymore
5659062 there are many other post menopausal women in the encampment who only have to stay in their tents
5659063 the elders say they arent as zalaq as you are
5659064 they say that in all the history of the vendyak no woman has ever possessed zalaqtak to such a dangerous degree as you
5659065 they want you to stand in the lake up to your neck today
5659066 they say you need to go deeper the foods still coming out too crunchy
5659067 do you mean crunchy or do you mean something closer to crispy
5659068 youre going to have to go in all the way
5659069 just for the most dangerous period when the girls are tenderizing
5659070 its coming up through the reed and blowing towards the encampment
5659071 thats what the shamans are calling for the other elders just want to banish you they came with me to chase you into the forest
5659072 its a good thing you didnt say that during the banishment

5659087 but my worries were for them it was a choice between not having the surgery and dying or having the surgery and getting a chance at life
5659088 sophies operation brought together several procedures that have allowed heart surgery to develop and evolve into an extremely sophisticated speciality
5659089 it wasnt just a heart operation we replumbed the most critical part of the vascular tree the aorta which is the biggest blood vessel in the body and supplies the head and brain when you stop the circulation to operate on the brain you have only 40 minutes in total before you start getting brain damage
5659090 i was a sporty person and upset about not being able to do the things i loved
5659091 but my body had to work harder than everybody elses to keep up
5659092 they didnt know how hazardous it was until they opened me up
5659093 they had to take off the arteries to my brain and sew them back on looking back i can see what my body was up against
5659094 i couldnt sleep and was so uncomfortable i had to sit upright because of my ribcage which took six weeks to fuse back together i went home for a night sure i would sleep better
5659095 has been the effect it has had on beau and not being able to pick him up and cuddle him when i was away he started calling his dummy mummy because he was missing me and he still does
5659096 most people dont want to face another heart operation if they can avoid it
5659097 when my husband suggested i take the year off i was really grateful because it means i will get all this quality time with beau when he is small this is time we will never get back
5659098 i got emotional at the end because you see all the risks these surgeons have taken in the past 50 years
5659099 all those lives have been lost on the operating table so that i could have my surgery successfully i just felt so humble it really hammered home the point that heart surgery has come so far
5659100 als zij dat hadden gedaan dan had ik het goed kunnen doen
5659101 sorry ik heb nu geen tijd om me daar mee bezig te houden
5659102 wat zei je wil je dat ik het doe sorry maar zij zijn daar veel beter in en je wilt toch het beste resultaat of niet soms en daarbij heb ik er ook geen tijd voor want ik moet nog dit en dat doen
5659103 ze horen bij het jaargetijde namelijk nog even en ik ga pompoensoep voor je maken maar daarop moet je nog even wachten want de herfst begint nog niet ruik je al een beetje de herfst

5659137 well deal with the possibility of preemption when and if it comes up
5659138 my view is we need a statewide ban so motorists know what the rules are no matter where theyre driving
5659139 they the mayor and the d a have gone too far when they blame these two fine young lawyers as being part of the problem they are part of the solution
5659140 theres not going to be one this entire legal circus deserves no further attention or comment the mayor said what he said he meant what he said
5659141 is preparing for trial in the very serious criminal case against those arrested as a result of the district attorneys grand jury investigation we have no further comment about the civil case
5659142 the estate of danieal kelly by and through the administrators of the estate daniel kelly and andrea kelly
5659143 if theres a manner of obtaining for them compensation some benefits to make their lives a little bit better to help get them some schooling some education a decent home then it is incumbent upon any lawyer to attempt to get that for them

5659160 excuses for the employees outrageous lapses and for her own failure to administer any consequences for failing to do their jobs

5659162 but if everyone does it prices will just go up again as businesses try to cover their higher costs then well all be back to square one but with inflation still high this spiral has to be nipped in the bud and that means having interest rates at a suitable level until the threat of higher inflation has passed
5659163 some have looked to the mpc to cut its interest rate to help but our job is to fight inflation because thats the best basis for the economy to grow to create jobs and allow living standards to rise

5659315 i have thought it my duty to exhibit things as they are not as they ought to be
5659316 the stakes are too high for government to be a spectator sport
5659317 under democracy one party always devotes its chief energies to trying to prove that the other party is unfit to rule and both commonly succeed and are right
5659318 necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves

5659320 whatever evils either reason or declamation have imputed to extensive empire the power of rome was attended with some beneficial consequences to mankind and the same freedom of intercourse which extended the vices diffused likewise the improvements of social life
5659321 augustus was sensible that mankind is governed by names nor was he deceived in his expectation that the senate and people would submit to slavery provided they were respectfully assured that they still enjoyed their ancient freedom
5659322 there exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages and to magnify the evils of the present times
5659323 our youth now loves luxuries they have bad manners contempt for authority they show disrespect for elders and they love to chatter instead of exercise children are now tyrants not the servants of their households they no longer rise when elders enter the room they contradict their parents chatter before company gobble up their food and tyrannize their teachers
5659324 before impugning an opponents motives even when they legitimately may be impugned answer his arguments
5659325 idealism alas does not protect one from ignorance dogmatism and foolishness
5659326 let me never fall into the vulgar mistake of dreaming that i am persecuted whenever i am contradicted
5659327 we take and must continue to take morally hazardous actions to preserve our civilization we must exercise our power but we ought neither to believe that a nation is capable of perfect disinterestedness in its exercise nor become complacent about particular degrees of interest and passion which corrupt the justice by which the exercise of power is legitimized
5659328 faced with the choice of all the land without a jewish state or a jewish state without all the land we chose a jewish state without all the land
5659329 the darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis

5659331 the law in its majestic equality forbids the rich as well as the poor to beg in the streets steal bread or sleep under a bridge
5659332 when bad men combine the good must associate else they will fall one by one an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle
5659333 education does not mean that we have become certified experts in business or mining or botany or journalism or epistemology it means that through the absorption of the moral intellectual and esthetic inheritance of the race we have come to understand and control ourselves as well as the external world that we have chosen the best as our associates both in spirit and the flesh that we have learned to add courtesy to culture wisdom to knowledge and forgiveness to understanding
5659334 glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth that all deep earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous slavish shore
5659335 the most important political office is that of the private citizen

5659340 i contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole american people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof thus building a wall of separation between church and state
5659341 the sum of our religion is peace and unanimity but these can scarcely stand unless we define as little as possible and in many things leave one free to follow his own judgment because there is great obscurity in many matters and man suffers from this almost congenital disease that he will not give in when once a controversy is started and after he is heated he regards as absolutely true that which he began to sponsor quite casually
5659342 are we to have a censor whose imprimatur shall say what books may be sold and what we may buy and who is thus to dogmatize religious opinions for our citizens whose foot is to be the measure to which ours are all to be cut or stretched is a priest to be our inquisitor or shall a layman simple as ourselves set up his reason as the rule of what we are to read and what we must disbelieve

5659364 i know i have the ability once my foot recovered
5659365 now the most important thing is to heal my injury i still have a chance next year after all im still at the peak i must be optimistic and i shouldnt blame everyone and everything but not myself i will not easily give up
5659366 we all understand that liu quit the race due to injury
5659367 we hope he will relax and focus on recovery we hope that after he recovers he will continue to train hard and struggle harder for the national glory
5659368 iraqs insistence that its laws should prevail stems largely from the excesses of private u s security contractors
5659369 s johnsen is an idiot you always assume that americans are evil killers you related to john murtha all the iraqis have to do is scare off the contractors then have us leave too early and iraq will be a hell hole all over again and america wont be back to save them
5659370 do you idiots who pan the contractors realize most are former special forces they are not amateurs and know what they are doing if they cant do their job with efficiency then those they are guarding will die

5659374 saakashvilis petulant move has only served to highlight the failures of current us foreign policy and the continued petulance of washington can no longer be seen as a viable path either for europe or the united states
5659375 it appears this was well thought out and planned in advance and suggests a level of coordination in the russian government between the military and the other civilian agencies and departments that we are striving for today
5659376 the russian military is back they are to be contended with

5659383 in 1932 standard oil struck oil in the british protectorate of bahrain in the persian gulf and all the major powers began decades of covert and overt struggle to control that region of which the current culmination as i write includes george bush jr
5659384 when the oil prices plummet the oil companies will be gone quicker than fire through a gas line and all of us will be left picking up the pieces of our destroyed local economy

5659395 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog

5659449 our view is that there needs to be consideration in australia given to the development of a nuclear power industry dr nelson said
5659450 we need more rational discussion about nuclear power in australia and much less of the emotive political debate weve had in the last few years
5659451 we cannot envisage any circumstance under which australia will have a nuclear power industry he said then
5659452 the last election showed that australians are absolutely of one mind about not having 25 nuclear power plants dotted around their suburbs and in and around their cities mr garrett said
5659453 are they really saying that they have a plan for 25 nuclear reactors in australia where are they going to put them senator wong said

5659525 we have heard about suicide bombers on foot they are receiving indirect fire an officer in the isaf media office in kabul said
5659526 according to our reports about 30 taliban tried to attack the salerno base they were fired at we have found six bodies which were all wearing suicide vests he said
5659527 some of them have blown themselves up others are hiding in nearby houses and corn fields the troops are searching for them he said
5659528 he is on his way to ho chi minh city
5659529 he doesnt want to go back to the uk because hes had so many troubles there already
5659530 he wanted to go to another country like singapore or hong kong
5659531 the russian side is gravely violating the conditions provided for by the peace accord signed by the presidents of georgia france and the russian federation
5659532 we will do whatever is necessary and no one should have any illusion
5659533 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5659534 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5659535 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5659536 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5659537 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5659538 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5659539 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5659540 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5659541 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5659542 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5659543 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5659544 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5659545 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5659546 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5659547 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5659548 who are open to doing something on the production side
5659549 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5659550 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5659551 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5659552 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5659553 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5659554 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5659555 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5659556 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5659557 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

5659560 erkl rtes ziel f r die planung des hochhausprojektes des s ddeutschen verlages waren die minimierung von lifecyclekosten sowie die minimierung des prim renergiebedarfs bei gleichzeitig hohem thermischen und lufthygienischen komfort
5659561 aus sicht des nutzers ergeben sich durch green building weit ber die energetischen aspekte hinausgehende faktoren die f r uns als verlag sehr stark ins gewicht fallen von zentraler bedeutung sind neben wohlf hlfaktoren auch die positiven einfl sse auf die gesundheit arbeitsplatzqualit t und arbeitsklima
5659562 neben dem schonenden umgang mit ressourcen resultieren im umfeld kologischer immobilienprojekte f r investoren nachhaltige vorteile denn lebenszykluskosten k nnen reduziert und gleichzeitig immobilienwert und produktivit t gesteigert werden
5659563 bei der gestaltung des hochhauses f r den s ddeutschen verlag haben wir einen ganzheitlichen ansatz verfolgt denn es galt fl cheneffizienz nutzerkomfort und individualit t mit modernit t und schonendem umgang mit umwelt und ressourcen zu vereinen

5659572 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5659573 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5659574 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5659575 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5659576 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5659577 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5659578 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5659579 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5659580 i dont think i got my birthday kiss from you yet
5659581 i dont give birthday kisses just birthday spankings and never in public
5659582 what do you do after you spank your birthday girl
5659583 i fuck them in their red hot aching ass until they beg me to stop because they cant stand anymore pleasure
5659584 all for the better done right its something you will want to repeat and i can see
5659585 youre a girl who will take to it like a duck to water
5659586 give miss belindas regrets to the party and see that her friend sarah jean takes her things home she is leaving with me
5659587 yes sir mr wolf now you both have a grand evening
5659588 now you have had your birthday kiss and when we get to my house the spanking will follow
5659589 belinda push your dress down and let me see your fine breasts as we drive
5659590 you are beautiful why would you want to deny me the pleasure of seeing your body
5659591 you prepared your ass for fucking before the party why belinda my darling little slut what were you hoping to find
5659592 someone to show me how to get my ass fucked i wanted no i needed to find someone who knew how
5659593 when its time it will but we have a lot to do before we get that far my little beginner
5659594 now lay and enjoy your treat you took your spanking like a very good girl
5659595 i love a woman who appreciated my attention and we are far from done
5659596 oh god that feels so good your big cock is filling me so full and i am so hot i feel i could explode
5659597 i am wondering how that big thing fit inside my small ass last night and remembering how wonderful it felt when you filled me so full with your cr me
5659598 are you ready to fuck me girl i have yet to enjoy that pussy of yours with this cock
5659599 i am so full you are the biggest cock i have ever fucked
5659600 wake up small one or this ear will be breakfast
5659601 five minutes and join me in the shower then food
5659602 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5659603 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5659604 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5659605 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5659606 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5659607 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5659608 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5659609 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5659610 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5659611 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5659612 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5659613 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5659614 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

5659618 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5659619 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5659620 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5659621 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5659622 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5659623 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5659624 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5659625 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5659626 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5659627 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5659628 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5659629 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5659630 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5659631 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5659632 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5659633 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5659634 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5659635 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5659636 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5659637 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5659638 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5659639 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5659640 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5659641 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5659642 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5659643 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5659644 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

5659647 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5659648 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

5659651 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5659652 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5659653 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

5659696 the concept for the dress is derived from our interpretation of what a sophisticated woman would wear to an evening event in the year 3008 the design tries to reflect the evolving relationship between what we wear as clothing and what we understand as technology eventually technology will effortlessly be reflected in everything that surrounds us from what we wear to where we live this dress is a chic representation of that philosophy

5659702 but if everyone does it prices will just go up again as businesses try to cover their higher costs then well all be back to square one but with inflation still high this spiral has to be nipped in the bud and that means having interest rates at a suitable level until the threat of higher inflation has passed
5659703 some have looked to the mpc to cut its interest rate to help but our job is to fight inflation because thats the best basis for the economy to grow to create jobs and allow living standards to rise
5659704 no one has been ruled out but it looks like gerrard is ahead
5659705 di cercare non ho mai tralasciato e mai cesser di cercare questo mi sembra il mio destino
5659706 why would someone who doesnt go to church want to go to church
5659707 o you who believe fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you that you may attain taqwa
5659708 it is not righteousness that you turn your faces towards east or west but it is righteousness to believe in god and the last day and the angels the book and the messengers to give out of the things you hold dear to your kin the orphans the needy the wayfarer the one who asks and to free the slave and to be steadfast in prayer and to give for charity to fulfill the covenants you have made and to be firm and patient in times of pain adversity and panic such are the people of truth and such are the god conscious
5659709 have you seen one who belies judgment it is the one who repulses the orphan and does not insist on feeding the needy so woe to those who pray but are neglectful of their prayers those who are guilty of duplicity and refuse to provide for the ones in need
5659710 o messenger of god who is the most honored of people he said the one who has most taqwa they said this is not what we are asking about he said the best of them prior to islam is the best of them in islam if they comprehend the revealed message
5659711 verily the most honored of you in the sight of god is the most righteous mutaqi
5659712 whoever has taqwa of god he prepares a way out for them and he provides them from sources they never could imagine
5659713 verily the earth is gods to give as a heritage to such of his servants as he pleases and the end is best for the god conscious
5659714 will continue to have their enjoyment of life permanently lessened and impaired
5659715 these allegations be they true or false this one included theyre all turning points to a more open sumo
5659716 its good for the sport in the end it can open up the sport make them follow modern society
5659717 weve all read about the infamous it girls the young women whose time in the limelight is defined as much by their very public personal struggles as by their achievements and accolades
5659718 however the winners of the it girl essentials contest exemplify a whole new generation of women who are concerned active and effective in their communities and in their world
5659719 i am passionate about childrens rights and about bringing that message to all corners of the world
5659720 it is important for young women to be confident and realize how much they can affect the world if they put their mind to it
5659721 ortho womens health amp urology tm is dedicated to recognizing young confident reliable women who are leaders of their generation
5659722 the panel had a very difficult decision to make with hundreds of applications submitted many of these young women have accomplished so much already and most are not even 25 yet
5659723 traveling to a new country that youve never been to before is full of exciting adventures and challenges
5659724 ive been taking ortho tri cyclen r lo for the past 3 years and with the instability of traveling its crucial for me that my birth control is reliable
5659725 as a doctor i am glad to see that these women are taking the time to be aware of their birth control options
5659726 with so much going on in their lives a reliable birth control pill that may provide more predictable periods as well as a low rate of breakthrough or unexpected bleeding is important women should talk with their healthcare professional about the best option for them
5659727 we are proud to participate in the north canton main street festival
5659728 its an outstanding event and a wonderful opportunity to support the local community
5659729 arunas proprietary adherent monolayer culture technology creates millions of highly uniform cells these unique cells provide researchers with new enabling tools that can have a measurable impact on the advancement of drug discovery
5659730 we are targeting an early first quarter 2009 launch of arunas first hmsc kit
5659731 one of the most important uses of human embryonic stem cells will be in the generation of uniform populations of adult stem cells and progenitor cells it is thus exciting that aruna biomedical will be able to provide uniform cell populations of human mesenchymal cells in kit form this not only will be of value to bench scientists but also in advancement toward clinical therapies
5659732 gold partner accreditation and the status as the global fax solution for hp is a significant opportunity for captaris
5659733 the time is right for this the people of northern ireland want it eight out of 10 people in the recent life and times survey highlighted that they would like to live in mixed areas
5659734 supporting and encouraging neighbourhoods where everyone in the community is valued and respected and where diversity is celebrated is fundamental to building lasting peace and a stable society in northern ireland
5659735 its great news that the majority of attractions in northern ireland experienced an increase in visits during 2007
5659736 this increase reflects the success of northern irelands tourism industry as a whole with over 2 1 million visitors last year the highest figures on record
5659737 we look forward to welcoming even more visitors to northern ireland and will strive to provide the best possible visitor experience
5659738 we cannot go on in a position where we are subsidising scottish television and ulster
5659739 i absolutely refute the notion that utv is in any way subsidised by itv
5659740 itv has taken a position on this that is not only wrong headed but it is also deeply misleading
5659741 under no circumstance will we pay a penny more to itv for the current content they provide
5659742 i firmly believe we are already overpaying and im in dialogue with ofcom to address this specific point my intention is to reduce the fees not increase them
5659743 itv gets subsidy benefits from repeating itv1 shows on its digital channels and from on air cross promotion that we carry and weve never seen any of that returned to us
5659744 that old chestnut again the debate on whether a womans place is in the home or in the workplace just to keep things interesting lets try looking at the subject from the other end of the telescope round about now thousands of girls all across northern ireland have just received their hard won a level results for many it will be a passport to university and the first step towards a worthwhile career in say medicine the law teaching engineering or business should we stop these young women in their tracks with dire warnings that they risk damaging their own and their future familys well being by going out into the world to make the most of their abilities and talents of course not we wouldnt want to say it and they wouldnt want to listen intelligent and able girls today arent going to fight shy of the top jobs the genie is well and truly out of that particular bottle but the harsh facts of working life will have to be faced sometime lets be honest here were not talking about women in the workplace but specifically mothers in the workplace almost always motherhood carries a career penalty no matter what the legislators would have us believe and whats scary is that nowadays all too often the most high achieving working women are riskily delaying motherhood or opting out of it altogether many other women who want to make room for family life settle for a job rather than a career either deliberately avoiding or regretfully bypassing the promotion they would be well able for working mums work for all sorts of reasons in order to meet the mortgage and the bills to get out of the house for the company or to avoid being driven quietly mad by postman pat on a continuous loop variety and a modicum of financial independence is the spice of life which is why part time work is the preferred option of so many working mothers mums arent workshy nearly eight out of 10 women with children aged six 13 work outside the home and its calculated that by 2010 80 of new entrants into the workplace will be women as a mum of four and a working mum for the past 23 years there came a time when the workplace didnt suit me since all i need to work is a phone a laptop and five minutes peace i relocated my workplace to my home that arrangement has suited me and my family just fine for the past decade but i appreciate its rather different if your job is to operate on a heart patient build a flyover or operate a supermarket check out you cant do any of those at the kitchen table happily things have changed for women since i stopped being an employee with far better maternity leave provision and at least the possibility of flexible or shared working patterns thanks to some hefty euro law arm twisting and a slow dawning on the more savvy employers that it makes bad economic sense to lose skilled and expensively trained staff by trying to shoehorn women into workplaces made by men for men but legislation alone cant deliver nearly 40 years after equal pay laws were first passed womens earning power still lags behind with factors such as child care responsibilities and part time working patterns putting on the brakes and of over 3 000 recent discrimination cases one third centred on gender issues more than 30 years after the sex discrimination act as well as employment law attitudes need to change with an end to the long hours culture and the adoption of truly flexible working for a start its tough out there working mums survive by compromise id hate any bright and ambitious young woman tearing open those a level results to eventually be browbeaten into an all or nothing attitude to a career life has more to offer we cant have it all any fool knows that but with careful management we can have most of it much of the time it stands to reason that its easier to give your all to your job if the biggest responsibility you have at home is a cat but remember when retirement comes around all youre left with then is a gold watch and a dead cat
5659745 my granny was 86 years of age and she had a long life yes but she died a horrible death
5659746 there didnt seem to be any attempts at that stage to isolate the ward or other patients a few occasions when people had visitors in and they would come over to talk to us and you felt like saying go away please stand away from us but we didnt know what to do for the best
5659747 we felt very strongly at the fact that other families were not aware
5659748 staff are running with limited resources but they need to be more upfront with families and make families aware
5659749 as soon as the patient is diagnosed the ward is informed and they take measures so it doesnt spread
5659750 our priority is to get the patient isolated as soon as possible
5659751 we have had a few complaints over the phone and face to face about the rabbits eating the fresh flowers that people have placed at the graves
5659752 we have also spoken to people who do not want them to come to any harm at this stage they havent started to burrow in the cemetery but obviously that would be our concern
5659753 we had to talk to the uspca and our own people in pest control and take guidance from them and now it will be up to the council to make a decision
5659754 following reports from an garda siochana of an incident in the castleblayney area shortly after 8
5659755 just over halfway through the beijing games and team gb has put in one of its best ever performances
5659756 in september our paralympians will i hope return from beijing having achieved similar success so to reflect the excitement and pride of the country in our athletes superb victories weve set a date in the diary now when we can cheer all our heroes and honour their extraordinary feats at this summers games
5659757 fitting tribute to the outstanding achievements of the whole team
5659758 we have to get behind him because he is a tremendous force and is of tremendous importance for the team
5659759 what happened in the transfer period did not always reflect his deep desire and there was manipulation from agents on both sides but overall i am positive he will recover
5659760 it was certainly a great bonus for me to have been involved against dublin and obviously i would love to keep my place in the side but that is a decision for the manager prior to the game dublin had been rated as warm favourites and i was particularly pleased to share in what was a very satisfying win for tyrone
5659761 pearse og had players like ronan clarke in action who had played for armagh against wexford and the outcome of that game must serve as a big warning to tyrone we know that while we will be made favourites we are in for a very tough time wexford not only beat armagh but they will have learned a great deal from that game into the bargain which will now stand to them
5659762 manager mickey harte and captain brain dooher have been warning us that there is a long way to go we are keeping our guard up for wexford thats the big one
5659763 tommys receives very little government funding so any donations we receive from individuals make an enormous contribution to our valuable research into miscarriage stillbirth and premature birth
5659764 through the each one counts scheme people can still help raise money for tommys without needing to face any additional costs which is crucial during a period of economic uncertainty
5659765 recycling unwanted mobile phones and used inkjet cartridges with each one counts is a great way to support us if money is tight
5659766 we want supporters to know that if they have less spare cash in their pockets they still have a great way to support the work we are doing by recycling items that are probably gathering dust in their kitchen drawers or being thrown in the bin
5659767 we also discovered that people will be less likely to donate clothes or household items to charity during the credit crunch presumably because these items hold their value in this economic climate and cannot be replaced as easily
5659768 so its all the more important that every possible mobile phone and used inkjet cartridge that can be recycled is donated to a charity
5659769 id like to get the algerian but dont know if i can
5659770 it would only be a loan we have a problem on the right too we need someone with pace
5659771 we didnt follow players we didnt talk and we didnt communicate
5659772 we talk about respect but when it is completely unfair it is hard
5659773 the worst thing is when you say politely what you think and try to understand the decision you get a yellow card i had a yellow card at the community shield the same way i say i respect people the way they respect me
5659774 we are supposed to respect the rules and the referee but it goes both ways they have to respect the players too
5659775 its hard to tell if he will be at birmingham when the transfer window closes but at the minute im there unless im told otherwise i wouldnt entertain a move to glasgow im happy to be playing outside scotland at the minute especially with the kind of press thats been going about for rangers and celtic
5659776 on the night of the keirin saturday when i had the time trial for the sprint the next morning it took two hours to go through the whole procedure it was the most ridiculous drawn out process people were sitting round waiting they just didnt have enough people it was very disorganised and very unprofessional i didnt get a meal until after 11 30 that night and i was racing first thing the next morning obviously the doping control is there for a reason and im glad its there but it could be done a bit better
5659777 that is a huge source of concern the westlink is strategically a very important route and it was opened with great fanfare and welcome a few months ago and to find that in the first serious weather incident it is completely flooded out is a huge concern
5659778 that is where the motorway was built 40 years ago and it didnt leave much choice for us but to build there
5659779 clearly in this case there was a very abnormal pattern of rainfall and it didnt cope with that both myself and the general public would like to hear some answers as a matter of urgency as to what went wrong and how we intend to cope with that in the future
5659780 our priority has been to get the underpass open to traffic and now we are asking roads service with the contractor to investigate as a matter of urgency what did go wrong and what steps we can take to prevent it happening again
5659781 sometimes people get passed between a large number of agencies we are striving to get a single number in place that wont stop the rainfall but often a complaint after these incidents is about the ability to contact the authorities we are hoping to have something moving on that in october
5659782 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5659783 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at us 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
5659784 especially since there is a clear lack of buying momentum
5659785 the 5 price point is an important part of the new vernacular in the restaurant industry
5659786 its become a price point that consumers respond to and we see an opportunity to increase the quality of choices with our slow roasted rotisserie chicken meals
5659787 were placing greater emphasis on communicating how our rotisserie chicken meals are truly a cut above other chicken options
5659788 because we are cooking throughout the day and hand carving to order we believe we have a significant product quality advantage
5659789 we have amazing waves today something not seen very often on this beaches its a perfect day
5659790 have you ever been hit by a coconut well those things are worse than bullets they do not travel at high velocities very often but when they do they make a big hole
5659791 not only that we have branches that can take off somebodys arm
5659792 my greatest concern is that our public safety officers will end up getting injured because somebody is not using their brains
5659793 with devices built on the android platform users will be able to fully tailor the phone to their interests they can swap out the phones homescreen the style of the dialer or any of the applications they can even instruct their phones to use their favorite photo viewing application to handle the viewing of all photos
5659794 android breaks down the barriers to building new and innovative applications for example a developer can combine information from the web with data on an individuals mobile phone such as the users contacts calendar or geographic location to provide a more relevant user experience with android a developer could build an application that enables users to view the location of their friends and be alerted when they are in the vicinity giving them a chance to connect
5659795 new equipment that meets ustranscoms military requirements will help to create a new class of automatic identification technology ait products within the military
5659796 from the start the sx1 was designed and packaged to operate within a military environment whereas most devices are developed and packaged to less stringent more commercial standards
5659797 we have every confidence that the sx1 will meet the stringent criteria required by ustranscom and look forward to working with them to make deployment of high value assets more efficient and secure
5659798 this is the first time standardized environmental testing will be applied to satellite tracking devices in what is easily one of the most demanding logistics environments
5659799 meeting our military requirements insures the devices we purchase can meet the unique demands of our war fighters deployed worldwide
5659800 statements contained in this press release concerning numerex that are not historical fact are
5659801 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
5659802 that is to possess the concept of five you need a word for five
5659803 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognising and representing numerosities and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks
5659804 for example children were asked to put out counters that matched the number of sounds made by banging two sticks together
5659805 they had to use an abstract representation of for example the fiveness of the bangs and the fiveness of the counters
5659806 we found that warlpiri and anindilyakwa children performed as well as or better than the english speaking children on a range of tasks and on numerosities up to nine even though they lacked number words
5659807 for years the centers for medicare and medicaid services noted they had fewer than a dozen people exclusively dedicated to medicaid fraud enforcement they relied on the state agencies like the medicaid fraud control units within each state attorney generals office now cms have significant additional funding 50 million in both fiscal years 2007 and 2008 and 75 million in 2009 to attack systemic fraud waste and abuse as a result there is a very significant initiative at the federal level not only to fund more fraud enforcement efforts but also to create programs that ferret out fraud through data matching data mining and where necessary the hiring of contractors to go out as third parties to look for fraud waste abuse or errors
5659808 operating an organization within the health care industry can be like having three different customers with three sets of unaligned rules to comply with when selling your product or service providers must meet the requirements for those three specific customers that is medicare medicaid and commercial insurance even when their regulations conflict even in the best run most compliant organizations a third party review of the organizations business relationships accounting records and e mail could result in identifying potentially fraudulent claims or other errors or omissions that may otherwise form the basis for a claims investigation
5659809 in pursuing this project i looked everywhere for the means to produce the actual pieces
5659810 my works unique specifications proved a perfect match for the exceptional capabilities of the connex500 tm system enabling me to realize my vision

5659820 federal correctional officers like jose rivera courageously put themselves in harms way every day officer riveras death will not be in vain these two murderers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent under federal law
5659821 the bureau of prisons would like to thank and commend the united states attorneys office for their diligence in bringing this case forward this is an important first step in what we hope will be a relatively short process of bringing some closure to this tragic event we would also like to thank the fbi and our own bureau of prisons staff who were instrumental in the investigation of this murder
5659822 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
5659823 neither would have happened if it had been left to the bureaucrats and educational establishment

5659829 the new programme is designed to meet the needs of those aspiring to become chartered surveyors and or chartered town planners concerned with securing the public interest in land and property development
5659830 said professor lloyd who recently joined ulster from liverpool university
5659831 importantly the ulster graduate will be alert and sensitive to the important synergies that exist and which allow for appropriate responses to change and the management of that change in the wider public interest
5659832 with the new planning and property development course the university of ulster is leading the provision of innovative and cutting edge education in this discipline
5659833 the course is unique in northern ireland and indeed the island of ireland because of the integrative approach to study across four years

5659847 he has took up this bold attempt to change his hairstyle for suit the more mature and manly concept set for this new big bang minialbum and his new bold hairstyle has not only roused the concern of fans and media in korea but also in japan when big bang went over for promotion
5659848 gdragon has been receiving a lot of attention on his hairstyle ever since the lies days last year back then he was known for his apple hairstyle or duck hairstyle when he tied up his fringe
5659849 he attempted hairstyles that most men have not and did not tried out after the apple hairstyle he went on to change to the bangs a style popular amongst the females and which also is a challenging hairstyles for males

5659856 demonstrated that context should be taken much more widely to include not just the learning of humanists but also practical skills and not just those of the elite such as dancing and manners but also those of the merchant and the artisan such as the valuation of minerals and the gauging of barrels

5659875 for qantas malaysia airlines e amp m only handles heavy maintenance work for its b737 400 aircraft to date malaysia airlines e amp m have only done heavy maintenance for one aircraft registered as vh tju
5659876 the pilots allegations were totally baseless qantas has confirmed that the aircraft was maintained in australia and is totally unrelated to malaysia airlines
5659877 qantas has stated that the air conditioning fault on the aircraft is unrelated to heavy maintenance checks done in malaysia
5659878 regarding the heavy maintenance work for vh tju there is no basis to the
5659879 the maintenance in malaysia was done with the oversight of qantas personnel a total of 12 qantas engineering personnel were positioned at malaysia airlines e amp m to provide technical oversight in the course of the maintenance defects were found and all these were rectified after approvals by qantas personnel the aircraft flew back to australia
5659880 as for the case of a qantas flight attendant experiencing a static mild electric shock we have investigated and identified the root cause of the issue although it is not possible to ascertain if the defect originated from the work at malaysia airlines e amp m this will be monitored for future similar work to eliminate such instances from recurring

5659890 i dont see any other brand being able to build that kind of market in refurbished products
5659891 apple is the only brand i see being able to pull off something like that i dont see any other brand being able to have that kind of following for refurbished products
5659892 generally here in the u s the ipod cool factor is something that continues to drive apples success whether its with a next generation iphone or ipod touch
5659893 its such a phenomenon that everyone seems to be wondering whats coming next
5659894 weve been offering repair services for ipods since march since the beginning we started buying broken ones well service them in a large batch well take and sell those refurbs on some other site
5659895 one of the biggest changes was at amp t was officially subsidizing the phone and they wouldnt let you buy them without a contract
5659896 anyone who wants an iphone has to go through at amp t and all the hassle and contracts and all that
5659897 some would go to consumer to consumer sites like ebay
5659898 we decided to facilitate that secondary market and offer both buyers and sellers an option of where they can get their iphones bought and sold
5659899 right now were in the stage where were just trying to buy a lot of them
5659900 we actually have an official iphone buyback program for fully functional first generation iphones
5659901 weve had a ton of response a lot of people submitting information
5659902 basically they just go to the web site hit the iphone buyback link fill in the information and when they submit it well e mail them a shipping label for them to send it to us you just pack it up safely and ship it to us well verify everything and write them a check
5659903 if youe looking to upgrade to the new iphone and you already have a contract with at amp t that covers most of that
5659904 its really easy and youre working with a reliable vendor
5659905 although its only 200 for a new iphone in the store theres a hidden subsidy youve got 40 a month for the basic phone service and 30 for web connection and 5 a month for 200 text messages
5659906 by the time you have taxes and fees its probably 85 a month for 450 minutes most people are probably spending 100 for more so even though the phone itself is technically cheap there are a lot of hidden costs there
5659907 theres always more problems in selling used computer equipment it doesnt move as fast its not as portable even with the laptops
5659908 most people are going to want to keep a laptop for at least two years after that its not a lot of use to somebody else the main function of the ipod on the other hand is that it plays music laptops built in 2001 would no longer run the kinds of applications needed to run today
5659909 i think people are more likely to keep the device with computers through its useful life until its core functionality is reduced
5659910 theres always going to be a market for a hot product used or otherwise
5659911 looting of a bronx charity to finance the start of liberal radio network air america
5659912 this is one of the big obstacles that we have theres an issue that second hand is seen as second best
5659913 we try to differentiate between remanufacturing and all the other terms that are bandied about like refurbishing and refitting
5659914 we have a formal definition bringing end of life products back to as good as new with a warranty to match
5659915 only by addressing these barriers will we get people to recycle more things more often
5659916 good communication about their recycling service is vital but it will not persuade people to use services which are unreliable or too complicated
5659917 we are exploring all options however it would be premature to say that a sale is imminent

5659926 the right kind of guy is going to represent the university and never embarrass the university lets keep in mind weve got 18 21 year old kids they are going to make some mistakes but in our program they know they are going to be accountable before we even get to that you make certain because you cant watch these kids 24 hours a day you better bring in kids that have made good decisions in the past so were looking for a kid thats accountable responsible when were talking to a guidance counselor or if were talking to a coach we want to know that this kid has made good decisions thats part of what the right kind of guy is
5659927 you have to create a collegiate atmosphere and its the catwalk its the band its the fans its the students that were coming out in thousands for our football games and i believe that before you could build this program the right way you have to have a collegiate atmosphere i think weve really hit that this past year and its only going to get better
5659928 you might recall last years west virginia game where there were a lot of west virginia fans sitting in our reserved section because they went online and purchased those tickets even bought season tickets so they could be in our seats i think we have to continue to move forward in that direction relative to games that you can get to we should have a great crowd at louisville theres no reason why we shouldnt have a good crowd at west virginia and even at marshall those are areas that you can drive to so i think cincinnati has to start to show themselves now on the road during the regular season because it is a huge advantage for our players when we pulled into legion field at the 2007 papajohns com bowl in birmingham there was a great throng of support just as our bus pulled in it was just overwhelming for our players and it definitely makes an impact when our alums and our supporters are out there for us
5659929 to come out this year and not have a good season would be probably the worst thing that we could do for this program because it has to keep its momentum because we do need more seats theres no question about it we do need practice fields but those only come when you show a consistency in your program so really we need our fans to come out in throngs we need to have that same kind of atmosphere because it helps our football team prepare and play well this is a huge year for us in terms of building that consistency that is so needed in this program
5659930 one you want to play teams that are bcs caliber because obviously they get you the recognition through rankings and visibility relative to television two you also want to be able to play teams that give you an opportunity outside a rugged big east schedule the opportunity for success you want those opportunities for bowl games and those kinds of things that i know our alums would love to have
5659931 the university of cincinnati gives you so many opportunities to reconnect whether it is through local events in your own back yard or coming back to campus for a music recital or coming to nippert stadium or watching a baseball game there are so many opportunities stay connected to the university of cincinnati because we have just begun to move to the level that i think everybody sees this university
5659932 as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is flawless
5659933 we are extremely proud to work in partnership with the big east and the university of cincinnati said les vann vice president and general manager of local 12 wkrc
5659934 this is another cornerstone of our commitment to provide high quality high profile local programming
5659935 as the big east conference continues to cement its name as the premiere college athletics conference in the nation it is important we continue to grow the product locally in cincinnati
5659936 with the big east package being on local 12 wkrc our fans across the tri state will have expanded comprehensive coverage of
5659937 we are excited that that wkrc and the big east have once again partnered to bring sports fans in the tri state the best of bcs bowl championship series football
5659938 for a city like cincinnati it is important to give our fans which are so loyal to the local teams the opportunity to follow us all season long as we compete for a big east championship and a spot in a bcs bowl game
5659939 cincinnatians want to know their sports personalities on a personal level and we are excited that local 12s commitment to getting the story behind the story will now also focus on uc sports
5659940 the catwomendo brand covers each of our 10 womens sports at uc along with signature events like the womens cross town shootout and the upcoming state farm vernon manor bearcat invitational for our volleyball program tara has a knack for telling interesting stories about athletes and her involvement with this program will be a major boost to getting the word out about these great programs

5659960 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5659961 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5659962 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5659963 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority

5659974 i have concluded that it would not be appropriate for an unelected official to chair a body which is responsible for most of the money and a large part of the brief of an elected mayor i also agree with the mayor that my position as adviser does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority or the title of first deputy mayor we have therefore decided to adjust the management structure and abolish that position
