8340000 if we do win a championship it would mean a ton more than 03 i think
8340001 the drought seasons in 04 and 05 definitely make you respect things a lot more feel gifted in that you have the opportunity
8340002 so anytime you even win a race you thrive on it a little more
8340003 i think you definitely get recognized a lot more especially in indy which is where i live
8340004 theres such a history there and people love that race and i probably get a little more respect too
8340005 i think if helio wins the next two races we just have to place fourth so we should be able to do that
8340006 we just have to stay behind him were ok we have a long way to go yet
8340007 i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
8340008 electronics giant apple is on the verge of opening a store in belfast

8340014 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8340015 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8340016 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
8340017 that young democracy has been subjected to an unjustified assault
8340018 we support their democracy and we will work with our allies to ensure georgias territorial integrity as a free and independent nation
8340019 invasion of a sovereign and democratic neighbor and its recognition of the georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia
8340020 the georgian people won their freedom after years of tyranny and they can count on the friendship of the united states
8340021 its a moment of national solidarity the opposition has called a moratorium on open differences with the government because the country is occupied
8340022 i think there will be a few months before people think about making political trouble for the government
8340023 the last thing i wanted to have here is being vindicated in this way but the point here is at least its high time to open your eyes and see what we are dealing with
8340024 i believe our people is consolidated as never before on that point russia has grossly miscalculated the point here is its not about me any more the nation has got more mature democracy will become more vibrant and the long term effect will be exactly the opposite to what they intended
8340025 people are now outraged with russia it greatly strengthens saakashvilis position internationally no question but domestically as well
8340026 his political situation has been shored up inadvertently perhaps by this russian move
8340027 i hope the international community will not limit itself only to statements but will shift to real action soon
8340028 but the time will come when the georgian society will start to ask them questions about what has happened to our country
8340029 union negotiators worked late into the night to prepare our counter offer and will be delivering it to boeing today
8340030 what weve committed is that this is too important to play those kinds of games
8340031 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8340032 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8340033 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8340034 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8340035 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8340041 i think baseball will like it anything to help get the calls right
8340042 it has worked better than anyone expected u s open tournament referee brian earley said
8340043 ive heard people say that tennis set the standard for the introduction of replay
8340044 we made sure the players had confidence in it we knew that if we didnt do that and then it failed it would be years before we could try it again
8340045 you can make all the right calls you want but if the players dont have confidence in it its a recipe for disaster he said
8340046 i think it will work great in baseball it will add to the enjoyment of the spectators
8340047 football does it basketball too why not in baseball the tradition he said after his first round loss tuesday to former u s open champion marat safin
8340048 itll be good for baseball the world changes things evolve thats the way things go

8340053 i have all the respect in the world for john cena ive known him for a long time he has great determination and hes incredibly focused
8340054 john has overcome many hurdles and has blown through any barrier in his way he has changed our industry in many positive ways i think this surgery if anything would help get john the rest he needs the guy is constantly going all the time hes a freak of nature
8340055 right now its good for a lot of guys who are in title contention because john cena is not involved however john cena will be back and they will have to deal with him when he returns
8340056 im happy to hear that the surgery was as successful as it was
8340057 it wouldnt surprise me if before long after getting out of a hospital bed that john cena is going to be training
8340058 cenas work ethic and toughness dont really surprise me im just really happy that this surgery worked out well for him
8340059 john cena has proved in the past with his pectoral injury just how tough he is hes a mutant an alien
8340060 two hours after having surgery on his disk hes at the arena with a band aid on his neck saying hello to everybody
8340061 i feel great dr maroon is fantastic he explained every possible procedure he could and could not perform and the potential risks of all of them
8340062 i explained to dr maroon not only my immediate goals but also my long term goals he took them all into consideration and recommended the most commonplace procedure with the least amount of side effects
8340063 the fusion surgery was so successful because we used a gillette fusion razor
8340064 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men fifteen other villagers were wounded or otherwise injured
8340065 this is matter of grave concern to the united nations i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
8340066 the patience of the afghan people has run out we no longer can afford to see the killing of our children
8340067 i want to remind all parties engaged in the conflict that the protection of civilians must be their primary concern they must respect their duties under international humanitarian and human rights law to protect the people we are here to serve

8340082 we now have the widest gap we have ever had between republicans and democrats
8340083 its the most powerful predictor of party id and partisan voting intention

8340085 america is great because she is good and if america ever ceases to be good america will cease to be great
8340086 our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other
8340087 the notion that it is improper to look beyond the borders of the united states in grappling with hard questions has a certain kinship to the view that the u s constitution is a document essentially frozen in time as of the date of its ratification
8340088 appeals to a common sense of what judges roles ought to be in a properly functioning constitutional democracy judges are not to overturn the will of the legislative majorities absent a violation of a constitutional right as those rights were understood by the framers
8340089 to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions is a very dangerous doctrine indeed and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy
8340090 i had someone ask me in this process i dont remember who it was but somebody asked me you know are you going to be on the side of the little guy and you obviously want to give an immediate answer but as you reflect on it if the constitution says that the little guy should win the little guy is going to win in court before me but if the constitution says that the big guy should win well then the big guy is going to win because my obligation is to the constitution thats the oath
8340091 the american people will never be able to regain democratic self government and thus shape public policy until we curb activist judges

8340106 why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go a university why is it that my wife is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright is it because they didnt work hard my ancestors who worked in the coal mines of northeast pennsylvania and would come after 12 hours and play football for four hours its because they didnt have a platform on which to stand

8340119 some weekends i feel like we have a dominant car and other weekends i feel like were a fifth place car or even a 10th place car johnson said
8340120 with the strong team we have we seem to be able to rally back and get finishes out of it so i still think that we are maybe behind
8340121 in different weeks the 88 car earnhardt has been the car the 24 gordon was the car early we were and its just tough to really say where were at johnson said
8340122 its been tough for him and its been a huge huge challenge for him johnson said
8340123 but more importantly the go to moves that weve always had with the old car do not work with the cot and to kind of retrain chads brain and look at things in a different way that is the hardest part for him
8340124 the latest greatest moves and the stuff we thought was going to work based on the old car and we were not even in the same race he said
8340125 we were out there in a seven cylinder class it seemed like that has been the hardest part to find out where to work and thats what weve done all season long
8340126 there is not anyone smarter than chad but the way he has thought about setting these cars up and what we have done in the past doesnt work with this new car he said
8340127 we are trying to find the right direction in the right areas to turn him loose and let him work
8340128 close to getting it right he knows there isnt some magic button knaus will find that will put johnson back at the front of the pack
8340129 its a lot of small areas and we are now i feel getting the rhythm of this car and understanding what to work on
8340130 just good racing and doesnt think either driver will let the rivalry take his focus off the championship if anything its just another reason to stoke the competitive fire
8340131 as the chase gets closer everybody that has a shot at this thing is going to find ways to motivate themselves and areas they can potentially play mind games in or be out on the track and try to intimidate someone he said
8340132 i feel like we are one of the guys to be considered a favorite in the championship and look forward to getting started he said
8340133 in my books ive described pattern recognition as fundamental to trading with patterns learned through a process of implicit learning implicit learning occurs when we are exposed to multiple examples of patterns and thus become sensitive to the rules or regularities behind those patterns this process is implicit in that it occurs without conscious calculation for example young children can speak in grammatical constructions having heard so many sentence patterns over time but they cannot verbalize the rules of proper grammar similarly we know how to act and react in social situations having experienced them so often but could never formulate enough rules to capture our sensitivities to other people rather bad trading begins with attachments to ones ideas to trading results to reputation or to just being right once we are attached to what markets can bring us were no longer receptive to what we know implicitly this is where much self help coaching advice about trading has it all wrong its not about thinking more positively about yourself its about removing the self from pure performance skill we cannot access what we know implicitly when we are locked into mindless patterns of explicit thought to stay unattached to the outcomes of our actions when we are surrounded by vast risk and reward this is why trading is such a vexing and noble challenge
8340134 think about reading a market like reading a person youll listen for the communications of the market what its doing but also for the metacommunications how its expressing itself lets take yesterdays market as an example
8340135 provide an anchor of objectivity in an investment world populated by those more interested in rewards than in uncovering systemic risks

8340137 theres always a bull market somewhere and we promise our swimwear will make you forget about it
8340138 yes its the end of the summer but the fed boys worked over the weekend so whats the excuse of hank paulson amp co the saber rattling for the fannie and freddie rescue program to be unveiled is getting louder and louder
8340139 if the u s government allows fannie and freddie to fail and international investors are not compensated adequately the consequences will be catastrophic
8340140 if it is not the end of the world it is the end of the current international financial system
8340141 as the only semi positive note ive seen in weeks i think it should generate some interest if not from longs then from shorts but any price action to the upside will prob be limited

8340143 we are seeking a declaration that klausners visual voicemail patent is invalid and that verizons system does not infringe the patent in any event
8340144 we mostly played on the computer and read a little
8340145 earlier this week we released a beta of the android sdk
8340146 in the accompanying post i mentioned that we had to remove some apis from the platform for android 1 0 and as a result they dont appear in the 0 9 beta sdk and wont appear in 1 0 compatible sdks
8340147 at first remote applications could send arbitrary intents meaning that your google talk friends had almost the same control of your device as you did
8340148 even once that issue was resolved we recognized that we could not trust the identity of the application who sent the request
8340149 an android application using gtalkservice would be reachable from all of the users google talk friends and a flaw in that application could pose an inviting target to a malicious friend or automated malware
8340150 the reason is that we plain ran out of time
8340151 the android bluetooth api was pretty far along but needs some clean up before we can commit to it for the sdk keep in mind that putting it in the 1 0 sdk would have locked us into that api for years to come
8340152 the tour travels for four months and is for military families only

8340154 i am the least hardest working person here i only drive the bus but help out when i can
8340155 i have been with the touring company since 1996 performing has always been a part of my life but it is the look on the childrens faces that energizes me
8340156 i kind of wanted to come and i kind of didnt
8340157 the first one was definitely unexpected and a bit of shock dixon said last weekend at infineon raceway
8340158 in 03 i think it all came a bit too soon when we came out of the end of the year and we had won a championship i dont think we knew what wed actually achieved and now knowing what goes into it and the rewards that go to the guys and everybody who helps thats the biggest part of it
8340159 if we do win a championship it would mean a ton more than 03 i think
8340160 the drought seasons in 04 and 05 definitely make you respect things a lot more feel gifted in that you have the opportunity dixon said
8340161 so anytime you even win a race you thrive on it a little more
8340162 i think you definitely get recognized a lot more especially in indy which is where i live he said
8340163 theres such a history there and people love that race and i probably get a little more respect too
8340164 i think if helio wins the next two races we just have to place fourth so we should be able to do that ganassi said
8340165 we just have to stay behind him were ok we have a long way to go yet
8340166 it was definitely a bad day dixon said after the race
8340167 i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
8340168 we just need to keep doing what weve been doing all year and well be fine
8340169 in terms of this season i think everything that hes done and weve had success together in the past is the result of all of those years of working hard day by day hull said
8340170 its not something that just fell into place its his experience level all the things that hes managed to gather up in his data bank of experience is paying large dividends
8340171 with his ability to adapt his driving style to the racetracks that we have today in this series hes at the right place at the right time with the right team
8340172 its the same people and theyre obviously doing the same things that they were and maybe its a combination of all the small things have probably come through a little better he said
8340173 last year we were decent i think we just werent aggressive enough in the first part of the season and thats where we lost a lot of it and had to try and pull it back with six races to go
8340174 banks lose but you could win on fannie and freddie preferreds
8340175 a number of traders have commented to me on how choppy the market conditions have become a strong movement seems under way and then it just as strongly reverses
8340176 the risk of tweaking formulas too much is that slowly and almost imperceptibly you gradually alter the taste so that after five alterations you have something that tastes different than it did five years ago
8340177 lets not get all hung up on legal issues lets think about the broader economic and social issues and take a pragmatic approach
8340178 this is a day to celebrate his life and his passing on to a better place not to mourn

8340218 wenn jemand noch ber die motive russlands bei der entfachung eines kriegs gegen georgien ger tselt hat sind diese zweifel nun zerstreut moskau hatte seine entscheidung von anfang an getroffen
8340219 europa und seine verb ndeten sind verpflichtet die integrit t georgiens zu verteidigen
8340220 zu wenig zu leise mit allzu viel verst ndnis und entschuldigend so lassen sich die reaktionen auf russlands angriff gegen georgien zusammenfassen jetzt bedarf es einer wesentlich sch rferen politik um der russischen herausforderung zu begegnen
8340221 the sport has a pace where you have to be very sensitive if this works well and it will work well i think this will help the sport help us get it right in an area that has become increasingly difficult
8340222 i dont plan on giving any home runs up on thursday so it shouldnt really bother me
8340223 as long as we can keep throwing baseballs while theyre doing the reviews that delay wont be a problem but i hope im not the first one who has to do it
8340224 i dont know if its necessary or not but i know its going to be fair to both teams you dont want home runs taken away from you
8340225 if its more than a handful of times ill be surprised its such a tough call in some other ballparks i really think they need help on those calls theres still going to be human error but with our technology theyre going to get it right
8340226 im more old school im a guy who likes the human decision of the umpire right call or wrong call
8340227 a guy might be safe and hes called out and everyone jumps up and down the fans go crazy thats kind of cool
8340228 there are a lot of bad calls you just get through it where will this end and this system isnt going to be perfect either theyre not going to catch everything
8340229 i think its really great every other sport has it why not baseball
8340230 if you have the technology why not use it everyones happier if the call is right
8340231 they can do balls and strikes that would be fine with me
8340232 i dont want to make any predictions that ill be sorry about but there are some people who believe if we handle it right it could actually be efficient in shortening the game a little bit
8340233 we just believe that young girls today are bombarded with so much inaccurate advice on how to build their self esteem messages that focus on the outside rather than whats within we want to change that message
8340234 oh well my next salary is going to cover it anyways whats the point of taking a picture and posting it on supermarket

8340243 were always looking to freshen things up to create new excitement
8340244 with coors having the pole winner that obviously created a faster dialogue about how to address it this was we think a very exciting solution and gives us the continuation of a 30 plus year heritage with the budweiser shootout

8340252 i saw that i was going to win and i celebrated because i worked hard all year and i got what i wanted
8340253 i havent set any goals for the rest of the season

8340292 at the recommendation of uh athletic trainers rausch yesterday was limited during throwing drills alexander a fourth year junior from santa rosa college took 14 of the 18 snaps in team drills rausch had four snaps
8340293 alexander made the most of his opportunity completing 11 of 12 passes he scrambled once and was sacked once
8340294 when we were making the first evaluation two weeks ago greg got hurt he hurt his feet and stuff you try and get as much evaluation as you can and then when another guy goes down for a couple of days then you get to evaluate more of the other guy and maybe the second guy has really come along and healed up theyre both getting enough reps theyve got the same amount of reps all camp both of them are ready to play at game time im going to go with the guy that we have the best chance to win with
8340295 i wasnt 100 percent when i had those foot problems im not going to make excuses i didnt go out and perform i have to show now that i can play im going to keep trying to work harder to get better i think ive been doing that well see what happens on game day
8340296 its always been a competition it always will be until somebody really steps up
8340297 tyler is going to get his chance he deserves one well see how it goes
8340298 i can only control what i do and the coaches are going to make their decision so thats how i have to approach it
8340299 we didnt give rausch a lot of big throws yesterday you just dont want to go out and start throwing deep balls and making tough throws because it affects your mechanics and that could lead to more injuries and more soreness we gave him some of the mid level lower level throws
8340300 ive still got a ways to go but watching the films i can see some progress coming the more reps youre able to take the more you can get into a rhythm and get a feel for things its like anything else the more you do it the better youre going to get at it
8340301 were going to make that decision and the next guy could be one play away from getting in the ballgame the first guy that goes in is going to be the quarterback and i dont want him looking behind his back but they could both play all three of them could play
8340302 i like the fact that he played for us last year i like the fact that when were in meetings hes taking notes i like the fact that hes always watching films and taking notes and studying i think hes really focused on this his senior year and being a complete player
8340303 were going to get reps from laeli i dont know how many reps laeli will get hell play probably 20 snaps
8340304 if coach said 20 im going for 30 its an important game
8340305 they need to be with their kids in the morning or at night
8340306 the most important thing is your family i have my personal family my wife my daughter and my grandkids but i also have this family my team my players my coaches thats my family too if you have your family you have everything
8340307 its stressing me out trying to get tickets for everybody
8340308 after two days of practice in atlanta lane and running back khevin peoples will be traveling back to their home state for the warriors game against the fifth ranked gators at the swamp
8340309 its going to be a good experience im excited to just go back and see my family ive been looking forward to this one since i found out it was on the schedule now its right around the corner
8340310 yeah i guess its a homecoming but its not a vacation im not going there to hug my cousins or get money from my grandpa it doesnt matter whos there its still a business trip
8340311 safety spencer smith will actually have the warriors first homecoming as the team stops in atlanta on its way to florida smith is from marietta ga
8340312 it means a lot i didnt know if i was going to be going
8340313 this isnt charity for him hes a good player and hes coming up there to help us i look at jake kind of like my graduate assistant he has a nice calming effect he knows when to speak up and hes just such a good role model the effort he puts in knowing he probably wont get a chance to play is a tribute to his character and hes going to be successful in life
8340314 im glad theyre going to get to see me and it shows if you put your time into it and be patient good things are probably going to come
8340315 we are taking them very seriously they are a good team when they come to the swamp they are going to be very motivated theyll play with a lot of passion
8340316 it makes me feel really good as parents we feel blessed and know we kept god at the center of our lives and when we see them interact and how they get along well with others we feel so blessed
8340317 love being the no 1 thing with anything that happens forgiveness and being disciplined being true to your word whatever you say and you speak you follow your word and we laugh whenever we can
8340318 alvis and lee ann satele both had outstanding athletic careers at uh alvis in football and lee ann in volleyball
8340319 they didnt really tell me anything about their athletic history at uh until i was in high school i think ninth grade
8340320 those genes produced four division i children liko and brashton playing football at uh chanteal playing volleyball at saint marys in california and a j playing baseball at uh hilo when it still was a division i sport
8340321 my mom used to wait up for me she was on the couch waiting for me calling me at 10 oclock asking me where i am
8340322 this is the first time im on brashtons team i have a front row seat to watch my brother if i need anything i just ask him
8340323 they all talk frequently alvis and lee ann even learned how to send text messages to communicate with their children sending
8340324 we were involved and we made sure that every part of their lives was covered
8340325 family is more important than sports i always taught the kids to be close to each other
8340326 it was very important we wanted them to do it for fitness but we realize what they can learn from sports and playing team sports
8340327 the children take pride in the family name and not only because of what their parents did on the field or the court but how they produced off of them as well raising them to be fine individuals
8340328 it made me think twice about what we did because everything came back to our parents
8340329 shes the only woman ive ever loved no doubt about that
8340330 theirs is truly a love story sweethearts since high school when he was a senior and she was a sophomore they have never had an argument
8340331 its because we have mutual respect for each other and of course love
8340332 there have been jobs that were better professionally every decision we make together shes the best coachs wife theres a lot of pressure to win and be successful i remember heathers mom 14 years after we were married wondering if i was going to get a real job they dont understand heather knows how tough it is
8340333 its the tough town in that area you usually have something to do with green chains and lumber and hard work its a hard working family town where people have a lot of respect for each other
8340334 if we wanted to participate in after school activities we had to earn the money
8340335 heather like most kids in the area worked in the green bean fields during the summer she would ride her bike there early then pick furiously until about noon the beans would be put into big sacks then taken to the end of the road where they would be weighed each worker would receive a ticket that could be redeemed for cash the goal was 300 pounds at five cents a pound that helped pay for activities and clothes
8340336 the big goal was to have enough clothes to not repeat an outfit during the week it was easy to keep your room clean because we didnt have many things
8340337 greg also worked when he wasnt playing sports he inherited the relentless gene from his father who worked two jobs when greg was in the seventh grade his father lost two fingers in a mill accident his recovery was during the holiday season
8340338 we had a walnut tree out in the back yard to have christmas we cracked the walnuts that were in our back yard and took them to a walnut factory we sold them for money to go get presents for the family it was always creative
8340339 the mcmackins introduction also was unique the seating chart in math class was in alphabetical order heather forge was in the front row some of gregs football teammate were in the back
8340340 i was a quintessentially painfully shy person he was mr everything
8340341 i was humiliated i thought all of the cool guys were making fun of me
8340342 when greg found out he approached her offering an apology he then asked her out
8340343 we started dating february of my sophomore year i never dated anyone else
8340344 its not like today when you could text each other we sacrificed and earned the right to be together
8340345 but we got married the spring term of my senior year of college weve been together all of our life and sort of raised each other
8340346 a hotel was a big deal to us in those days that was living there was a swimming pool
8340347 gregs next job led to a move into an apartment in a complex known as silver bell foothill estates
8340348 weve always traveled like the mack pack ive always tried to be there for my daughter and my grandkids my family is the most important thing in both of our lives thats why were all here because of how our family feels
8340349 heather who successfully hosted a football clinic for women last week hopes to resume her volunteer work she helped coordinate a program aimed at vision testing for children many serious vision problems are correctable if detected before the age of 6
8340350 coming from oregon true oregonians are very similar to the people of hawaii
8340351 families are really important to them theyre brought up with respect god and theyre hard working people family people thats why i like it so much here honestly to be here is a blessing heather and i have worked hard and were fortunate to live in the greatest place
8340352 today more than ever we must do everything we can to support our employees who are also serving our nation through the guard and reserve
8340353 it is incumbent on every employer to give all the support possible to these brave servicemen and women
8340354 thats why i have reached out to my fellow mayors and asked them to join me in signing an employer support of the guard and reserve statement of support
8340355 when mayors sign a statement of support they recognize national guard and reserve as essential to the strength of our nation and the well being of their communities
8340356 mayor begich realizes the integral role the guard and reserve plays in our nations defense that has never been clearer than during the current global conflicts
8340357 these servicemen and women cannot effectively carry out their military role if theyre worried that they will lose their civilian job as a result of their service
8340358 the loss of a valued employee is always a concern even on a temporary basis
8340359 overall the impact has been minimal but the mayor is committed to doing whatever we have to during this difficult time
8340360 the courage it took for him and the it took for him to stand up in front of his organization and say this is the right thing to do really makes that guy twice the patriot in my view
8340361 as much as it seems like a challenge to some of us who are outside of governance i think the positive response should be overwhelming
8340362 this is the right thing to do and its the right time to do it
8340363 today supportive employers are critical to maintaining the strength and readiness of the nations national guard and reserve units
8340364 its an unfortunate sign that climate change is coming rapidly to the arctic and that we really need to address the issue of global warming on a national level
8340365 full throated defense not just of his candidacy or of the vague ideas of change and progress but of progressivism as an ideology
8340366 with minayas five year 4 million contract set to expire after 2009 its a safe bet that he will be signed to an extension at the end of this season and why not
8340367 i blame schneider for last nights loss that throw was right at him on one hop we didnt get him for his bat he is supposed to be this great defensive catcher
8340368 its very likely tony bernazard would replace him which i doubt anyone wants
8340369 36 year old manny 22 million a year please shoot me now
8340370 ranked good health harmonious family life and good relationships with their wife or partner as more important to their quality of life than material self fulfilling or purely sexual concerns

8340379 the change i feel is fans are really supporting me and telling me im still no 1 and still the best
8340380 i never saw my opponent before that was the tricky part
8340381 i thought the other guy played good for the pressure he was under
8340382 i went on a great roll the only thing i look back on that was a little bit unfortunate was that i was not able to stay ahead with the break in the third set

8340388 i plead with you brethren by the name of our lord jesus christ that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you
8340389 i declare to you the gospel which i preached to you which you also received and in which you stand by which also you are saved if you hold fast that word which i preached to you unless you believed in vain for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures
8340390 if you hold fast that word which i preached to you
8340391 if you keep in memory that word which i preached to you
8340392 that each of you says i am of paul or i am of apollos or i am of cephas or i am of christ
8340393 i am of john wesley or i am of john calvin or i am of joseph smith
8340394 in vain they worship me teaching as doctrines the commandments of men
8340395 the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but to us who are being saved it is the power of god
8340396 do not come near me for i am holier than you
8340397 come now and let us reason together says the lord
8340398 if you refuse and rebel you shall be devoured by the sword for the mouth of the lord has spoken
8340399 if anyone is in christ he is a new creation old things have passed away behold all things have become new
8340400 well keep doing it until we find the right way

8340412 ok so maybe getting a gig of the best of drone wasnt the best idea
8340413 are you sitting farther away from the computer screen than you used to
8340414 we are working to create an organization that can best adapt itself to working with the interagency with our international partners and even with the private public sector
8340415 and we want to do it in a way that is completely supportive of all our partners
8340416 if i would put one word on it its partnership
8340417 that is our southcom motto partnership for the americas and our objective is to become the best possible international interagency partner we can be
8340418 i think you in many ways represent the face of the future with respect to our combatant commands
8340419 you may be leading what we are doing in our government
8340420 the united states needs organizing structures that are custom made for the age we live in not where we have come from
8340421 we in the federal government need to be organized so we can build and put together solutions to 21st century security challenges because they are not the same challenges we had in the 20th century
8340422 previous southcom commanders have recognized we need to fundamentally change how we do business around here
8340423 our philosophy from the beginning was to say this is about rethinking southcom and rethinking what a combatant command is
8340424 so we are first cousins with africom no doubt about it
8340425 the end state we and africom are aiming for is really the same end state philosophically
8340426 our staffs are talking constantly and we are indeed sharing lessons back and forth
8340427 we are trying to do some very similar things and it all goes back to partnership
8340428 we have the same end state but our paths to get there are very different
8340429 africom was a top down initiative that started with a presidential directive ours was a grassroots bottom up effort it started down here where we did some things internally studied it then ultimately the commander took it forward
8340430 africom has an initiation challenge and we have a transformation challenge
8340431 i wont say that one is easier or harder than the other they are just different
8340432 you need to have all these folks working together and cooperating you have to build a coalition of the willing
8340433 and thats the way they work today it is truly remarkable
8340434 our focus has broadened to maintaining security building and increasing stability and setting the conditions for prosperity in the region
8340435 were in the refinement phase right now and will call our provisional reorganization complete by the end of the fiscal year
8340436 yes we believe the new structures will better enable us to work together in new ways to address the security challenges we have
8340437 my job is to try to build an organization that is appropriate for the world to the south
8340438 i think we have done that and i think we will continue to work very hard doing that and ill let others draw appropriate lessons
8340439 we are working very hard to make sure we answer everyones questions and do everything within the boundaries of policy and law and do it with full transparency
8340440 the bottom line is that what we are doing here makes sense
8340441 we want to be a shaper of ideas helping build partnerships between actors that dont traditionally work together all focused on a common purpose
8340442 thats what will give us the ability to develop security solutions that will be effective in our new contemporary operating environment
8340443 this isnt an original game its cod4 with space marines

8340537 we are extremely proud of the accomplishments we have made in security on the ground as well as proud of all of our great warriors for the work they are doing since they arrived in theater
8340538 we recognize the sacrifices they make and the sacrifices their families and communities make as they serve in iraq
8340539 the most austere conditions meaning they are in patrol bases and combat outposts
8340540 they are doing what they joined the military to do
8340541 if they joined to be a rifleman theyre doing it in combat

8340549 third party publishers are looking at the same things we are and they want to put games into as many peoples hands as possible
8340550 the lack of a dominant console means its too difficult for software makers to give up on a console
8340551 with the ps3 or xbox 360 you dont have a clear winner like the playstation 2 or playstation were
8340552 the reality of exclusives is that they will become far more infrequent the way hardware companies have to offset that is through enhancing the quality of games coming through their own studios that will drive customers to buy their own hardware system
8340553 people were buying the xbox in anticipation of halo 3

8340607 purpose grown energy forests if planted today could meet all of new zealands future road transport fuel and industrial heat energy needs without threatening the countrys important agricultural industries
8340608 low input forestry provides a much more sustainable base from which to produce transport biofuels than intensive agriculture

8340619 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8340620 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8340621 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8340622 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8340623 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8340652 es destacable pero no sorprendente que un n mero de agencias comunitarias y la ce hayan tratado de culpar a ryanair de bloquear las actividades ilegales de estas agencias en vez de abordar el verdadero esc ndalo que esconde aumentos de precio del 200 y el 300 que han sido cargados a unos consumidores inocentes

8340660 es normal que se quejen es su papel cuando aparece una epidemia tienen que ser las autoridades quienes la solucionen y quienes hagan un mayor esfuerzo y ah s que veo que las autoridades s lo han hecho un esfuerzo relativo y lo tendr n que redoblar porque los ganaderos por s s los no lo podr n hacer

8341014 what i think is potentially problematic is if more top authors start withdrawing from the peer reviewed journals then the peer reviewed journals become a less impressive signal of the quality of the paper
8341015 is you get to a point where you cant make a reputation for yourself by publishing in the peer reviewed journals that locks in todays elite
8341016 the other thing thats a bit puzzling in this whole theory it seems to me is that with this explosion of information on the internet peer review has become even more needed because there are so many more papers

8341060 his supporters know that about him and are attracted to it so we cant apply the same rules to him
8341061 and i wanted to speak at the convention but before doing that you had to pledge your fealty your loyalty to the winner i didnt feel like doing that so the only way i got to speak was to second my own nomination its kind of a pathetic way of doing things but i did make the talk
8341062 its unfortunate that the great political conventions they used to debate the issues are now nothing more than backdrops
8341063 theyre a form of political advertising with all the serious issues handled backstage in a room with media advisers and not the hurly burly of constituents of all the diversity of america showing up at a raucous convention

8341073 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
8341074 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
8341075 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
8341076 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
8341077 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable

8341085 what exactly does a brand manager do i asked people who carry this title but i could never quite figure out which responsibilities this most ominous job entails besides creating hefty brand books with arcane brand architectures and guidelines usually ignored by employees and vendors auditing brand equity through some arbitrary tracking mechanisms and chasing malicious brand violators all over the globe
8341086 brand designers on the other hand are on the surge especially in the digital space their task is not to manage a brand but to creatively co shape its appearance on the web such that it becomes a viral conversation increasingly brands are built and destroyed on blogs and web sites so that there is a strong need for experts who understand brand in the context of online interaction paradigms digital branding experts know that nowadays brand architecture is largely congruent with the information architecture on the corporate web site and brand identity is made of the content that is disseminated to online audiences through search results online ads blogs campaigns and micro sites at last brand designers dispel separations that have been artificial anyway establishing a brand new equation brand experience is user experience is user interface design digital branding is branding and your web strategy is your brand strategy and vice versa
8341087 brand user experience design product design marketing communications pr online advertising etc what were seeing is an increased convergence of all these creative disciplines it is not a matter of strategic choice more a necessity the truth is that todays consumers demand that all these disciplines converge as their experience of a brand spans different platforms media and technologies ranging from the tv ad blog review the retail purchase the out of the box experience to online customer support the creative disciplines must too
8341088 a seamless convergent consumer experience requires seamless creative convergence which means that there is not much tolerance anymore for agency to agency hand offs in between

8341148 in 2003 when equality forum began contacting the fortune 500 companies 323 64 6 companies explicitly provided sexual orientation protection in their workplace policies
8341149 equality forum reached out to the ceos human resource directors and all members of the boards of directors of the 177 35 4 companies without this protection
8341150 the fortune 500 have overwhelmingly decided that including sexual orientation is in the best corporate interest and helps communicate corporate values to the estimated 660 billion 360bn annual domestic glbt consumer market
8341151 when it comes to equality texas is a lone and tarnished star
8341152 when 94 of the fortune 500 companies and 89 of the public support workplace equality congress is derelict by its failure to include glbt citizens in federal workplace discrimination protection

8341158 los estados tienen que resguardar el recurso y deben garantizar su acceso a todos los ciudadanos
8341159 alcanzar antes del tiempo previsto antes del tiempo previsto esta meta del milenio
8341160 por eso se ha incluido la iniciativa de llevar agua potable a todos los hogares venezolanos para el a o 2010

8341162 en el tema de la agricultura ecol gica no se est haciendo bien desde el gobierno central y mucho menos desde el gobierno de arag n ese terreno se ha abandonado y ha habido declaraciones bastante desafortunadas por parte del presidente del gobierno aragon s que han despreciado a los ecologistas y no han hecho m s que socavar la proyecci n que tiene la agricultura ecol gica como una v a de futuro de sostener la poblaci n en las zona rurales
8341163 es patente el fracaso a nivel del consumo que se est provocando aqu en la comunidad por la falta de inter s de las administraciones porque sin embargo en los particulares hay gente que se ha tirado a la piscina a producir en este terreno y est saliendo adelante
8341164 el escaso grado de conocimiento que tienen los consumidores de los alimentos ecol gicos y sus caracter sticas diferenciales es el principal freno del desarrollo de la demanda interna

8341172 las ayudas siguen siendo deficientes y m s en el caso de la ganader a ecol gica que pr cticamente no existe en arag n porque no tiene alicientes no hay ayudas y entonces la gente no se apunta
8341173 nos da miedo que siga esta din mica porque estamos orgullosos de que en arag n haya una cantidad importante de hect reas de este tipo de agricultura y ser a una pena que la gente no vea el aliciente necesario y se cambie a otra cosa que es lo que est pasando

8341202 while we are democrats and republicans in our hearts we are all idahoans
8341203 one of the hardest things weve had to do here is taking off our party hats
8341204 this is outrageous the people of idaho are entitled to have their representatives base their votes on the merits of a bill not on who backed the loser in a speakers contest
8341205 there was one of those six projects that was removed altogether why because the senator and the representatives from that district were from the wrong political party we need to take a step back

8341317 when i asked they said thered been a bit of damage done at the house and they needed to contact them the officers seemed quite jolly and upbeat but at the same time i was uneasy it was in the back of my mind all day and i kept trying jills number

8341345 entienden ahora porque en el pasado d a 1 de agosto nadie quiso dar esos datos p blicamente
8341346 no tiene sitio en partidos democr ticos donde las diferencias se tienen que dirimir de manera interna y debatiendo los temas querer purgar a toda la militancia de chiclana indica varias cosas que no se acepta la democracia interna las normas y sobre todo que no se respeta los derechos que asisten a cualquier ciudadano para seguir siendo militante de izquierda unida
8341347 por si se trata de alg n fallo burocr tico o de gesti n por parte de la organizaci n a nivel provincial y andaluz
8341348 este tipo de comportamientos le hagan ning n favor a la formaci n ni mucho menos a la vida democr tica

8341352 its a huge issue its at least as big an issue as the dns issue if not bigger
8341353 i went around screaming my head about this about ten or twelve years ago we described this to intelligence agencies and to the national security council in detail
8341354 tax breaks for health care expenses shouldnt be limited to those who have the means to fund an hsa
8341355 little about the political and economic obstacles that must be overcome to achieve it
8341356 care in massachusetts is extremely expensive thanks to supply side factors which means expanding and sustaining full coverage is fiscally speaking a tough proposition
8341357 individuals who have emergencies will receive even worse care than before
8341358 the speakers were not completely optimistic about comprehensive reform coming forth from washington but they did recognize that 2009 might still be a catalyst for positive change
8341359 cannot begin to compensate for the persistent deterioration in coverage that continues to plague us
8341360 public policy ought not be aimed at depressing demand for health

8341362 from the ergonomic body with the luxury of lots of buttons to the long zoom with great macro performance to its extended dynamic range and high iso shooting the s100fs was a greater and greater pleasure the more i used it
8341363 while it may not be perfect there is little not to like about this camera other than the use of a small viewfinder and the use a lithium ion battery the dilemma with this model is that its size weight and price makes it comparable to a dslr some people even mistake it for a dslr
8341364 the fuji finepix s100fs is an impressive camera though its price makes it a tough call it costs twice as much as other super zoom cameras and more than some entry level d slrs though to be fair adding a comparable lens pushes the price of an slr to over 1000
8341365 coming from a dslr background we are quite critical here on the other side this camera features an amazing zoom range without switching lenses if you learn to handle the ca and can live with the very slow xd write speed the s100fs can be a nice travel camera with a strong reach in the tele range
8341366 the fujifilm finepix s100fs has so many different features available it was difficult to know where to start
8341367 the finepix s100fs has just been named as the best superzoom digital camera for 2008 by the european technical image press association tipa we are also nominating it as an editors choice for the advanced category of compact digicams although with some reservations our main concerns lie with the high lateral chromatic aberration we found with the test cameras lens however the sporadic failures of the autofocusing system and poor quality of images shot at the top iso sensitivity are also of concern as is the lack of any ability to switch noise reduction processing off and on if these issues are of little or no relevance the s100fs will be an excellent and rewarding camera choice
8341368 at least as far as im concerned this is my 4th full size digital camera and the best by far even over my fuji s9000
8341369 at least as far as im concerned this is my 4th full size digital camera and the best by far even over my fuji s9000
8341370 i absolutely love this camera it is bigger than the fuji s9100 i had i love every feature about it it takes awesome pictures i cant wait to use it more
8341371 the flash is stronger than i was led to believe by some digital camera review sites the ability to use sd cards is a great relief since its suddenly become difficult to find high speed xd cards where i live
8341372 after doing a lot of research i ended up with the s100fs i can highly recommend this camera if youre like me in need of a good camera but you just do not want to deal with the limitations of a dslr
8341373 what can i do to pay for my blogs costs without pissing off my subscriber and reader base
8341374 youre going to be entering that cone of silence tomorrow
8341375 we believe that the unifying nature of the olympic games brings together people and communities in a way so as to enhance their lives

8341378 bringing these kids to beijing to witness the olympic games and the wonders of china is another example of our commitment to childrens well being
8341379 we all need to be prepared and ready to respond from the citizen level and at every level of government

8341441 he did it he tried to kill him he wasnt successful
8341442 there but for the grace of god is a murderer

8341446 these deceptive mailers purposely and unfairly targeted consumers who may have struggled at one time to manage their finances

8341452 if the government really wants a vibrant but disciplined real estate sector they should move to adopt a time befitting law through discussion with the stakeholders
8341453 the government should decentralise urbanisation and provide infrastructure so that there could be satellite townships at district level to reduce urbanisation pressure on the capital city
8341454 only one bail order is required for his release from jail
8341455 the process for the release of tarique rahman has made progress but it is not possible to say in detail about the moment

8341465 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8341466 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8341467 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8341468 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8341469 age and experience as a hindrance rather than a benefit
8341470 baby boomers always say that 40 is the new 30 and 50 is the new 40 in advertising 50 is the new 65 as soon as you hit that barrier youre considered old
8341471 its now starting at 40 or 45 unless youve gotten to a certain stage in your career where you have one of those bullet proof jobs where you are extremely key to a vulnerable
8341472 none of these factors reflect the merits of these older people unfortunately
8341473 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8341474 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8341475 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8341476 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8341477 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8341481 what every body is saying an ex fbi agents guide to speed reading people
8341482 we need non verbal cues to tell us what is important what is significant and what should we be looking for
8341483 what we wanted to see was a churchillian speech something that would move her candidate to cross that magic fence and she delivered a speech but the gestures the non verbals that give us the emotion really werent there
8341484 i think her message was supposed to be hey go with me and lets vote for barack there should have been a lot more emotive displays and we just simply did not see that
8341485 one of the things that you see is she has very limited hand gestures and we look for hand gestures to tell us whats important so when we see them out when we see them up this is significant and we saw them just a few times last night but not enough this was not an impassioned speech
8341486 when she was talking about things that were important to her i did notice non verbals like healthcare
8341487 when she was talking about mccain there was a lot of emphasis when she talked about her husband we saw more non verbals from the audience in regards to these issues than we saw from her
8341488 i noticed that she does something with her shoulders maybe thats how she emphasizes
8341489 one of the ways that we emphasize is by defying gravity
8341490 and our shoulders come up or we stand on our toes she does that a little bit but thats so weak that we tend to miss it
8341491 now toward the end of her speech we saw her hands come up and high and so forth this is where emotion was truly there
8341492 on when you see her i think a couple of times there when they were picturing her perhaps she was thinking this should be a little better and so forth but i think michelle was very receptive her non verbals actually were great at the beginning as she was you know you saw a lot of head tilt which is indicative of im receptive and so forth
8341493 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel

8341521 although we offer both fee based and percentage based pricing the overwhelming choice of our customers is fee based because our royalty services are automation based fees are quite low and theres no reason a label should give up a percentage of its revenue we had nothing to do with creating marketing or distributing the music why should we have any right to a portion of its revenue

8341580 at this point i cant say what we expect from this feature were just curious to see how it will be used
8341581 unfortunately because the examples he provides are still only experiments we cannot talk in length about how they work if we end up rolling out this experiment for all users we would definitely be able to talk in more detail right now we are experimenting with a number of factors so we cant really explain how the final product would work
8341582 we test almost everything even things that you would think are so small that we could not possibly care nor could they possibly matter in fact small changes do matter and we do care
8341583 some clinton supporters are trying to honor all the great work she did and all of her accomplishments

8341587 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8341588 if we dont have an official roll call vote state by state it is going to reopen a wound
8341589 i think in the end all democrats have to make a decision on what they want in the next four years
8341590 four more years of george bush or four more years of change
8341591 i do not want more four more years of bushs failed policies when it comes to this general election its time to do what hillary asked us to do last night
8341592 at the end it will be a unanimous decision to endorse obama
8341593 i believe obama and his wife are racist mccain looks presidential and is my choice

8341616 ha habido una oferta del real madrid por el jugador de m s de 40 millones de euros

8341621 defensor empat y sigue en la copa que venga river plate
8341622 poco m s de media hora le bast al equipo uruguayo para liquidar a libertad en asunci n y seguir so ando en la copa
8341623 lo mostrado por el equipo uruguayo en el primer tiempo permite ser optimista aunque deber tomar precauciones para no repetir los fallos que le permitieron al equipo paraguayo empatar el partido
8341624 el equipo uruguayo sali a atacar y no pudo ganar pero el libertad no puso en peligro su clasificaci n
8341625 como ya lo hab a hecho en 2007 el defensor elimin al libertad en un partido emotivo
8341626 los goles que logr en la primera parte le dieron la clasificaci n y ahora esperar a river plate un equipo con otras exigencias
8341627 como en la anterior edici n de la sudamericana defensor elimin de visitante con un empate a tres a libertad y ahora jugar en octavos de final frente a river plate que el a o pasado lo dej afuera en cuartos
8341628 fue un gran primer tiempo del equipo uruguayo que ciment la clasificaci n

8341651 tightening credit on the u s and european sides is starting to spill over into developing regions
8341652 american financial stocks are one example of that stocks were oversold for month upon month but it really doesnt seem to matter
8341653 notwithstanding that they know about previous tragedies these desperate people still try and make the journey to europe
8341654 the glimmer of hope here is that the industry as a whole is structurally profitable
8341655 investing in an email marketing program especially for the holiday season is a simple and effective way for retailers to grab a piece of the holiday spend that was a staggering 475 billion last year according to the national retail association
8341656 coupled with the direct marketing associations findings that email marketing in 2007 had an roi of more than 48 for every dollar spent marketers who initiate fine tune and enhance email marketing programs for the upcoming holiday season have a lot to gain
8341657 the best fans in the world are unusually quiet at the moment sensing a standard liege goal possibly
8341658 these belgians are nothing im loving all you doubting thomases have a little faith and youll see this will be our best season in years
8341659 so is rafa playing keane and gerrard behind torres or what also steaua are through finally some tradition returns to the european cup thats right the european cup
8341660 absolute rubbish from liverpool we dont deserve to be in the champions league i am afraid the chickens have come home to roost for benitez this isnt the beginning of the end its the middle of the end
8341661 am i right or wrong in thinking that the liverpool game goes straight to pens or is there extra time
8341662 whenever i watch van persie i always end up shaking my head saying
8341663 if they want to go on and score four or five they can
8341664 when oh when is rafa gonna ralise that dirk kuyt is not a right winger please rafa stop the pain
8341665 cant believe no one mentioned ricardo quaresma liverpool playing rubbish thank god for reina
8341666 anyway jonathan only kids should call you stevo your mum i am sure would prefer grownup women such as myself and grownup guys to call you jonathan so glad footie is back but after watching all those lovely euro games viva espana it all seems a bit slow however it is a beautiful game and so we live in hope
8341667 what was that awful cardigan mascherano had on straight from the alan partridge summer catalogue
8341668 sat at west ham wishing i was at home we look as if we should be in league two and they should be in the prem they want it and we dont shocking performance
8341669 liverpool are playing like an angry drunk that has been woken from a decent nap
8341670 could someone get down there and give denilson a good old fashioned slap for me if not ill go myself
8341671 why do we keep playing denilson he was awful against fulham and west brom my nan just rang she fancies herself to start against newcastle on saturday
8341672 lets see if rob n nando can destroy this lot tonight a 45m combo at home should really be doing the business
8341673 sat in a restaurant in lake garda with the missus hurrying her along so i can try and find a bar to watch the mighty reds trample over the belgians come on you reds
8341674 ugh this line up fills me with nothing but dread wouldnt be surprised if we didnt qualify should never have sold flamini
8341675 this liverpool line up has the last three performances written all over it
8341676 whats this champions league live on bbc tv have i misread
8341677 stevo you remind me alot of my former biology teacher who we also call stevo as his surname too was stevenson
8341678 stevo not everyone is saying mehmet aurelio ive said maynor figueroa twice but acknowledged that
8341679 is fabio aurelio the only player in world football with every vowel in his surname
8341680 am outside anfield and i can promise you it is rocking already going for a 4 0 win for the reds tonight with the anfield crowd making the difference
8341681 what if all the other social networks dedicated to books banded together and let their users communicate with each other over the fence as it were
8341682 these numbers are often fuzzy some deployments are classified others are temporary and just because the defense department claims 30 us troops in indonesia last year doesnt mean 1 500 didnt pass through on training missions even so the map and the associated research should give you a good feel for what the pentagon is up to around the world
8341683 do you feel you are properly compensated in your job
8341684 as important as salary may be professionals should keep in mind that a comprehensive employment package has a greater value than salary alone
8341685 professionals who are negotiating a job offer or salary increase should examine their options from all angles to ensure they are properly compensated
8341686 no only a ten ill be needing your phone number
8341687 market development of road construction machinery and trucks in russia

8341689 lost highway the groups 10th studio album which went to no
8341690 hey anytime evolution opens up a door like that to a band thats been around for as long as we have you have to go with it
8341691 i look up to see whos different here the latest me or the latest you i guess im pretty different now considering
8341692 love is all over the place theres nothing wrong with your face
8341693 i have no storage locker every single possession i own fits in one suitcase one carry on and theres my trumpet but i feel unbelievably lucky that i have an opportunity to be on the road 365 days a year
8341694 it really is a beautiful kind of love letter to italy expressing the longing of someone whos not there
8341695 italy has a romantic quality about it even for someone whos never been there the food the fashion the art the landscape the way the people live their life
8341696 to me music that breaks your heart is the music that stays with you forever
8341697 its one thing to be melancholy and one thing to be sophisticated but when you get the two of them together in a way people can relate to then i think youre on to something you want the sophistication to lie in the purity of the sound the beauty of the arrangements and the quality of the performances
8341698 ive already run out of space on my phone voicemail and notebooks and paper and everything so i just started writing all over my arms and hands and stuff
8341699 my arms are completely covered in notes and lyrics and stuff in these little pockets we have off of tour we write a lot ive got this dry erase board where i organize the ideas and fragments of songs and the progress of the entire body of work its getting out of control i think i need to get a second one
8341700 this is definitely going to be our coolest headlining tour ever
8341701 everybody on this package has a lot of cool stuff going on right now i just saw white tie affairs video on mtv their new single is totally blowing up innerpartysystem is totally blowing up right now too in a slightly different scene in a new york scene we were just in england again and they were all over the press there too every one of the support bands is kind of up and coming
8341702 its kind of a slightly tongue in cheek slightly ironic title right now though because things seem to be going so well
8341703 but truly we have learned that over the years regardless of radio and regardless of press and financial success our greatest equity is in our fanbase theyre the ones who buoy us and keep us alive we get so many letters and gestures from them it kind of refers to this entire fanbase around the globe if no one can afford therapy they can go to our shows
8341704 hope for the hopeless is also the title of an ep that the band self released to tide fans over between its 2006 atlantic records album
8341705 che il suo abbigliamento non era in linea con quanto prescrive il regolamento dei musei veneziani
8341706 bene ha fatto quel guardasala quando ha deciso di chiedere informazioni sul da farsi di fronte ad una donna invisibile
8341707 due eccessi contemporaneamente sono di troppo due veli contro la ragione sono per davvero inaccettabili
8341708 subito c chi parla di provvedimenti disciplinari contro colui che ha bloccato la signora in niqab islamico sottolinea il governatore pare anche che il direttore del museo abbia detto bastava un p di buon senso ma di che buon senso stiamo parlando quando si tratta di garantire sicurezza e dignit nel corso di una visita in un museo
8341709 in italia esistono leggi e circolari ministeriali che tra il 1975 e il 2000 hanno con spirito di tolleranza comunque normato una questione assai delicata ogni genere di copricapo va bene ogni genere di velo pu essere accettato purch lindumento mantenga il volto scoperto
8341710 sia chiaro simili usi e costumi non appartengono ai doveri imposti dalla religione islamica rientrano in alcune tradizioni
8341711 ormai da tempo si accede alle zone museali solo se ci si sottopone al metal detector
8341712 shes my old girlfriend i understand she took to drinking right after we split up those many years ago and i hear she hasnt been sober since

8341715 im sorry to bother you but im awfully cold and i was wondering if you could possibly pass me another blanket
8341716 thats right and thats the way its going to be until your damn attitude changes
8341717 so youre a man thats interesting im a woman wow just look at our cars theres nothing left but fortunately we are unhurt this must be a sign from god that we should meet and be friends and live together in peace the rest of our days

8341728 mr president ill be with you i want to remind you theres a reason why your father didnt go to baghdad
8341729 mr president the reason that he didnt go to baghdad is that he wasnt prepared to stay for five years
8341730 secondly mr president ill be with you on two conditions you guarantee me youre prepared to stay for five years and you publicly address the american people and tell them what this is going to take level with them
8341731 we went back to the record well give you a you got it in there an excerpt of the things i said contemporaneously like when the vice president was on russert saying theyve reconstituted their nuclear capability
8341732 joe you should weigh in and try to get the president to go to europe now now show solidarity now my word dont squander another opportunity now
8341733 mr president i think theres a need for a full blown doctrine of public diplomacy
8341734 hey this is soft shit what are we doing this for what are we doing this for
8341735 no youre busy we dont want to take your time we dont need to take your time its okay
8341736 the real question is why did we get off this way why did you sanction me in the first place
8341737 youve engaged in supporting terrorists matter of fact you blew up 35 of the kids who went to my alma mater along with another hundred or so people youre a terrorist thats why
8341738 nuclear weapons didnt help you very much in vietnam they didnt help you in iraq and if i ever used them youd blow me away
8341739 why should i be purer than they im getting penalized for this these buys are cutting their own deals
8341740 and they all ended up on the white house lawn
8341741 thats amazing that means your parliament can vote you out of office
8341742 we had a guy like that his name was george washington
8341743 we only kept him for eight years and got rid of him
8341744 unless you start squinting toward democracy i must tell you i for one am willing to take the pain of the oil shock of your cutting us off i will cut my deal with someone who is not a lot better but who can fill my needs in the near term mr unintelligible

8341748 what about the rivers in damascus arent those much cleaner
8341749 we simply cant drill our way to energy independence even if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards including the ones he cant even remember
8341750 the eucharist and the presence of the body and blood of christ is in my mind an overwhelming experience for me i find that communion for me is empowering its almost a feeling of a kind of high
8341751 could not have been better and made the case for change
8341752 peace is a key component of what im here to do
8341753 the overarching idea is that the world is safer if america has more friends more understanding more basis for communication
8341754 the world is safer if we in the united states congress can help diminish the level of desperation of the desperately poor the world is also safer if we can help strengthen democracies so that we dont have failed states
8341755 these guys are french citizens born in france raised in france but talked about how they were having difficulty integrating into french society
8341756 they were curious as to how it is that the american muslim community is so highly integrated and what they can do to facilitate that integration that we have here
8341757 in america you wear one if you want you dont wear one if you dont want
8341758 its left to the individual and it works out fine
8341759 in france we used to consider the american society as very segregationist
8341760 meeting congressman ellison was the first opportunity to change our opinion about america i was very surprised to see a muslim congressman in america which is viewed sometimes as an enemy of islam and muslims
8341761 his experience as muslim and black in the same time convinced me that it is possible in american to build your own dream even if you are a muslim
8341762 hes very effective and that helps us achieve the mission
8341763 they became friends and keith really extended himself by inviting them to join him in minneapolis
8341764 thats the kind of thing were hoping will come from this hdac effort were trying to do much more than congressional groups do when they visit countries
8341765 we had these immigrant communities from somalia ethiopia eritrea and kenya voice how they felt about u s policy toward the horn of africa
8341766 it was a tough meeting because everybody wanted to be heard you had people with long standing grievances really just wanting to be heard by people who represent them
8341767 my own sense is he wants to encourage the forces of moderation and dialogue in the world and works to find alternatives to confrontation
8341768 didnt you swear in on the quran i gotta get a picture of you
8341769 the only place i really hope to go is mecca
8341770 yes she was at her best tonight i supported her throughout but i wish she her husband and those who ran her campaign had handled things differently when they realized they had underestimated obama and his campaign
8341771 it ticked all the boxes in trying to rally support for obama and unify the democratic party and more important than anything else at least as far as hillary would be concerned it was good for her solidifying the fact that she still has quite a future in the higher echelons of power
8341772 hillary did wonderfully how many follow is probably a function of mccains selection
8341773 every time the camera panned to michelle obama you could see the dislike for hillary in her face she did a good job trying to mask it but it was very obvious to me
8341774 i loved michelle obamas speech it was nice to get to know more about her and im even more admiring now i like her husband but id vote for her if she was running
8341775 i did not watch it yet i am still not ready i was am a total hillary supporter my head can vote obama but then he says something to piss me off and i am writing in hillarys name again
8341776 as i was watching i was totally thinking why couldnt she be the one but i do encourage you to watch it when you are ready it may help a little with being able to vote for obama not much in still wishing that she was the one though
8341777 when gore kerry and now obama should have been reaching out to clinton and using his popularity to their advantage they didnt is it insecurity is it jealousy are they afraid he would take the limelight away from them
8341778 bill clinton appears to hold a grudge towards obama because hillary didnt win i think he has taken her loss personally to be honest i think bill hurt hillarys candidacy

8341808 other researchers have suggested in the past that nk cells might not always be good for you but we now have the first direct evidence that this can actually be the case although we have worked on an infectious disease the same is likely to be true for nk cells in cancer so in practical terms it means that we need to consider more carefully exactly how we use therapies that affect nk cells to maximize their beneficial role
8341809 this paper reports compelling evidence of paracrine signaling and the tumor growth inhibitory effects of hedgehog antagonists these data suggest that hedgehog antagonists may have therapeutic value not just in cancers driven by mutations in the hedgehog signaling pathway such as basal cell carcinomas bcc but also potentially in cancers where hedgehog signaling is driven by overexpression of the hedgehog protein
8341810 we are encouraged by our collaborator genentechs decision to conduct phase ii trials of gdc 0449 in colorectal and ovarian cancer in addition to a study in metastatic and locally advanced bcc we believe that the insights provided by these studies into the underlying mechanisms of hedgehogs involvement in cancer may lead to more effective treatment regimens using hedgehog antagonists such as gdc 0449

8341835 det var et benh rdt l b hvor der virkelig blev k rt st rkt hele dagen vi havde b de niki og nikola med fremme s vi fik d kket dagens vigtige udbrud af da nikolas gruppe blev indhentet med lidt over ti kilometer til m l var der flere ryttere som pr vede at k re kontra men niki sad helt forrest i feltet og holdt det samlet
8341836 med to kilometer til m l kom der en bakke p 500 meter p toppen af den havde to ryttere f et et lille forspring endnu engang satte niki sig forrest og brugte sine sidste kr fter p at hente dem det lykkedes med 500 meter til m l derefter ventede jeg lige et jeblik inden jeg startede min spurt med 300 meter til stregen desv rre viste den sig at v re lidt for lang for mig s jeg gik lidt kold til sidst fire mand gik forbi ind mod stregen s jeg endte p en femteplads hvilket vi godt kan v re tilfredse med efter et flot k rt l b af hele holdet
8341837 vi k rte et b de godt og skidt l b i starten var der en masse sm udbrud hvor vi var godt repr senteret hver gang p et tidspunkt k rte 12 ryttere dog af sted hvor vi ikke fik en rytter med det bet d at vi pludselig gik fra at v re i offensiven m tte overstille ogs til at k re defensivt og fors ge at k re udbryderne ind
8341838 vi holdte de 12 ryttere i kort snor hvor de hele tiden havde 2 minutter vi synes at vi havde tjek p det hele tiden da rytterne kom ind p de sm omgange som var meget kuperet var forspringet nede p 1 45 og frontgruppen blev stille og roligt reduceret da de forreste var tr tte michael reihs k rte p et tidspunkt op til de forreste som var nede p 9 ryttere og p dette tidspunkt s det s rdeles positiv ud da reihs er en hurtig afslutter og var den mest friske i gruppen desv rre blev det hele samlet igen med godt 10 kilometer til m lstregen
8341839 derefter var det andreas frischs tur til at angribe han kom af sted i en 6 mandsgruppe og de fik faktisk det hul som der skulle til men ak og ve s gik der total taktik i den og de kunne ikke blive enige derfor endte l bet noget overraskende i en massespurt som jeg faktisk ikke kan mindes er sket nogensinde f r vi dummede os engang i dag da vi ikke var med i 12 mandsgruppen ellers var det en flot dag fra drengene selvom det ikke blev til det store resultat

8342289 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state
8342290 announces the purpose for which the right was codified to prevent elimination of the militia
8342291 does not suggest that preserving the militia was the only reason americans valued the ancient right most undoubtedly thought it even more important for self defense and hunting

8342296 we have kept a close eye on the state of the economy and the impact it has continued to have on every person and every industry across the country

8342298 we have decided that it is our responsibility to suspend our construction activities at this time as we endeavor to preserve the continuing strength and vitality of our company
8342299 we look forward to resuming and completing construction of these two world class projects at the appropriate time
8342300 especially after their reaction to the court decision yesterday which was business as usual
8342301 perhaps this decision is the beginning of a discussion we can have with the senecas over the disposition of this lawsuit
8342302 we are continually managing our operations to mitigate these adverse developments
8342303 whatever we do in the future is gonna have to be fresh

8342312 i think its just a big anti incumbent movement throughout the country today starting at the federal level
8342313 ive been in office eight years and i have not changed my platform since i was first elected
8342314 when i was first elected i ran on creating quality jobs in santa rosa county improving quality of life protecting our military bases preserving lands throughout the county and ive done that i think people realized ive done what i said i was going to do since 2000 tonight they put me back in office because i did what i said i was going to do
8342315 i think people wanted change i did a lot of doorto door walking and there were lots of people that were anti incumbents and wanted change
8342316 they were not pleased with the way things were going even though i was a past commissioner i had a record of being conservative and more business minded and i think thats what they want
8342317 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8342318 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8342319 this is the first time in history that you have people who are working 40 hours a week and having trouble feeding their families and putting a roof over their head
8342320 the idea behind america is you work really hard and your work is rewarded
8342321 if you look at these numbers that is increasingly less true
8342322 this economic expansion was uniquely unrewarding for middle and low income households
8342323 these gains came too little too late in an economic recovery that yielded far too few gains for working families
8342324 the american work force is working harder and smarter baking the economic pie yet the size of their slices is thinning
8342325 americans are just having a much harder time maintaining the standard of living they had in the past
8342326 the country is moving toward a mass democracy more reflective of poor people rather than rich people
8342327 i truly thought in my heart of hearts i was doing the right thing
8342328 we got caught in the tornado when he slipped out of control
8342329 he never informed me he wasnt licensed he was telling me to get facials after the botched surgery i must have spent 800 on facials
8342330 hes suspended and hes breaking florida statute if he continues to practice
8342331 anybody can say what they want but there are two sides of every story
8342332 hes a talented well educated man who has now lost what he worked so hard for
8342333 hes now a four time convicted felon and going to prison
8342334 thou shall not boil a fucking steak so sayeth the lord
8342335 the gsa is trying to cancel their lease with us and we have filed a claim in the federal court of claims in washington d c
8342336 the large amount of parking required would be difficult if not impossible downtown
8342337 we definitely try to encourage the government buildings to locate in that area to make it easier for people to use those services
8342338 at one point it looked like we had lost it out of waterloo entirely
8342339 if youre looking at costs that our hospitals have to cover due to uncompensated care youre seeing rising numbers over the last several years
8342340 its a serious problem and can be a serious expense for the hospitals in western pennsylvania
8342341 were seeing more and more cases where the hospitals have to come up with money to cover the cost of caring for uninsured and underinsured patients
8342342 were still completing 2007 numbers but it looks like that trend will continue
8342343 this is probably the largest single site target for law enforcement
8342344 the investigation is ongoing and we will go where the evidence leads us
8342345 identity theft is a growing problem in the united states and the department of justice has prioritized bringing perpetrators of these crimes to justice and protecting the interests of innocent victims
8342346 yesterdays enforcement action is part of ices ongoing nationwide effort to shut down the employment magnet fueling illegal immigration
8342347 we are committed to strengthening the integrity of our nations immigration system
8342348 one the economy is starting to turn around and considering weve spent the last four years in an economic recovery youd think wed see an improvement
8342349 but were now four years into it and were seeing no change
8342350 id like to think its a wake up call for people in both the legislative and executive branches in connecticut we need to do more than just offer lip service
8342351 show that six years of economic growth did not lead to better times for the nations poor
8342352 millions more people today are out of work or facing shrinking earnings
8342353 if the poor saw no benefit over the course of the most recent recovery their situation is clearly worse today
8342354 todays news confirms what americas struggling families already know that over the past seven years our economy has moved backwards
8342355 this is the failed record of george bushs economic policies that sen
8342356 restrain out of control growth in health care costs that is putting coverage out of reach for too many americans
8342357 were heartened by the drop thats good company to be in
8342358 if you think the status quo is ok its not
8342359 there are still people who are behind the numbers and people who are suffering
8342360 we have not made progress in fixing connecticuts broken health care system
8342361 there needs to be an overall plan some type of consensus driven cohesive plan that addresses the majority of the issues
8342362 theres no easy answer in terms of getting all these people insured unless there are some major changes in the way we address these issues
8342363 children and families living in areas already experiencing relative deprivation therefore face further inequity because they have less access to high quality childcare provision
8342364 early years graduate leader training as we know that this is the best way to improve standards
8342365 i truly thought in my heart of hearts i was doing the right thing
8342366 we got caught in the tornado when he slipped out of control
8342367 he never informed me he wasnt licensed he was telling me to get facials after the botched surgery i must have spent 800 on facials
8342368 hes suspended and hes breaking florida statute if he continues to practice
8342369 anybody can say what they want but there are two sides of every story
8342370 hes a talented well educated man who has now lost what he worked so hard for
8342371 hes now a four time convicted felon and going to prison
8342372 in a frighteningly short period of time tratt street fell to its knees sacked by the conversion to student rental housing
8342373 garage doors were walled over added cars spilled over onto sidewalks and lawns while garbage cans spilled into poor tratt street
8342374 were overcrowded on campus as we prepare to build the new dorm
8342375 if you want a nice place to live for fair rates its where youve got to go
8342376 moving into a single family home thats well taken care of those are the homes that id personally like to live in
8342377 the professional landlords arent buying the single family homes that you can just put three people in
8342378 economically its not feasible with the mortgage insurance taxes and upkeep the people who are buying those are parents and that has added a new dimension to the whole thing
8342379 its totally against the law and it just kind of ruins the whole atmosphere of the single family home neighborhood
8342380 if you drive through town you can notice a college house even if its not supposed to be
8342381 some students are less considerate than others of the needs and wants of their neighbors
8342382 but the students lifestyle is not like that of a single family its a totally different lifestyle that doesnt always fit in well
8342383 if they fail to understand that the person next door has a 3 year old daughter whos sick and needs to sleep until they face that menacing neighbor next door theyll never understand
8342384 the city has to step in no matter what the cost to protect the people it made the laws for
8342385 we need to make sure that the homes close to campus are habitable
8342386 its just one of those sort of off the wall crazy things that is never really going to happen to me
8342387 its just another possibility along with being killed in a building by a plane
8342388 i didnt think i was invincible but i really didnt think it would happen to me
8342389 i dont think its too much to ask my player to accept the premise and situation of the story she is in and to behave in a reasonable manner
8342390 the problem as i see it is that the story itself is still widely considered to be a separate layer of the game from the game mechanics the end result is a severe disconnect between what npcs are saying to you and your behavior until such time as player actions all player actions are directly interpreted as components of the story its not going to be solved either

8342397 indeed it was where he met his wife tracy orillo on their first day of employment a picture of donovan in his football playing days he started on the offensive line for dick tomey hangs in son joshuas room part of the way he evaluates coaches is by whether hed feel comfortable if his own children played for them
8342398 representing uh and the state is a tremendous honor and thats something we should never lose sight of
8342399 it is a point he has pressed with not only uh staff but in addressing aloha stadium staff and to business and community groups
8342400 as an athletic department staff as coaches and as players we owe it to the fans and people of the state to put our best efforts forward

8342427 we took all the classic spider man villains and put them on a shelf for a few months now were dusting them off and bringing them out full force
8342428 we knew this story was going to start wave two of brand new day and editor steve wacker wanted a primer at the top of the book to bring everybody up to date
8342429 menace seems very intent on deciding whos going to be the next mayor of new york
8342430 weve seen menace be responsible for the death of one candidate and we saw the villain try to assassinate bill hollister as well
8342431 bill hollister is the crusading ex district attorney and the father of peter parkers friend lilly hollister the young hip partying socialite
8342432 hes also a surrogate father to another one of peters friends carlie cooper there have been hints that carlies father died years ago and she was raised by bill hollister so hes like a father to her to in addition to that lilly hollister is dating petes best friend harry osborn whos been very active in backing the hollister campaign
8342433 here menace launches an attack on a pro bill hollister truck but the end result of the fight peels back a scandal that hurts crowne
8342434 harry has got a lot of irons in the fire
8342435 hes got a hot girlfriend he used to be running oscorp and hes now running the coffee bean and if you read the issue you know his dad is coming to town
8342436 we will see some things about harry in new ways to die but when the solicitations for december come out one of the things youre going to see is that were really going to lift up the skirt and show you a lot about harry and where he was and what he was doing in between one more day and the start of
8342437 we always knew there was going to be warring papers slott said
8342438 in any election youll see different papers take different attitudes weve seen a lot of whats been going on at the db and the sinister dealings of dexter bennett and you need an opposition to that i knew from the minute i did the peter parker paparazzi story and robbie robertson quit the db that he was going to frontline
8342439 any character that attracts that much attention and even ire is always a fun a character to play around with youre going to see her butt heads with db crime reporter betty brant as kind of feuding reporters that will be fun
8342440 theyll have many ramifications in the world of amazing spider man
8342441 the t bolts youre meeting here are the t bolts for the story
8342442 and a lot of that is with the arrival of a new character next issue theres only so many people you can move onto the board and still have time for character moments as well as keeping the action moving
8342443 eddie got the original symbiote when he was praying for vengeance in a church
8342444 he meets martin li in that same church when hes praying for forgiveness and now thanks to a miracle hes cancer free hes going to live this is going to have a profound effect on eddie brock
8342445 what i really like about the scene where you see what martins touch does is that it works on the same kind of visual wavelength as the half peter parker half spider man mask its really for the readers benefits there are all these weird little anti bodies sucking what looks like this weird black tar out of eddie brocks body hey that almost looks like a little spider pattern on the anti bodies
8342446 martin the martyr li is one of the nicest people in new york city hes a philanthropist with a heart of gold he runs these homeless shelters using money from his own pocket
8342447 however martin li is probably secretly mr negative unless theres something weird going on weve seen mr negative and than theres a flash of light and martin li appears there may be more to that but i cant elaborate
8342448 theres also some very important stuff with eddie brock that happens in the issue
8342449 the story was in development before the first brand new day issue of spider man hit stores in january

8342451 i threw that out there because it sounds so cool so james bondy in fact on that last page of 568 it would have worked even better if osborn had a cat in his lap and was stroking it
8342452 working with john is one of the highlights of my career
8342453 ive coined a new phrase its kind of sick but there is a moment in the fifth chapter of new ways to die that and theres no other way to say it if youre a spider man fan youll experience a spider gasm its just such a fricking cool spider man moment
8342454 the thrice monthly shipping schedule of amazing spider man is very demanding and causes me to spend a lot of time in front of the computer
8342455 be able to approach that child in a more proactive way and de escalate a situation
8342456 that information needs to be used in not judging that student but it would inform you in how you relate to that student

8342464 just look around you the world is full of inspiration
8342465 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8342466 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8342467 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8342468 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8342469 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8342470 entrepreneurship is living a few years of your life like most people wont so that you can spend the rest of your life like most people cant
8342471 its a solid renewal plan that does come with an important number of layoffs
8342472 people knew that we were coming with a tough plan that would include tough layoffs but the good side of it is to make sure that the mill is given a competitive advantage
8342473 much sooner than later the great avenues will re open along which free men will pass to build a better society

8342475 it simply says if youre cohabitating with a sexual partner out of wedlock then you are not allowed to adopt a child or be a foster parent in the state of arkansas
8342476 why was the mother not prosecuted for something in this case contributing to the deliquency child endangerment she was aware of the detail of the relationship and knew it was sexual
8342477 also i am generally in favor of these laws but i do think that if the two involved later marry and are in a stable relationship then there is probably no need to register
8342478 once a month the sky falls on my head i come to and i see another movie i want to make
8342479 it makes me play a lot harder you never know an opportunity might arise and i might make it to the next level and i might not but i can always fall back on my degree but its always on the back of my mind i want to give them what they want i want to buy them whatever and take care of my family and my dad and my mom and that kind of motivates me
8342480 kanoa misses his dad a lot when hes gone like right now when they are at camp thats why kanoa is really excited to be here right now when we do spend time with him keao tries to make the most of it
8342481 if keao has extra time off some of the guys will go with keao and hang out with the kids and that kind of helps
8342482 i go home and to the house and i do abs and make her come outside to the yard and throw the ball and shell say no im tired already go call my brother and i say no you have to help me do you want me to make it or not i give her the old guilt trip and she gives in
8342483 my mom still teases me about still being a little kid asking how i can have kids if im still a little kid myself but its because i still like to play around it made me settle down a lot
8342484 and its not because of me hes just more focused on football
8342485 it makes you set your priorities correctly and makes you make the right decisions in life
8342486 silvas wife keilah and son kauahe 1 live in hilo and he rarely gets to see them in the spring he flew back on weekends
8342487 the family is the cornerstone for me my wife keeps me in line and we stay close and take care of our son its tough when you first leave but you just try to get through it my wife takes it hard having a child i had to mature pretty quick theres more responsibility you cant just go to the beach and play around and stuff your family is always first
8342488 the life is not necessarily hard i miss her every day but i have a job to do i need to go to school and play football so overall i think its fantastic i visit her and she tries to come down once in a while
8342489 now its crucial timing i have to play with her and spend time with her i watch tv with her we watch cartoons and i think its really fun its like being a kid all over again
8342490 unlike roberts defensive tackle josh leonard brought his fiancee christa sariaba with him when he came to uh now with 11 month old son blayne in the picture leonard said he works harder to make sure he will be able to provide for his family
8342491 id say i work a little harder to push myself and hopefully make it to the next level i matured more starting thinking about the degree and making sure im financially stable when i get older for my son
8342492 hardest part is dealing with the family life going to practice going to school going to meetings going to sleep at midnight and waking up at 5 in the morning but its good because its good having a kid im glad i have one the only way i can describe it is its just pure love for him

8342495 e temos um argumento concreto para manter essa posi o que o fato de que a taxa m dia cobrada atualmente pelas institui es est em 2 45 ao m s ou seja abaixo do teto
8342496 o governo n o est quebrando regras porque n o h regras nesse sentido

8342499 a vision an internet connection and a subscription to merx gives way to a 10m business
8342500 when barry payne founded adirondack technologies furniture inc in 2002 he had a plan to sell his furniture to the public sector in canada barry conducted preliminary market research for his new venture he was not encouraged by what others were telling him many told him that starting a new business was risky to try and start a new business focused on selling to the public sector was an impossible task the same naysayers also communicated that public sector opportunities posted on merx are not really open it would be very difficult for adirondack technologies furniture inc to win public sector contracts by using merx alone to bid on tender opportunities it didnt take long for barry payne and adirondack technologies furniture inc to dispel this myth adirondack technologies furniture inc started out as a one man business four years later it has evolved into a multi million dollar corporation based strictly on winning tenders from public buying organizations how did barry payne do it simply put he made merx his sales and marketing organization
8342501 yes virginia there is more to e procurement than software
8342502 driving the subscriber growth and therefore broader distribution of contract awards
8342503 although i am younger them him i know i would be a better wife to him and a mother to his children
8342504 deep down inside i want it to be his baby because i know financially i will be taken care of the rest of my life
8342505 long story short i found out that him and his wife were having problems and i insisted that she give him my number
8342506 me and the married man always used protection but one time the condom did bust
8342507 deep down inside i want it to be his baby because i know financially i will be taken care of the rest of my life
8342508 should i call this women and tell her that i have been sleeping with her husband and might be pregnant or should i just keep quite and tell my ex that it is his
8342509 to me she needs to be more concerned about successfully raising this child just because you have money does not mean youre going to automatically do a good job at raising a child
8342510 mom watch and see what she does not say what she does not say shes proud to be
8342511 ive got a gig until a year after the administration starts

8342513 our goal is to attract as many of our strongest students as possible to do honors
8342514 currently we are funding five students our goal down the road is to increase this to 20 students
8342515 our senior honors program is built on close student faculty collaboration and a dedication to integrating the teaching and research missions of the college
8342516 by providing research funding for both students and their faculty mentors the dintersmith fellows program provides incentives for participation in activity that embodies the essence of our values as an institution
8342517 dogs were the only domesticated animals on the east coast and the jamestown settlers recorded that they were used as hunting companions but not kept as pets
8342518 but the rituals of dog sacrifice in neighboring groups and the fact that dogs were the only animals to be buried suggests that they had a significant role in algonquian communities
8342519 it seems as if dogs are associated with human deaths because they seem to appear close to human burials in large part
8342520 so i am thinking that they are considered separate from other types of animals and the natives are treating dogs differently because they see them more as this connection with the next life
8342521 jens really developed the research topic the research interest the research project the schedule the methods and begun to move toward a bit of interpretation with some guidance but largely on her own
8342522 this is really jens research and she has taken the ball and run with it
8342523 im currently translating professor suns book on comparative literature which besides being a great introduction to comparative literary theory and practice is also improving my chinese reading skills
8342524 by working closely with a leading chinese scholar in the field and by getting involved in some of his ongoing research projects shannon is learning the chinese perspectives first hand and approaching the chinese mind closer than many researchers have been able to
8342525 the significance of shannons project lies in the fact that she is attempting to look at the issues from inside out while most english written studies on china are done from non chinese perspectives shannon asks questions such as what do the chinese people think of the issues and why do they see things in such ways
8342526 it would be hard to undertake a project on comparative literature without guidance from experts in both chinese and western literature so i consider this summers research to be indispensable to my thesis research
8342527 this is particularly impressive for someone who less than three years ago did not even know a single chinese word
8342528 we call this the embodied theory of perception which is part of the embodied theory of the brain
8342529 the embodied theory of the brain basically states that what the mind does depends on how the body feels this produces interesting consequences in perception
8342530 what dillon wants to know is like everything else in our lab does the emotion of the observer change their perception of the biological motion in the scene
8342531 while distance and motion perception is very basic even frogs see motion biological motion processing is a higher order function so we have the potential for some interesting findings here
8342532 if emotion produces any effect at all we can show empirically that it can change higher order processing
8342533 other people have made this compound but you cant buy it
8342534 everyone has to make their own its not commercially available but once she has made it maybr we can transform it into things that no ones made before
8342535 what shes trying to do in each of these steps is to add one atom
8342536 were pretty confident that were going to be done with the synthesis probably by the end of the summer and then we can start working on the fun analysis part
8342537 my project emerged largely from a wish to combine some of my classics background with a thesis in english literature
8342538 i had studied horace extensively in high school at william and mary professor potkay was responsible for exposing me to wordsworths major odes in my freshman english survey course
8342539 lindsay has a firm command of the difficult greek and latin originals and their earlier english imitations and extension against which wordsworth would have us understand and judge his achievement
8342540 there is a substantial body of secondary literature on the history of the ode form from antiquity onwards lindsay has already taken the first steps towards mastering this but little of it treats wordsworths place in this history with any detail
8342541 also i would like to assess what he contributes to the form in later romantic poets particularly keats and shelley

8342579 it took a lot less time to get the stuff into the car than seemingly to get it out of the car
8342580 the first one was a little bit easier because there was still one at home this is a little more defining in a sense its almost closure
8342581 but i think that becky is certainly looking forward to her time here at william and mary and its a gorgeous university and were looking forward to visiting
8342582 today we followed a 300 year old recipe for welcoming new students to william and mary
8342583 with the hard work and collaboration of our housekeepers facilities management orientation staff move in team volunteers information technology and the william and mary police we checked in over 90 percent of the entering students by noon with about 50 percent here before 10 a m
8342584 a mix of nerves and excitement but overall pretty good
8342585 everyones been so nice so im looking forward to meeting new people
8342586 the william and mary internship at u s headquarters in brussels for nato is unique
8342587 no other undergraduate institution in the country has this opportunity
8342588 youre thrown in right away and you have real work to do
8342589 and they all come back extremely excited and deeply appreciative of the opportunity
8342590 its going to take a lot more time to get in and out

8342594 and i promise you im doing the best i can
8342595 the nano project is an unique and innovative initiative which will establish indias position as a small car hub
8342596 this unrest will be counter productive for the countrys economic growth its global image as well as our ability to attract investments from across the world
8342597 federal revenues should have been down nearly 20 billion in the first quarter given the measures set out in last falls economic statement
8342598 instead only a 1 1 billion reduction is showing up in the national accounts
8342599 slower economic growth is a negative but right now inflation is above two per cent and were having faster nominal income growth as a consequence and that gets taxed
8342600 over the medium term the conference board expects that the federal government will be able to continue to generate fiscal surpluses
8342601 in turn this will create scope to pay down debt reduce taxes and or introduce targeted increases in spending
8342602 daraus wird zu meiner verwunderung geschlossen die kirchen w rden nun solche trauungen auch durchf hren
8342603 es geht um den verantwortlichen umgang mit dem leben das mir anvertraut ist
8342604 auch in einer gesellschaft mit unterschiedlichen weltanschaulichen positionen brauchen wir wieder raum daf r das menschliche leben als eine uns anvertraute gabe zu verstehen
8342605 deshalb ist die endliche freiheit meines endlichen lebens so wichtig da ich ihren gebrauch vor gott zu verantworten habe
8342606 thank you thank you thank you for your report on climate change im sick of hearing the debates over and writing anyone who differs off as a nut this report showed the true nature of the debate and true lack of consensus something you cant get anywhere else
8342607 your 20 20 report on global warning made me sick your sarcastic ridiculing of al gore i have lost all respect for you and your reporting
8342608 its the inter governmental panel on climate change its governments who nominate people its inherently political many of the scientists are on the ipcc because they view global warming as a problem that needs to be fixed they have a vested interest
8342609 its something for people to get excited about and protest its more about emotion than science
8342610 washington has become a placewhere good ideas go to die they go to die because lobbyists and special interests have astrangle hold on the agenda in washington
8342611 corporate occupied territory every department agency controlled by overwhelming presence of corporate lobbyists
8342612 i wouldnt think so i thought i was really gonna have a relationship
8342613 oh heck no theres a point where you draw the line somewhere
8342614 well they are but i think its a legitimate goal of public policy to discourage that
8342615 so as it well appeared that famine must still ensue the next year also if not some way prevented
8342616 began to think how they might raise as much corn as they could and obtain a better crop than they had done that they might not still thus languish in misery at length after much debate of things i with the advice of the chiefest among them gave way that they should set corn every man for his own particular and in that regard trust to themselves and so assigned to every family a parcel of land
8342617 the battle to feed all of humanity is over in the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now
8342618 sharing of the fruits of our labor is a bad thing
8342619 oh no i wouldnt use it its always those other people that might use it so i have to take care of them and prevent them from doing harm to themselves
8342620 if you build there dont sweat it were going to bail you out
8342621 i actually believed that the private sector would be able to address a lot of the issues that i believed were very important like taking care of those in need and then i saw firsthand how difficult it was one of the problems with the right is that they dont believe in facts and they dont believe in evidence and i was willing to change my mind confronted with new evidence and we would all be better off if we were willing to look at new evidence
8342622 what we need is serious government policies to address poverty
8342623 they dont work as well as they should be working but theres a lot more we can do
8342624 reform was not a success a lot of people have been left without job training and therefore without the ability to really lead productive lives
8342625 environmental extremists notable politicians among them create this wild scientific scenario of the civilization threatening environmental consequences from global warming unless we adhere to their radical agenda i have read dozens of scientific papers i have talked with numerous scientists there is no runaway climate change the impact of humans on climate is not catastrophic our planet is not in peril in time a decade or two the outrageous scam will be obvious
8342626 there were 200 000 horses in new york city at the beginning of the 20th century defecating everywhere when you walked around you were breathing pulverized horse manure
8342627 it is governments job to help workers get the education and training they need for the new jobs
8342628 just because im paranoid doesnt mean theyre not out to get me
8342629 the result of inspection failures and enforcement failure by the federal aviation administration has meant that aircraft have flown unsafe un airworthy and at risk of lives
8342630 the faa has clearly displayed a dangerous and cavalier lack of regard for tough safety enforcement
8342631 an industry wide audit commenced and faa inspectors set about finding something anything to show mr oberstar and other congressional overseers that the agency was up to the job of enforcing federal maintenance requirements to the letter
8342632 instead of idly debating the precise extent of global warming we need to deal with the central facts of rising temperatures rising waters and all the endless troubles that global warming will bring we stand warned by serious and credible scientists across the world that time is short and the dangers are great the most relevant question now is whether our own government is equal to the challenge
8342633 his plan is market based insofar as it requires an expensive invasive government bureaucracy to interfere with the
8342634 we will add to current federal efforts to develop promising technologies we will also establish clear standards in government funded research to make sure that funding is effective and focused on the right goals
8342635 the politicians are always going to inject some amount of money into the hands of consumers and into the economy like a doctor giving a lifesaving blood transfusion
8342636 but where does the economic injection come from it has to come from inside the system its not an outside stimulus like the chest paddles or the transfusion it means taking money from someone or somewhere inside the system and giving it to someone else
8342637 its like taking a bucket of water from the deep end of a pool and dumping it into the shallow end
8342638 the privileged who can afford surprisingly large fees to drive a very boring 45 minutes around metropolitan toronto highway 407 is certainly a great success for its bondholders
8342639 if it moves tax it if it keeps on moving regulate it if it ever stops moving subsidize it
8342640 hillary will impose a windfall profits tax on oil companies and use the money to temporarily suspend the 18 4 cent per gallon federal gas tax and the 24 4 cent per gallon diesel tax during the upcoming peak summer driving months
8342641 it isnt right that oil companies are making record profits at a time when ordinary americans are going into debt thats why well put a windfall profits tax on
8342642 the bettors at intrade collectively called every single race in the senate right

8342647 when it comes to providing every utah child with a quality education we believe as do most americans that our greatest hope for success is investing in research proven reforms these include the things parents and teachers know will make a difference in the classroom such as smaller class sizes and investment in teacher development programs focusing on this type of reform will bring far greater success than diverting tax dollars to an alternative education system
8342648 ultimately that is why i finally put mine back in public school for high school one needs to ensure your children can cope with the real world
8342649 most parents cannot afford to yank their kids from public schools to go private not every family can afford to have one parent forgo work to stay home to teach
8342650 as development rolls across once destitute countries at a breakneck pace lifting billions out of poverty demand for food metals and fuel is red hot and suppliers are struggling to meet it prices are spiraling and americans find themselves in what amounts to a bidding war with overseas buyers for products as diverse as milk and gasoline
8342651 the art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy
8342652 its been described as the most serious financial crisis since the great depression and it brings with it grave dangers for all american families
8342653 the difference between how the 1929 and 2008 media handled a crisis was profound with modern journalists hyping every event
8342654 the differences between todays economy and the nations darkest economic years or bothered to note that america is not in a depression

8342657 since my last report this employee has reached rock bottom and has started to dig
8342658 this employee is really not so much of a has been but more of a definite wont be
8342659 works well when under constant supervision and cornered like a rat in a trap
8342660 when she opens her mouth it seems that it is only to change feet
8342661 he would be out of his depth in a parking lot puddle
8342662 he sets low personal standards an then consistently fails to achieve them
8342663 this employee is depriving a village somewhere of an idiot
8342664 this employee should go far and the sooner he starts the better
8342665 got a full 6 pack but lacks the plastic thing to hold it all together
8342666 a gross ignoramus 144 times worse than an ordinary ignoramus
8342667 he brings a lot of joy whenever he leaves the room
8342668 if you see two people talking and one looks bored hes the other one
8342669 a photographic memory but with the lens cover glued on
8342670 donated his brain to science before he was done using it
8342671 gates are down the lights are flashing but the train isnt coming
8342672 has two brains one is lost and the other is out looking for it
8342673 if he were any more stupid hed have to be watered twice a week
8342674 if you give him a penny for his thoughts youd get change
8342675 if you stand close enough to him you can hear the ocean
8342676 its hard to believe that he beat out 1 000 000 other sperm
8342677 some drink from the fountain of knowledge he only gargled

8342682 show day is a great way to introduce incoming students to how we partner with our community working closely with them to achieve their goals while helping students to learn more about williamsburg society and themselves in the process
8342683 we hope that show day gives them a taste of service that will lead them to further community engagement whether they volunteer regularly intern create academically based projects or come up with new ways to offer their gifts to the world
8342684 it is genuinely good that we are all together for show day
8342685 service really is an important aspect of william and mary using part of our time part of our energy part of our talent to do some good in the world has always been a crucial element in william and marys ethos
8342686 i decided it would probably be a very good way to find other people who were really interested in doing community work and because at my old school i always did a lot i thought it would be another way to just make sure i started
8342687 since i got involved with service kind of late at the college id really like to see more people getting involved early
8342688 i think that coming out of high school they really arent expecting the kind of service that we do here as drew stelljes talked about earlier its really an engagement thing here its really part of the education its more than just volunteering its really what makes us william and mary students
8342689 top colleges like the university of virginia and william and mary
8342690 it is very good to see that weve more than held our own in the u s news rankings
8342691 it continues to amaze me how well william amp mary does with such modest financial resources u s news ranks us 32nd among all u s universities but only 111th in financial resources we alone have such a yawning gap between academic quality on the one hand and funding to sustain the university on the other its a testament to the extraordinarily high caliber of the faculty students and staff at william amp mary
8342692 gratifying as it is to be so recognized such distinctions come from the dedication and hard work of a talented faculty and staff working day by day with immensely talented students
8342693 we do much with little william and marys pride in its mission and its dedication to its vision as one of the great liberal arts universities would tolerate no less

8342715 i think one of the best kept secrets is that the world is in the midst of an economic boom and it is largely driven by increases in economic freedom
8342716 the world has become more free and at the same time growth is soaring to new highs during 1995 to 2005 the growth rate of per capita gdp in99 countries for which data are available has increased to 2 2 percent nearly twice the rate of recent decades since 2000 the annual growth rate of per capita gdp has been even more rapid 3 2 percent

8342727 public money going to private schools cannot bode well for the future of those schools note that the utah law requires private schools to give a nationally recognized exam one approved by the national education establishment but he who controls the exam controls the curriculum schools will have to teach to the test that will limit innovation and make the private schools more like the public schools

8342732 and consumers gain more control of their health care instead of governments and insurance companies deciding for patients patients decide competition gives consumers more choices and choice gives them power remember that when you hear a politician promise to make health case accessible and affordable through the force of government
8342733 i believe there needs to be a thorough and complete investigation of speculators to find out whether speculation has been going on and if so how much it has affected the price of a barrel of oil theres a lot of things out there that need a lot more transparency and consequently oversight
8342734 i am very angry frankly at the oil companies not only because of the obscene profits theyve made but at their failure to invest in alternate energy to help us eliminate our dependence on foreign oil theyre making huge profits and that happens but not to say were in this so we can over time eliminate americas dependence on foreign oil i think is an abrogation of their responsibilities as citizens

8342745 a general diffusion of knowledge and intelligence being essential to the preservation of the rights and liberties of the people the legislature shall encourage by all suitable means the promotion of intellectual scientific moral and agricultural improvement

8342874 you made us jump you two americans as though you had been british of what could two americans be afraid in the carnic alps to challenge a pair of wandering ibex stalkers
8342875 there are no british in italy and no italians in these mountains i fancy they have their own affairs to occupy them on the isonzo i understand also there is no war between italy and germany
8342876 soyez tranquille messieurs count von plessis permits my friends in my company to shoot the queens alm
8342877 we have a long day and a longer night ahead of us
8342878 the snow limit lies just above us the ibex should pass here at dawn on their way back to the peak shall we consolidate our front gentlemen and make it a quadruple entente
8342879 as you say we have all day and a long night before us let us make ourselves comfortable here in the sun before we take our final stations
8342880 does it interest you sir the pursuit of the diurnal lepidoptera
8342881 the schmetterling the butterfly in amerika sir you have many fine species notably parnassus clodius and the parnassus smintheus of the four varietal forms
8342882 here in the alps we possess one notable example namely the parnassus apollo it is for the capture of this never to be sufficiently studied butterfly that i have upon this ibex hunting expedition myself equipped with net and suitable paraphernalia
8342883 iss a butterfly of the larger magnitude among european lepidoptera yet not of the largest
8342884 i the life history of the parnassus apollo haff from my early youth investigated with minuteness diligence and patience
8342885 ach wass three volumes it is nothing here iss material for thirty a lifetime iss too short to know all the secrets of a single species if i may inquire sir of what pattern is your most interesting and admirable rifle
8342886 so and if i may inquire of what nationality iss it a r r ross
8342887 its a canadian weapon we americans use it a great deal for big game
8342888 so and it iss also by the canadian military employed perhaps sir
8342889 that the british government has taken away the ross rifle from the canadians and given them the regulation weapon
8342890 do you remember our ambition to wear the laurels of parnassus siurd do you remember our notes at the lectures on the poets and our ambition to write at least one deathless poem apiece before we died
8342891 to rosa oh rosa of the cafe luitpold by jove i did didnt i siurd how on earth did you ever remember that
8342892 rosa with the winsome eyes when my beer you bring to me i can see through your disguise i my goddess recognize hebe young immortally sweet nepenthe pouring me
8342893 how funny to think of it now and to think of rosa
8342894 slay eagle slay they die who dare decry us red dawns the day the western cliffs defy us turn their grey flood to seas of blood and as they flee slay eagle slay for god has willed this german day
8342895 what a terrible memory you have harry for heavens sake spare my modesty such accurate reminiscences
8342896 ibex stalking is a new game to me my friend stent tells me that you are old at it
8342897 and i am wondering whether we are to lie in this spot until dawn tomorrow or whether we climb higher and lie in the snow up there
8342898 in the snow perhaps god knows exactly where we shall lie tonight mr brown
8342899 i said to the herr professor in the traun dialect ibex may be stirring as it is already late afternoon we ought now to use our glasses my family
8342900 come from the traunwald i forget and employ the vernacular at times
8342901 why are they galloping i wonder the herd stag and stueck
8342902 noch nicht mon ami tiens a gemsbok high on the third peak feeding
8342903 you have been out since dawn was it wise for a convalescent monsieur jacques
8342904 very wise marie josephine because the more exercise i take the sooner i shall be able to go back
8342905 it is too soon to go out in such weather
8342906 and we like roast widgeon you and i marie josephine
8342907 that i do not counsel caution because i love thee and dread for thee again the trenches
8342908 thou dost not know the legion marie josephine every day in our trenches we break a comrade into pieces and glue him together again just to make him tougher broken bones once mended are stronger than before
8342909 i understand monsieur jacques that you are like your father god knows he was hardy and without fear to the last
8342910 and have put on dry clothes i shall come to luncheon and i shall have something very strange to tell you marie josephine
8342911 marie josephine a strange thing has happened on quesnel moors which troubles me listen attentively it was while waiting for ducks on the eryx rocks that once i thought i heard through the roar of wind and sea the sound of a far cannonading but i said to myself that it was only the imagination of a haunted mind that in my ears still thundered the cannonade of lens
8342912 it must have been cannon that i heard because not long afterward out of the fog came a great aeroplane rushing inland from the sea flying swiftly above me right over me and staggering like a wounded duck it had one aileron broken and sheered away into the fog northward marie josephine
8342913 in the mist flying and the ragged clouds i could not tell it might have been english it must have been i think coming as it came from the sea but i am troubled marie josephine were the guns at sea an enemys guns did the aeroplane come to earth in safety where in the forest of lais i found no trace of it
8342914 is it possible that the boches would come into these solitary moors where there are no people any more only the creatures of the lais woods and the curlew and the lapwings which pass at evening
8342915 they go usually the boches where there is plunder murder to be done spying to be done god knows what purpose animates the huns after all lorient is not so far away yet it surely must have been an english aeroplane beaten off by some enemy ship a submarine perhaps god send that the rocks of the isle des chouans take care of her with their teeth
8342916 i went from the rocks of eryx to lais woods
8342917 then i went into the wood as far as my strength permitted i heard and saw nothing marie josephine
8342918 they were planing to earth i dont know how much control they had whether they could steer choose a landing place there are plenty of safe places on these moors
8342919 if their airship is crippled what can they do these english flying men out there on the moors in the rain and wind when the coast guard passes we must tell him
8342920 after lunch i shall go out again as far as my strength allows
8342921 could i fail to try to find them englishmen and perhaps injured surely i should go marie josephine
8342922 he passed the eryx rocks at daylight he is at sainte ylva now tonight when i see his comrades lantern i shall stop him and report but in the meanwhile i must go out and search
8342923 and if thou come upon them in the forest and they are huns
8342924 go always where thy spirit calls and once he went and came no more and god help us all in finistere where all are born to grief
8342925 i say this is lucky fancy finding an englishman here wherever this place may be
8342926 of course i know im somewhere in france as the censor has it but im hanged if i know where
8342927 an enemy submarine winged us out yonder somewhere i tramped over these bally moors for hours before i found a sign of any path a sheepwalk brought me here
8342928 you are lucky there is only one house on these moors this who are you
8342929 you are in brittany province of finistere didnt you know it
8342930 the dirty weather foxed us then that fellow out yonder winged us i was glad enough to see a coast line
8342931 my pilots there now trying to patch up you are not french are you
8342932 i can get to the window with my crutches pretty well
8342933 ill have to try to get somewhere i suppose it is useless for me to ask
8342934 but have you by any chance a bit of canvas an old sail or hammock i dont need much thats what i came for and some shellac and wire and a screwdriver of sorts we need patching as well as petrol and were a little short of supplies
8342935 of course theres no petrol here theres nothing here i dont suppose you could have landed in a more deserted region if you had tried theres a chateau in the lais woods but its closed owner and servants are at the war and the family in paris
8342936 everybody has cleared out the war has stripped the country and there never were any people on these moors excepting shooting parties and in the summer a stray artist or two from quimperle
8342937 you say there is nobody here between here and lorient no troops
8342938 he has passed unfortunately otherwise he might signal by relay to lorient and have them send you out some petrol by the way are you hungry
8342939 ill stop for a bite if you dont mind while my pilot tinkers out yonder
8342940 were not in such a bad way it might easily have been worse do you think you could find us a bit of sail or something to use for patching
8342941 there are in my room a number of artists toiles old chassis with the blank canvas still untouched
8342942 what luck now to meet a painter in such a place as this
8342943 we marie josephine and i have always kept my fathers old canvases and colours everything of his ill be glad to give them to a british soldier theyre about all i have that was his except that oak chair you sit on
8342944 youll start back across the channel as soon as you secure petrol enough
8342945 you could go by way of quimper or by lorient
8342946 ive brought whats left of the shellac it isnt much use i fear but here is his hammer and canvas stretcher and the remainder of the nails he used for stretching his canvases
8342947 many thanks you also are a painter i take it
8342948 i was a writer but there are only soldiers in the world now
8342949 quite so this is an odd place for an american to live in
8342950 my father bought it years ago he was a painter of peasant life
8342951 this old peasant woman was his model many years ago she also kept house for him he lived here i was born here
8342952 yes but my father desired that i grow up a good yankee i was at school in america when he died
8342953 there was an iceland schooner wrecked off the isle des chouans and no life saving crew short of ylva light so my father went out in his little american catboat all alone marie josephine saw his sail off eryx rocks for a few moments and saw it no more
8342954 the french authorities notified me there was a little money and this hut and marie josephine so i came here and i write childrens stories that sort of thing it goes well enough i sell a few to american publishers otherwise i shoot and fish and read when war does not preoccupy me
8342955 when i was able to move i went to america but the sea off the eryx called me back and the authorities permitted me to come down here im getting well very fast now
8342956 im very glad to be of any use to you
8342957 he has the tricks of speech also his accent is of an english university there is no mistaking it
8342958 are not young huns sometimes instructed in the universities of england
8342959 gar a nous mon ptit jacques in finistere a stranger is a suspect since earliest times they have done us harm in finistere the strangers god knows what centuries of evil they have wrought
8342960 ill take him this bread and meat if i may many thanks
8342961 my darling my child oh little son of marie josephine i told thee i warned thee of the stranger in finistere marie holy intercede all all are born to grief in finistere
8342962 would you be kind enough to say to her that i arrive from lorient at her request
8342963 pardon countess may i first be certain concerning your identity
8342964 will you come in captain neeland or perhaps we had better seat ourselves on the bridge in order to lose no time because i wish you to see for yourself
8342965 it may seem absurd to you it seems so to me at times what i am going to say to you concerning lombre
8342966 i am a bretonne but until recently i did not suppose myself to be superstitious
8342967 i shall have to tell you a little about myself first so that you may understand better
8342968 then my father and my only brother died a year ago in battle it happened in the argonne i am alone we had maintained only two men servants here they went with their classes one old woman remains
8342969 i need not explain to you that our circumstances are much straitened you have only to look about you to see that our poverty is not recent it always has been so within my memory only growing a little worse every year i believe our misfortunes began during the vendee but that is of no interest except that through coincidence of course every time a new misfortune comes upon our family misfortune also falls on france
8342970 did you happen to notice the device carved on the gatepost
8342971 did you know also that there is a fish called lombre
8342972 there is it looks like a shadow in the water lombre does not belong here in brittany it is a northern fish of high altitudes where waters are icy and rapid and always tinctured with melted snow would you accord me a little more patience monsieur if i seem to be garrulous concerning my own family it is merely because i want you to understand everything everything
8342973 then it is a legend perhaps a superstition in our family that any misfortune to us and to france is always preceded by two invariable omens
8342974 is that the clocks in our house suddenly go wrong all striking the same hour no matter where the hands point no matter what time it really is
8342975 it is only to explain perhaps to justify myself for writing for asking that an officer be sent here from lorient for a few days
8342976 i understand lombre has appeared in the moat again has it not
8342977 yes it came a week ago suddenly at five oclock in the afternoon
8342978 i can very easily understand your uneasiness and perplexity madame
8342979 i believe what you have told me but i believe also that there is a natural explanation concerning these matters
8342980 i tell myself so too but i brood over them in vain i can find no explanation
8342981 is there anything in the world more likely to go queer than a clock
8342982 there are five clocks in the house why should they all go wrong at the same time and in the same manner
8342983 of course and about lombre what could explain its presence in the moat it is a creature of icy waters it is extremely limited in its range my father has often said that except lombre which has appeared at long intervals in our moat lombre never has been seen in brittany
8342984 from where does this clear water come which fills the moat
8342985 a long subterranean vein of water connects these springs with some distant alpine river somewhere in the pyrenees perhaps
8342986 have you heard any rumours concerning enemy airships or undersea boats
8342987 no but something has been happening in the aulnes etang
8342988 i dont know but every day the wild ducks rise from it in fright clouds of them and the curlew and lapwings fill the sky with their clamour
8342989 for everything there are natural causes these may always be discovered with ingenuity and persistence shall we examine your clocks madame
8342990 yes will your general be annoyed because i have asked that an officer be sent here tell me truthfully are you annoyed
8342991 but we have investigated every rumour although i personally know of no report which has been confirmed
8342992 yes aulnes wood is too remote for them to send our wounded here for their convalescence i offered aulnes then i offered myself saying that i was ready to go anywhere if i might be of use it seems there are already too many volunteers they take only the trained in hospitals i am untrained and they have no leisure to teach nobody wanted me
8342993 therefore i sew all day by the latticed window there all day long day after day and when one is young and when there is nobody nothing to look at except the curlew flying nothing to hear except the vanneaux and the clocks striking the hour
8342994 you see monsieur i am truly becoming a trifle morbid it is entirely physical my heart is quite undaunted
8342995 you heart madame is but a part of the great undaunted heart of france
8342996 yes therefore there could be no fear no doubt of god affairs go well with france monsieur may i ask without military impropriety
8342997 france as always faces her destiny madame and her destiny is victory and light
8342998 surely i knew only i had heard nothing for so long thank you monsieur
8342999 that an enemy aeroplane could land in the aulnes etang letang aux vanneaux
8343000 of course if it were anything she saw it was a real man
8343001 concerns a supposed invasion by a huge fleet of german battle planes of enormous dimensions a new biplane type which is steered from the bridge like an ocean steamer
8343002 it is supposed to be three or four times as large as their usual albatross type with a vast cruising radius immense capacity for lifting and powerful enough to carry a great weight of armour equipment munitions and a very large crew
8343003 and the most disturbing thing about it is that it is said to be as noiseless as a high class automobile
8343004 such a machine has been reported many many times as though not one but hundreds were in finistere and what is very disquieting to us a report has arrived from a distant and totally independent source from sweden that air crafts of this general type have been secretly built in germany by the hundreds
8343005 madame the countess is served these grapes grew when i was young monsieur and the world was young too mon capitaine helas but the woods of aulnes were old old as the headland yonder only the sea is older beau jeune homme only the sea is older the sea which always was and will be
8343006 light is lacking but but there will be sun enough another year
8343007 i have not felt so calm so confident in months
8343008 love and the heart may change but not the woods of aulnes they never change they never change the golden people of ker ys come out of the sea to walk among the trees
8343009 vrai cest moi anne le bihan qui vous dites cela mon capitaine and in the woods of aulnes the werewolf prowls i have seen him gallant gentleman he walks upright and in his head he has only eyes no mouth no teeth no nostrils and no hair the loup garou o lady of aulnes adored and blessed protect us from the loup barou
8343010 i have not felt so confident so content so full of faith in months
8343011 you there on the stairs do you hear what are those candles signals
8343012 its properly named it is always fatal a man may live for a few months but once gassed even in the slightest degree if that germ is inhaled death is certain
8343013 oh yes its working in the dark of course im feeling rottener every day
8343014 i dont want to die gray but i dont know how to keep alive its odd isnt it i dont wish to die its an interesting world i want to see how the local elections turn out in new york
8343015 certainly that is what worries me more than anything we allies are sure to win im not worrying about that but id like to live to see tammany a dead cock in the pit
8343016 id like to live to see this country aspire to something really noble
8343017 when light streams in from every angle no shadow is possible
8343018 the millennium i get you in this country the main thing is that there is some light a single ray however feeble and even coming from one fixed angle only means aspiration life
8343019 there is a flower called aconitum it is also known by the ominous names of monks hood and helmet flower direct sunlight kills it it flourishes only in shadow like the kaiser flower it also is blue and
8343020 it is deadly poison as you say the necessary thing in this world is light from every angle
8343021 speaking of tyranny i think it may be classed as a recognized and tolerated business carried on successfully by those born with a genius for it it flourishes in the shade like the helmet flower but the sun in this western hemisphere of ours is devilish hot its gradually killing off our local tyrants slowly almost imperceptibly but inexorably killing em off of course there are plenty still alive tyrants of every degree born to the business of tyranny and making a success at it
8343022 tyrants of politics tyrants of religion great and small we still harbor plenty of tyrants all scheming to keep their roots from shriveling under this fierce western sun of ours
8343023 also it is a state of mind a delusion a ruling passion strong even in death

8343089 that whenever the french in this sector need mules they draw on our corral we are supposed to keep ten or eleven hundred mules here all the time and look after them shipments come every two weeks i believe so after youve had another good nap george you wake up your boys and get busy and therell be trouble if things are not in running order by tomorrow night
8343090 always call on me until you learn french enough to get on understand george
8343091 a thorough knowledge of french idioms is necessary to prevent mistakes when in doubt always apply to me george for only a master of the language is competent to deal with these french people
8343092 tray chick doesnt mean some chicken it means a pretty girl in french
8343093 for thirty years msieu i have been carillonneur of sainte lesse
8343094 the carillon is ended for me the great art is no more for jean courtray master of bells
8343095 i am jean courtray carillonneur of sainte lesse have you never heard of the carillon of sainte lesse or of me
8343096 the huns have destroyed the ancient carillons of louvain and of mechlin
8343097 for denyn and for saint rombolds tower the hun has passed that way
8343098 who is it now plays the carillon in sainte lesse
8343099 you know monsieur burley you should not say tres chic to me
8343100 young men say tres chic it depend on when and how one says it
8343101 are there times when it is all right for me to say it
8343102 ready to bite or kick or eat their heads off the remount took two hundred this morning
8343103 i really thought i saw you riding away with the mules
8343104 was a bow legged driver of the train des equipages i dont think he resembles me
8343105 monsieur burley one does not so express ones self without reason without apropos without without encouragement
8343106 i shall hereafter only think you are pretty mademoiselle mais je ne le dirais ploo
8343107 merci it is not perhaps necessary to swear quite so solemnly monsieur
8343108 it is not a topic for conversation among the young monsieur what you call lamour
8343109 she is going to be gone all day today she has set and wound the drum in the belfry so that the carillon shall play every hour while she is absent
8343110 oui monsieur the mayor has asked for her she is to play for an hour to entertain the wounded
8343111 i know i wish to inspect them again before the veterinary sees them telephone to the corral for a saddle mule
8343112 really monsieur and you think it was not necessary to consult my wishes
8343113 i have been wondering who permits you to address me as carillonnette also as maryette you have been heretofore quite correct in assuming that mademoiselle is the proper form of address
8343114 tell me monsieur burley why did you desire to come with me today
8343115 is it because there were some rumours last evening concerning nivelle
8343116 and if you wish to call me carillonnette do so
8343117 i do want to and my names jack if you dont mind
8343118 stop djack that is not good manners no i was merely saying that you have done something very nice which is quite true you heard rumours that nivelle had become unsafe people whispered last evening something about the danger of a salient being cut at its base i heard the gossip in the street was that why you came after me
8343119 i had to come who could refuse our wounded there is no bell master in our department and only one bell mistress to find anyone else to play the nivelle carillon one would have to pierce the barbarians lines and search the ruins of flanders for a beiaardier a klokkenist as they call a carillonneur in the low countries but the mayor asked it and our wounded are waiting you understand mon ami djack i had to come
8343120 god watches over our trenches we shall be quite safe in nivelle
8343121 the wounded at nivelle were taken away during the night they are fighting there now in the streets
8343122 oui mademoiselle of the carillon little remains the boches have been shelling it since daylight turn again and it is better that you turn quickly because it is not known to us what is going on in that wooded district over there for if they get a foothold in nivelle on this drive they might cross this road before evening
8343123 you may have to take your mules out of sainte lesse
8343124 we are getting into trouble out here nom de dieu
8343125 but another time our wounded shall listen to your carillon
8343126 also that is no uniform known to us or to any nation at war with us that is not regulation in england that collar insignia this is a case of a franc tireur now then you there in your costume de fantasie what have you to say eh
8343127 so you are one of those yankee muleteers in your uniform and armed
8343128 whats your name you who sit here all alone at the woods edge with a dead man across your knees
8343129 to lose a friend is indeed sadder than to lose a lover what was your friends name little one
8343130 djack that is his name he was the first real friend i ever had
8343131 he is one of my countrymen an american muleteer jack burley in charge at sainte lesse
8343132 courage little mistress of the bells let us place your friend in your pretty market cart and leave this accursed place in gods name
8343133 and we ought to be on our way to sainte lesse if we are to arrive there at all allons comrade take him by the head
8343134 hes dead enough i guess but id rather hear a surgeon say so
8343135 it does one good tears are the tisane which strengthens the soul
8343136 ye es but i am remembering that that i was not very k kind to him
8343137 allons friends quarrel god understands thy friend back there he also understands now
8343138 they said he must be a franc tireur to wear such a uniform
8343139 ah the scoundrels ah the assassins and so they murdered him there under the tree
8343140 monsieur it was more serious than love it was friendship
8343141 i did not tell this poor child to hope i merely informed her that her friend yonder is still breathing but hes as full of holes as a pepper pot
8343142 allons my comrade here goes to sainte lesse drive him there now in gods name before the uhlans come clattering on your heels
8343143 explain to our little bell mistress that were taking her friend to a place where they fool death every day where to cheat the grave is a flourishing business good bye courage en route brave sister of the world
8343144 yes my machine was shot down in nivelle woods an hour ago
8343145 with jack burley a little i knew him in calais
8343146 could you tell me about him he was my first friend i did not understand him in the beginning monsieur among children it is different i had known boys as one knows them at school but a man never and indeed i had not thought i had grown up until he came djack to live at our inn the white doe at sainte lesse monsieur my father keeps it
8343147 yes that is the way he came my first friend djack with mules from america monsieur one thousand mules and god knows sainte lesse had never seen the like as for me i thought i was a child still until do you understand monsieur
8343148 yes that is how i found i was grown up he was a man not a boy that is how i found out so he became my first friend he was quite droll and very big and kind and timid following me about oh it was quite droll for both of us because at first i was afraid but pretended not to be
8343149 i was enchanted and a little frightened it being my first friendship he was so big so droll so kind we were on our way to nivelle this morning i was to play the carillon being mistress of the bells at sainte lesse and there was nobody else to play the bells at nivelle and the wounded desired to hear the carillon
8343150 so djack came after me hearing rumours of prussians in that direction they were true oh god and the prussians caught us there where you found us
8343151 anybody can weep for a friend but few avenge their dead
8343152 bread wine and some meat if you have any ill be back in a few moments
8343153 yes sir about eleven thirty this morning on the north edge of nivelle forest
8343154 it is approved but understand you are not ordered on such duty
8343155 very well munitions go to you immediately by automobile it is expected that the wind will blow from the west by morning by morning also all reserves will arrive in the west salient what is to be your signal
8343156 la brabanconne if not that then the tocsin on the great bell clovis
8343157 we quit nivelle tonight but our reserves are already coming up and we are to retake nivelle tomorrow you flew over the town this morning didnt you
8343158 then you know that our trenches pass under the bell tower
8343159 very well the wind is north when the boches enter our trenches theyll try to gas our salient while the wind holds but west winds are predicted after sunrise tomorrow im going to get into the nivelle belfry tonight with a sack of bombs im going to try to explode their gas cylinders if i can the tocsin is the signal for our people in the salient
8343160 no ill bluff it out im to have a boche uniform in a few moments
8343161 you are crazy you know what theyll do to you dont you jim
8343162 there you are ever since they got his brother hes been figuring on landing a whole bunch of huns at one clip this is going to finish him this business
8343163 you can get that note to headquarters in half an hour cant you ed
8343164 oh certainly all right then youd better be on your way
8343165 now i am ready to listen to you in the cart out on the road there you said that anybody can weep but that few dare avenge
8343166 his countrys honour and mine if he had been slain otherwise i should have perhaps mourned him confident in the law of france but i have seen the rhenish swine on french soil i saw the boches do this thing in france it is not merely my friend i desire to avenge it is the triple crime against his life against the honour of his country and of mine
8343167 i understand quite well what you mean some such philosophy sent my elder brother and me over here from new york the wild hogs trampling through belgium the ferocious herds from the rhine defacing defiling rending obliterating all that civilized man has reverenced for centuries thats the idea the world wide menace of these unclean hordes and the murderous filth of them they got my brother
8343168 method and coolness the world must keep its head clear yellow fever and smallpox have been nearly stamped out the hun can be eliminated with intelligence and clear thinking and im only an american airman who has been shot down like a winged heron whose comrades have lingered a little to comfort him and have gone on yes but a winged heron can still stab little mistress of the bells and every blow counts listen attentively for jacks sake and for the sake of france for i am going to explain to you how you can strike if you want to
8343169 we may not live through it even my orders do not send me to do this thing they merely permit it are you contented to go with me
8343170 and do you mean that you and i are to go there to nivelle
8343171 that is exactly what i mean in an hour i shall be in the nivelle belfry will you be there with me
8343172 you can play la brabanconne on the bells while i blow hell out of them in the redoubt below us
8343173 hes all shot to pieces but they say hell pull through
8343174 now that your friend jack is going to live what next
8343175 but his countrys honour and mine that reckoning still remains is it not true
8343176 you need not go with me to nivelle just because you promised
8343177 i must go of course it being a question of our countrys honour
8343178 i do not ask it nor would jack your friend nor would your own country ask it of you maryette courtray
8343179 but i ask it of myself do you understand monsieur
8343180 i brought my jacket because it is cold in all belfries it will be cold in nivelle up there in the tower under clovis
8343181 if there is to be a battle in the street here my father cannot remain
8343182 come little bell mistress take me to see your keyboard
8343183 it would be impossible for one to play unless ones hands are armoured
8343184 this playing the carillon this wonderful bell music of the middle ages there are few great bell masters in this day
8343185 i think i am the only one in france or in flanders and there are few carillons left the huns are battering them down towers of the ancient ages are falling everywhere in flanders and in france under their shell fire very soon there will be no more of the old carillons left no more bell music in the world
8343186 no it would only mean a shell from the huns
8343187 with dawn they will come creeping into nivelle the huns
8343188 i have one of their officers uniforms in that bundle above
8343189 and directly under us is the trench and the main redoubt
8343190 but with sunrise the wind changes and whether it changes or not i dont care
8343191 with the explosion of my first bomb among their gas cylinders you are to start these bells above us are you afraid
8343192 you are to play la brabanconne that is the signal to our trenches
8343193 not in the teeth of a barbarian army not in the faces of a murderous soldiery
8343194 do you think they will tear me to pieces monsieur
8343195 i mean to hold those stairs with my sack of bombs until our people enter the trenches if they can do it in an hour we will be all right
8343196 it is only a half hour affair from our salient i allow our people an hour
8343197 you said once anybody can weep for friend and country few avenge either i am happy to be among the few
8343198 ill bet you something my country is all right but its sick its got a nauseous dose of verbiage to spew up something its swallowed something about being too proud to fight my brother and i couldnt stand it so we came to france he was in the photo air service he was in mufti and about two miles up i believe six huns went for him and winged him he had to land behind their lines in mufti well ive never found courage to hear the details i cant stand them yet
8343199 oh yes with circumstances well then after that from an ordinary commonplace man i became a machine for the extermination of vermin thats all i am an animated magazine of persian powder or i do it in any handy way its not a sporting proposition you see just get rid of them any old way you dont understand do you
8343200 and the world is crawling crawling with them but if god guides my bomb this time and if i hit one of their gas cylinders that ought to be worth while
8343201 but how shall you account for me a french girl monsieur if they come to the belfry
8343202 little mistress of the bells i shall pretend to be what the huns are do you know how they treat french women
8343203 then if they come and find you here as my prisoner they will think they understand
8343204 dont be distressed does it matter what a hun thinks come lets be cheerful can you hum for me la brabanconne
8343205 but its a grand battle anthem we americans have one its out of fashion and after all i had rather hear la brabanconne when the time comes what a terrible admission but what americans have done to my country is far more terrible the nations sick sick i prefer la brabanconne for the time being
8343206 german officers are coming into the tower i want them to find you in my arms when they come up into this belfry understand me and forgive me
8343207 when i require a corps of observers i usually send my aide that being now quite perfectly understood you gentlemen will give yourselves the trouble to descend as you have come further you will place a sentry at the tower door and inform enquirers that general count von gierdorff and his staff are occupying the nivelle belfry for purposes of observation
8343208 if high command comes into this place to investigate then i shall have to hold those stairs its growing quite light in the east which way is the wind
8343209 i believe this matter is going through toss some dust into the air which way
8343210 good i think theyre placing their cylinders i think i can see them laying their coils im certain of it what luck
8343211 its growing pink in the east try a handful of dust again
8343212 lucks with us look at the east if their high command keeps his nose out of this place if he does look at the east little bell mistress its all gold theres pink up higher i can see a faint tinge of blue too can you
8343213 weve got them weve certainly got them whats that an airplane look little girl one of our planes is up theres another which way is the wind
8343214 run over to the stairs listen is anybody coming up
8343215 stand there and listen never mind the row the guns are making listen for somebody on the stairs look how light its getting the sun will push up before many minutes weve got em got em wet your finger and try the wind
8343216 north here too what do you know about that luck lucks with us and weve got em
8343217 theyre getting ready to gas below look at em glory to god i can see two cylinders directly under me theyre manning the nozzles every man is masking at his post anybody on the stairs any sound
8343218 try the dust the winds changing i think quick which way
8343219 oh glory glory to god they feel it below they know the wind has changed off came their respirators no gas this morning eh yes by god there will be gas enough for all
8343220 let the huns hear the war song of the land theyve trampled now little bell mistress arm your white hands with your wooden gloves and make this old carillon speak in brass and iron
8343221 i can hold these stairs for an hour against the whole world in arms now then the brabanconne
8343222 they said it meant the cross if i made good are you hurt
8343223 could you recite the words to me just so i could hear them on my way west
8343224 just like that well tell him from me to quit fooling away his time in a hospital and come and get you or somebody is going to steal you
8343225 but you see its djack who is convalescing not you
8343226 with his little pink eyes of a pig and his whitish hair and eyebrows well maybe they make em like that in belgium
8343227 hes an invalid student from ypres he looks quite ill i think
8343228 he looks the lunger all right but huns have it too what does he do wander about town at will
8343229 he works for us monsieur your suspicions are harsh karl is quite harmless poor boy
8343230 monsieur smith if you knew how innocent is his pastime
8343231 he collects and studies moths and butterflies is there if you please a mania more harmless in the world and now i must return to my work messieurs
8343232 ah mademoiselle fancy i haff by chance with my cultivator among your potatoes already twenty pupae of the magnificent moth sphinx atropos upturned see regard them mademoiselle what lucky chance what fortune for me an entomologist this wonderful sphinx moth to discover encased within its chrysalis
8343233 but karl those funny smooth brown things which resemble little polished evergreen cones are not rare in my garden often when spading or hoeing among the potato vines i uncover them
8343234 mademoiselle the caterpillar which makes this chrysalis feeds by night on the leaves of the potato and when ready to transform burrows into the earth to become a chrysalis or pupa as we call it that iss why mademoiselle has often disinterred the pupae of this largest and strangest of our native sphinx moths
8343235 so that is what turns into the deaths head moth
8343236 i never knew it i thought those things were legless cock chafers when i dug them out of potato hills karl why do you keep them
8343237 ah mademoiselle to study them to breed from them the moth the deaths head is magnificent
8343238 but i am afraid i could not love it when do they hatch out
8343239 it is time now it is not like others of the sphinx family incubation requires but a few weeks these are nearly ready to emerge mademoiselle
8343240 and so ardent are the lovers that although there be no female moth within five eight perhaps ten miles yet will her lover surely search through the night for her and find her
8343241 amour macabre what an unpleasant thought karl i do not care for your deaths head and for the history of their amours
8343242 your famous savant fabre first inspired me to study the sex habits of the deaths head
8343243 it was because of his wonderful experiments with the great peacock moth and with others of the genus that i have studied to acquaint myself concerning the amours of the deaths head
8343244 that i have now heard sufficient about the deaths head moth
8343245 voyons the asticot also is gone some robber fish has been nibbling
8343246 father one cannot fish and doze at the same time
8343247 eternal vigilance is the price of success in peace as well as in war
8343248 yes always now in france because always the enemy is listening
8343249 god made it it is harmless if god thought fit to paint one of his lesser creatures like a skeleton perhaps it was to remind us that life is brief and that we should lose no time to live it nobly in his sight i think that perhaps explains it
8343250 i am quite foolish to be afraid of this poor moth i repeat that i am foolish allez i am not afraid i am no longer afraid i i admire this handiwork of god
8343251 that a lover can find this creature even if he be miles and miles away
8343252 the ink if you would be so condescending and a pen
8343253 thank you i am quite well the air is mild and grateful i thank mademoiselle for her solicitude
8343254 really i can not keep my window closed for fear of visitors for you madam death i certainly shall be obliged to put you out
8343255 had you not better go over and get a gendarme
8343256 whos a spy that dutch shrimp you had in your garden
8343257 read these first we must be quite certain about what we do
8343258 then i will translate into french for you and first of all i must tell you how i came to possess these little letters written upon tissue please listen attentively
8343259 to lock his door before retiring that is what we heard
8343260 what then ails you that you do not fly to the mistress awaiting you over yonder
8343261 je fume mong peep je regard le vieux pecher voo poovay allay mademoiselle maryette
8343262 you are very kind monsieur steek smeet i shall wash your underwear the very first garments i take out of my basket thank you a thousand times
8343263 au revoir my father cheri an hour or two at the meadow lavoir and i shall return to find thee bonne chance mon pere thou shalt surely catch a large and beautiful fish for luncheon before i return with my wash
8343264 a blackbird whistles i love over the thistles butterflies hover each with her lover in love blue demoiselles that glisten listen i love wind of the west oh listen i am in love sing my song ye little gold bees opal bubbles around my knees all afloat in the soap sud broth whisper it low to the snowy froth and thou who rulest the skies above mary adored i love i love
8343265 sure maryette a old eyetalian wop used to come round town selling them he had a stick with about a hundred little balloons tied to it red blue green yellow all kinds and colours whenever i had the price i bought one
8343266 yes the gas in it wasnt much good unless you got a fresh one
8343267 sure sky high ive seen em go clean out of sight when you got a fresh one
8343268 here no it wouldnt be allowed a spy could send a message by one of those toy balloons
8343269 no children wouldnt be permitted to play with them things now maryette
8343270 then there are not any toy balloons to be had here in sainte lesse
8343271 i dont know the balloon and flying service use em too ive seen officers send them up probably it is to find out about upper air currents
8343272 i dont guess so maryette weve got the boche flyers scared stiff they dont come over our first lines anymore and our own people are out yonder
8343273 do you in fact love me a little for djacks sake
8343274 nothing it just came into my cowardly head that the path to the lavoir is lonely at sundown and there are new muleteers in sainte lesse and i must wash my clothes
8343275 no fear you wont either them mule whacking coons is white
8343276 some men who seem whitest are blacker than any negro
8343277 eh bien i thank you keed mon ami for your complaisance you are very amiable to submit to the whim of a silly girl who suddenly becomes afraid of her own shadow
8343278 your government decorates cowards thats why it gave you the legion
8343279 keed if i flew a little toy balloon in the air where would the west wind carry it
8343280 if youve got one well paint to hell with willie on it and set it afloat but well have to get permission from the gendarmes first
8343281 one does not approach people that way without a word
8343282 if i did i am very sorry and i offer mademoiselle a thousand excuses and apologies
8343283 be pleased to pass your way monsieur do you not perceive that i am busy
8343284 it is not impossible to exchange a polite word or two when people are busy is it mademoiselle
8343285 mon dieu monsieur there is liberty of speech for all in france that blackbird might be glad to know your name if you choose to tell him
8343286 you must be one of the new yankee muleteers who came with that beautiful new herd of mules
8343287 yes im an american muleteer my name is charles braun i came over in the last transport
8343288 they are friends of mine very intimate friends of course
8343289 if they are not also your friends any acquaintance with me will be very difficult for you monsieur braun
8343290 you carry old iron and bottles about with you i notice
8343291 a mule got away from the corral ive been wandering around in the bushes trying to find him
8343292 will you tell me your name in exchange for mine
8343293 that it is just a mere slip of a girl who was decorated for bravery by france
8343294 you are too amiable monsieur i really do not understand why they gave me the legion to encourage all french children perhaps because i really am a dreadful coward
8343295 you see i dare not even come here to wash my clothes unless i carry this in case some boche comes prowling
8343296 the weapon belongs to monsieur steek when i come to wash here i borrow it
8343297 perhaps you think i have time for such foolishness what with housework to do and washing and caring for my father and my duties in the belfry every day
8343298 but it will give you an hours leisure belle maryette
8343299 i shall try to instruct you why when we have our hour together
8343300 i am doing that now my ardent courtship will already be accomplished so that we need not waste our hour together
8343301 your apropos disturbs me have you the assurance to believe that you already appeal to my heart
8343302 i could not help myself your neck is so fragrant so childlike
8343303 then you should treat me as you would a child
8343304 amuse me if you aspire to any comradeship with me your behaviour does not amuse me at all
8343305 but why i am not yet old enough for such foolishness it would not amuse me at all to be alone with you for an hour
8343306 it would amuse me much more to sit here and blow bubbles
8343307 very well then children require toys to amuse them not sighs and kisses and bold brown eyes to frighten and perplex them have you any toys to amuse me if i give you an hour with me
8343308 no will you bring me a toy to amuse me a clay pipe to blow bubbles i adore bubbles
8343309 if i promise to amuse you will you give me an hour
8343310 i have my wash to finish then i have to see that my father has his soup then i must attend to customers at the inn go up to the belfry oil the machinery play the carillon later wind the drum for the night
8343311 i shall come to you in the tower after the angelus
8343312 and sit up there alone with you in the dark for an hour ma foi how amusing
8343313 suppose i bring some toy balloons for you to fly from the clock tower would that amuse you you beautiful perverse child
8343314 what pleasure to set them afloat from the belfry do you really promise to bring me some little toy balloons to fly
8343315 yes but you must promise not to speak about it to anybody
8343316 so we shall have to be very discreet and go cautiously about our sport and it ought to be great fun maryette to sail balloons out over the german trenches well tie a message to every one shall we little comrade
8343317 not one minute earlier i cannot be disturbed when playing do you understand do you promise
8343318 i promise not to bother you before half past ten
8343319 very well now let me do my washing here in peace
8343320 do you know one of the new muleteers named braun
8343321 i play the carillon after the angelus bring steek to the bell tower half an hour after you hear the carillon end you will hear it end you will hear the quarter hour strike presently half an hour later after the third quarter hour strikes you shall arrive bring pistols do you promise
8343322 i dont know yet i think we shall find a spy in the tower
8343323 in the belfry parbleu and you and steek shall come up the stairs and you shall wait in the dark there where the keyboard is and where you see all the wires leading upward you shall listen attentively and i will be on the landing above among my bells and when you hear me cry out to you then you shall come running with pistols

8343416 indeed this is the perfect and complete glorification of god when one does not exult in his own righteousness but recognizing oneself as lacking true righteousness to be justified by faith alone in christ

8343466 evidence shows that around three million years ago there was an increase in the amount of rock and debris deposited on the ocean floor around greenland
8343467 prior to that greenland was largely ice free and probably covered in grass and forest furthermore atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were relatively high so the question we wanted to answer was why did greenland become covered in an ice sheet
8343468 so why did elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations fall to levels similar to the pre industrial era that is the million dollar question which researchers will no doubt be trying to answer during the next few years

8343587 today racial inequality of opportunity and outcome in education is still the result of past generations of explicit policy decreeing that white children were to have better schools than non white children of the subsequent exacerbation of poverty along racial lines of the nations failure to actively desegregate and of the intersections between opportunity denials in health and housing as well as in education but racially unequal educational opportunity and outcome today also result from ordinary actions and inaction by well intentioned people in part within schools and districts themselves explicit resistance to opportunity for non white people today has been replaced by stated general commitments to racially equal opportunity as a basic american value but such generic commitments are often trumped by opposition to concrete efforts to equalize particular opportunities for people of color

8343617 four years ago we set out to determine the lasting future of our citys downtown core and as a result of an enormous amount of passion and commitment today we celebrate the completion of an important anchor for that vision
8343618 the noble organization has been an extremely valuable partner to us and delivered a magnificent hotel that will prove to be a great enabler to the success of the new raleigh convention center and tourism in our region the raleigh marriott city center is a perfect example of how the public and private sectors can work together to realize goals of great significance to our community

8343620 we are proud to be an integral part of this community and believe that our investment will bring a new level of hospitality and amenities that will continue to galvanize the landscape of raleighs city center

8343644 los peruanos estamos cada vez m s cerca creo que el gobierno y las autoridades deben ver esto la derogatoria de los decretos legislativos 1015 y 1073 como una oportunidad para entendernos mejor sin que se caiga en la situaci n de imposiciones de tal manera que nos permita avanzar con el tema de desarrollo y la pobreza que azota al pa s

8343673 strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries thats what kennedy did with khrushchev thats what reagan did with gorbachev thats what nixon did with mao i mean think about it iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us and yet we were willing to talk to the soviet union at the time when they were saying were going to wipe you off the planet and ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the berlin wall

8343692 has a history of terror in this hemisphere and its linkages to the bombings in buenos aires are pretty well established
8343693 one of our broader concerns is what iran is doing elsewhere in this hemisphere and what it could do if we were to find ourselves in some kind of confrontation with iran
8343694 i believe that the hardware and weapons which were used for military actions against our peacekeepers as well as for the massacre of unarmed peaceful citizens cannot be returned this is not the way it has to be done
8343695 our main task for now is to compile a full and objective list of the weapons so that they cannot be stolen or used against civilians
8343696 but the lord is in his holy temple let all the earth keep silence before him
8343697 teach me and i will hold my tongue cause me to understand wherein i have erred
8343698 species invasions and extinction the future of native biodiversity on islands
8343699 the presumption at the time was that we are driving biodiversity to lower levels
8343700 certainly if you think about it at the global level this is true because humans have done a lot of things that have driven species extinct
8343701 what dov and i worked on a few years ago is the fact that the vast majority of introductions of species dont have large negative effects
8343702 indeed most species that get introduced dont have much effect at all it doesnt mean that theyre not altering the ecosystem but theyre not driving things extinct like some of the big poster child stories weve been hearing about
8343703 the dramatic increase in the number of species has changed how the system functions
8343704 changing the abundance of natives versus exotics affects all of the other species that used to depend on the natives for food or shelter so its not in any way to say that increasing biodiversity is a good thing
8343705 that by going in and mucking up the system we may have already created the setting where too many species have been packed in and we just havent waited long enough to see these extinctions start to happen
8343706 the whole point of this study was to start looking down the path to see which of these wildly different scenarios might be right
8343707 we havent nailed the answer yet but weve set the stage for answering whether islands are now saturated or not
8343708 it was very surprising to find such a strong correlation between the number of native and exotic plant species on islands around the world
8343709 in ecological research a strong correlation often explains 50 percent of the variation here the correlation between native and exotics explains almost 100 percent of the variation in other words if you know how many native plants are on an oceanic island then you can predict almost perfectly how many exotic plants are there
8343710 which means islands that are far enough away from a continent that theyre not getting regular exchanges with the mainland
8343711 youll never know the exquisite pain of the man that goes home alone
8343712 i think the view is that it seems less likely cibc is going to have to issue equity
8343713 where i disagree is the notion that the subprime charges are declining
8343714 the reason theyre not taking subprime charges this quarter is because credit spreads declined as in these monolines are a little bit better
8343715 the brain consists of a collection of neurons cultured on a multi electro cates and controls the robot via a bluetooth connection
8343716 how memories manifest themselves in the brain when the robot revis itory
8343717 this new research is tremendously exc it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorises derstanding forward of how brains work and could have a profound effect on many areas of science and medicine
8343718 one of the fundamental questions that scientists are facing today is how we link the activ ith the complex behaviours that we see in whole organisms this project gives us a really unique opportun it complex behaviours but still remain closely tied to the activ 07 and will end on december 31 2009 here is a link to the ity of cultured neuronal networks using machine learning
8343719 in this project the neural cultures will be cultured lo cal research laboratory allowing real time access to the recording and stimulation hardware via an intranet link up
8343720 in this presentation a look is taken at how the use of implant and electro cal brains for robots to enable human enhancement and to diminish the effects of certain neural illnesses
8343721 the glimmer of hope here is that the industry as a whole is structurally profitable
8343722 there is an intentional strategy of bringing in talented hispanics who know the hispanic market and how to service it
8343723 diversity is a part of our value system part of our strategy and part of our corporate culture it provides us with a real competitive edge
8343724 the thought behind that was to make sure that diversity remains first and foremost in everyones minds as the company has grown
8343725 the company has always been engaged in the hispanic market and has always understood it
8343726 the company has always been there for the hispanic community in terms of employment and procurement
8343727 as i do operations reviews with my bosses i always read out whether ive made progress on my diversity percentages and why or why not we treat it just like any other operations metric
8343728 we would be more than happy to consider their candidacy
8343729 i have never cut an information technician from my staff during this time because peoples ability to serve themselves is one of the things i have to provide if im going to keep my doors open so we need to keep that web access happening
8343730 wow i am so proud that a woman has come this far
8343731 wow look what she can do just by being bill clintons wife
8343732 the bigamist the true story of a husbands ultimate betrayal
8343733 she didnt show up for her latest probation hearing and theres a warrant out for her arrest
8343734 getting married is complicated enough being married to three people at one time is an untenable situation for everybody

8343736 en la vida solo recordamos lo que queremos solo nosotros podemos decidir si volver a pensar en el pasado solo nosotros escogemos los sentimientos que queremos aceptar para nuestra burbuja porque nosotros decidimos c mo avanzar en nuestro camino y si merece la pena dibujar esos recuerdos en la vida en esos recuerdos y en ese pasado no podemos entrar y borrar lo que no nos gusta a mi me encantaria borrar tantas cosas tantas en muchas tuve la culpa en otras no en otras s lo pecaba de ser una ni a pero yo decid vivir sin prejuicios y decid vivir para delante con los sentimientos que tengo porque nadie me puede robar eso vivo luchando cada dia para que eso no me haga da o porque siento con un corazon que no me cabe en el pecho lleno de sentimientos y de alma y lucho cada d a porque esos sentimientos no me afecten porque muchas veces siento m s de lo que debo pero creo en la vida en el amor en la amistad en la fe en el alma y no quiero vivir en los temores de que eso me haga da o quiero ser feliz y sentir lo que me de la gana tomando el rumbo que yo quiera porque es mi decisi n pero cuando te hacen da o cuando sin querer te hacen da o y te rompen el corazon por m s que haya llorado mil veces y por m s que crea que no tengo m s l grimas se me cae alguna de los ojos y por m s experiencia que tenga y por m s consejos que me den vuelvo a llorar y es que sentir demasiado por quien no se lo merece es un error y llorar l grimas de dolor que caigan por los ojos es como sentir que tu vida no tiene sentido porque te caes caes al saber que es todo una mentira y caes cuando eres la marioneta de una pel cula que no creias que se estaba rodando pero en la vida tanto en el pasado como el presente tendr que defender que siento pase lo que pase y pese a quien le pese porque creo que sentir es maravilloso y creo que llorar por amor es un don que s lo sabemos llorarlo los que podemos llegar a amar

8343746 this potentially calls into question the ability of the bank to renew or raise additional brokered deposits and ultimately could impact overall liquidity as well calling into question the potential viability of the franchise in our view
8343747 while the bank may yet be successful in finding private equity capital to forestall additional regulatory sanctions we believe there is a good enough chance that this will not come to pass and therefore see the potential for further price degradation

8343755 arist teles em de anima 428a 1 4 deu nos uma primeira relex o te rica sobre o conceito de que se refere apenas ao processo mental atrav s do qual concebemos uma imagem phantasma a mente humana segundo arist teles n o capaz de pensar sem imagens este procedimento mental faz parte da actividade de todas as formas de pensamento e n o se confunde com o que se vir a designar por criatividade ou imagina o criativa o conceito aristot lico de est ligado ao sensus communis isto quela parte da mente psyche que respons vel pela representa o intelig vel das coisas de forma simplificada podemos dizer que o conceito de imagina o daqui decorrente consiste no processo mental de representa o das coisas que n o s o imediatamente presentes aos sentidos a imagina o uma forma de representa o do que sentimos n o existir no nosso mundo pr ximo
8343756 as palavras que t m a sua origem no grego phantas a e que vieram a evoluir em direc es pr ximas como fantasia fantasma ou fant stico acabaram por conotar quase invariavelmente tudo o que escapa realidade talvez de forma mais insistente do que o conceito de imagina o os pensadores medievais que dispunham j das duas imagina o tentaram um compromisso falhado de distin o entre imaginatio e phantasia com o pensamento moderno e o abandono do conceito aristot lico de ser entendida como uma das principais actividades da mente humana

8343780 they the marines are doing a very good job of this nation building business
8343781 its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else in a much more expeditionary environment where the marine air ground task force really seems to have a true and enduring value then thats where we need to be
8343782 more banks will come on the list as credit problems worsen

8343790 these lower workers compensation rates will have a positive impact on every segment of our marketplace
8343791 it is great news for business owners and their employees because florida employers are paying lower rates and benefits are being delivered fairly and effectively the reduction of fraud and abuse in the system is certainly paying off
8343792 bnz is one of many banks internationally that has seen an increase in attempted fraudulent transactions on cards recently used in the uk
8343793 in the belief that this step would also assist the labour party in its relationship with mr peters
8343794 mr peters subsequently met me socially at the karaka yearling sales i believe in early 2006 he thanked me for my assistance
8343795 the fact that a minister is in his job is a statement that i have confidence in them

8343800 as tom lehman said in america wed be delighted if monty is not playing
8343801 to get selected i think ive got to show some form i havent become a bad player im just sort of out of form and have been for the last month
8343802 but i feel very much more confident having had a weeks holiday away from the game and after practising here last week
8343803 hopefully im past the stage of justifying my ryder cup potential or otherwise everybody here and im sure that i speak for the captain as well understands my love for the ryder cup and thats how i will be remembered if you like
8343804 theres no resignation in any way shape or form i just felt i wanted to turn my game around and the best way to do that was practise up here and prepare the way that i have
8343805 im still five short but we will see thats what i was doing yesterday trying to find launch angles and all kind of fancy technical stuff that ive never been into before
8343806 i played well last week and i need to do the same again this week
8343807 if that warrants me or merits me a pick then fantastic

8343809 every player who plays his way into the team makes the team stronger

8343817 regrettably in many cases the emphasis has changed from the desire to provide a needy child with a home to that of providing a needy parent with a child as a result a whole industry has grown generating millions of dollars of revenue each year
8343818 those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities
8343819 anyone who knows anything of history knows that great social changes are impossible without feminine upheaval social progress can be measured exactly by the social position of the fair sex the ugly ones included
8343820 the individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe
8343821 the wisdom and quality of traditional marriage in the sense that 2 people do not engage in sexual relations before marriage period
8343822 i say to you that whoever divorces his wife except on the ground of fornication and marries another commits adultery
8343823 has disowned the faith and is worse than a person without faith
8343824 above all things have intense love for one another because love covers a multitude of sins
8343825 clothe yourselves with the tender affections of compassion kindness lowliness of mind mildness and long suffering continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely if anyone has a cause for complaint against another even as jehovah freely forgave you so do you also but besides all these things clothe yourselves with love for it is a perfect bond of union
8343826 lord how many times is my brother to sin against me and am i to forgive him

8343829 may allah curse enemies of muhammad saww and ale muhammad as and their supporters
8343830 if a man makes a hole in a watermelon or a piece of dough or a leather skin or a statue and has sex with it then this is the same as what we have said about other types of masturbation i e that it is halaal in the same circumstances given before such as being on a journey in fact it is easier than masturbating with ones hand
8343831 if a man is torn between continued desire or releasing it and if this man does not have a wife or he has a slave girl but he does not marry then if a man is overwhelmed by desire and he fears that he will suffer because of this someone like a prisoner or a traveller or a pauper then it is permissible for him to masturbate and ahmad ibn hanbal is explicit on this furthermore it is narrated that the companions of the prophet s used to masturbate while they were on military expeditions or travelling
8343832 if a person marries a mahram mother sister daughter aunt etc and has sexual intercourse with them and even admits the fact that he knew while performing the marital rites that it was haraam for him to do that even then according to imam abu hanifa he is not subject to any type of islamic penalty
8343833 if someone marries five women at a time or marries a fifth woman while already having four wives or marries his sister in law or mother in law and then performs intercourse with her and then says that i knew that it is haram for me or performs nikah al mutah with a woman then there will be no plenty of adultery on him in all of these situations though he confessed that he knew it was haram on him
8343834 the product is safe to humans animals and the environment
8343835 people are becoming more aware of the negative effects of conventional pesticides at the same time growers are more willing to switch they have more choices and incentive compared to 10 years ago
8343836 i think there has been enough scientific evidence that theres a difference between lets say conventional tomatoes and organic tomatoes in terms of pesticide residues but also improved taste and higher levels of antioxidants
8343837 i think its a combination of the movement of green chemistry trying to protect the environment and peoples thoughts about their own health maybe not even their health but their kids and grandkids health

8343844 i think abdullah should strongly consider for all our sakes to step down now
8343845 this is a second time that the malaysian people have given a clear message with the first at the general elections it is a rejection of the present leader and he must leave now
8343846 i know nothing with any certainty but the sight of stars makes me dream
8343847 there were so many fewer questions when stars were still just the holes to heaven
8343848 keep your eyes on the stars and your feet on the ground
8343849 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8343850 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example
8343851 the language centre of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain
8343852 this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
8343853 the brain areas that are responsible for language in an adult do not learn how to process language during development but rather they are specialized at least in part to process language from the start
8343854 and besides all that what we need is a decentralized distributed system of depositing electronic files to local libraries willing to host them

8343863 camp tov teaches the value of volunteering at an early age
8343864 the camp showed me that volunteering aside from the obvious benefit to the people being helped provides the volunteer with a sense of fulfillment and possibly more importantly a window into the way someone else lives the camp educated the campers about volunteer organizations in chicago and provided us with the tools not to mention the motivation that we need to volunteer on our own in the future
8343865 there are a lot of positives that come from this game even though we got a loss
8343866 our biggest struggles have been consistency and focus but tonight we put it all together
8343867 we are young this year we dont have any seniors
8343868 some of these girls have never been in these positions before
8343869 our front row is dominating our passes are getting to the front row and we can hit it usually we just have good passes but tonight we put it all together
8343870 that was the summer of 1963 when everybody called me baby and it didnt occur to me to mind that was before president kennedy was shot before the beatles came when i couldnt wait to joint the peace corps and i thought id never find a guy as great as my dad that was the summer we went to kellermans
8343871 i called 63 the last summer of liberalism because it was the last summer you thought you could reach out your hand and make the world better and do it through peaceful and loving means
8343872 something happens to them while theyre in front of the movie

8343874 this was the generation many of them first generation americans that was coming out of the memories of the war
8343875 they loved america and there was a great desire to make the world safe they thought the jews were going to be safe now because world war ii was over and the next group that needed help was those who were then called negroes
8343876 i used to joke with my friends about doing shakespeare
8343877 people would say juliette you should play juliette and i would say i dont know because everyone has an idea of juliette and who she is thats a lot of pressure so when i got the job playing baby my friends would call and tease me
8343878 its about a feeling that there is a secret dancer inside you that can connect you to the world
8343879 people who have never danced before people who dance all the time people who always thought they could dance see the show everyone has a secret dancer inside
8343880 i am very proud of our guys tonight they did a very nice job
8343881 they played a very good game my hat goes off to the olentangy orange players they did very well the first 30 minutes we played calm pace very much to our style they ended up doing a lot of the chasing in the first half in the second half it completely turned around
8343882 that is what i am really proud of from the defense end what our guys did as a group and a collective effort if i dont get that from them i would be really surprised i should see that for the rest of the season
8343883 its a really young season and there are things our team needs to work on just like any team needs to work on things
8343884 we talked about how can we learn from this game how can we do better that is what we need to take from this game how can we be better i want our guys to succeed at the first half level they gave tonight not just the first 40 minutes but the last 40 minutes as well
8343885 they have always been very physical and very strong in the past
8343886 its always a hard game especially at their place i would not expect anything less they should be expecting a dog fight
8343887 i think it gave the players a lot of confidence
8343888 but we also know that theres things that we still really need to work on as a team i think they did a good job adjusting today and playing their game on their side of the net
8343889 we passed really well today but theres always room for improvement
8343890 the girls were talking a lot but theres always room for more talking on the court i think that the biggest thing we need to improve on is just meshing more as a team coming together more
8343891 i had a really big talk with them about staying focused doing their job and paying attention to what needs to be done on our side of the net
8343892 i think they really did their job and they listened to that
8343893 i think everyone is playing well and will continue to improve we really dont have a focus on one person this year were kind of working together as a team

8344202 we dont want to ever cut players but thats the nature of the business we didnt want it to end this way but were 3 5 let me define a players job their job is to win and otherwise why are we here taking all this abuse when we make changes we think will allow us to do something different

8344216 lawyers are familiar with this phenomenon in fact they use it to their advantage they know that if you want to hide damaging information about a case theres nothing like a document dump to do the trick you make the facts freely available along with so much irrelevant data that no one will ever find them
8344217 but the implications for our democracy are troubling to achieve their goals political movements need to reach and influence tens of millions of citizens despite conventional thinking that the internet helps spread information such reach is actually impossible online

8344220 but wait a minute if the nhas low cost housing awardees are the problem why include middle class member borrowers from sss gsis and pag ibig thats the problem with elitist politicians they lump together the dirt poor and the working class as all living in houses much smaller than their mansions in the process they mix up state welfare projects with private lending for housing
8344221 the sss gsis and pag ibig have their own rules and penalties for delinquent loan repayment depending on the gravity the borrower may be blacklisted or the house repossessed at times the private funds also offer amnesties in short the three act according to their respective financial capabilities congress must not dictate on them just to make a few senators and congressmen look good in time for reelection

8344231 traditional mass media is not a growth business and so to continue to resonate and be relevant broadcast stations need to basically embrace digital media including the web youll actually continue to have a healthy viable broadcast business but you have to accept its not growing and its becoming less and less relevant to particular target audiences
8344232 the networks and the stations have to recognize that theyre in the video information and entertainment delivery business a broadcast station limits what they can actually do
8344233 lets say on television you get a cost per thousand rate fifty cents a click is equal to 0 cost per thousand you can see how much more expensive it is but the difference is theres some sort of action
8344234 it will simply allow people to get a national footprint and my sense is national advertising is not competitive with local advertising today spot cable basically sort of sits in between the worst of the programming and its hard to buy canoe is partly about making it easier to buy part of it is basically going to be make it more measurable local stations will have both the opportunity of trying to figure out how to be more measurable and the threat that theyve got some other measurable media competition
8344235 reach far beyond the social media advertising category and to target far larger portal advertising budgets

8344253 the fact that most americans are not exclusive or dogmatic about their religion is a fascinating finding
8344254 most people will be surprised that a majority of adherents in nearly all religious traditions including a majority of evangelical protestants say that there isnt just one way to salvation or to interpret the teachings of their own faith
8344255 this report illustrates chapter and verse the amazing diversity and dynamism both between and within religious traditions in america
8344256 and this diversity of affiliation belief and practice matters when it comes to social and political questions
8344257 it answered a lot of my questions it gave me the tools to help arrive at those answers
8344258 the last time i checked that was not against the law
8344259 i have not seen where robert burton has crossed the line
8344260 there are people who want these kinds of things to be believed
8344261 i see him as a person who got it right spiritually
8344262 hes in a position to be a guide for other people
8344263 no one has ever joined the fellowship because of the predictions
8344264 it was never the center of what we were doing
8344265 im very happy the civilization we know has not collapsed
8344266 relative to us it is divine relative to powers higher than himself he is not
8344267 has come to understand the esoteric nature of all spiritual teachings throughout recorded time
8344268 he has concluded that all religious traditions are the same and that the basis of all great spiritual work is the same to escape from imagination and the lower self and to awaken and recognize ones higher self
8344269 jesus said when he was 12 that he must be about his fathers business this does not refer to his age but to world 12 within him
8344270 for people who are not satisfied with the traditional religions
8344271 we are ready to say that this is an unauthorised action but we respect the czech police who have recommended to us not to escalate the situation
8344272 we also recovered four ak 47 riffles and 400 rounds of live ammunition some of the gunmen fled through a river we advise residents of the affected areas not to panic
8344273 do all they can to support the proposed constitutional amendment
8344274 therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh
8344275 have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh
8344276 gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal mortal and eternal identity and purpose
8344277 so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them
8344278 the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society
8344279 it wont affect you so why should you care is the common refrain while it may be true that allowing single sex unions will not immediately and directly affect all existing marriages the real question is how it will affect society as a whole
8344280 we call upon responsible citizens and officers of government everywhere to promote those measures designed to maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society

8344285 besides his wealth and success buffett is also well known for his philanthropic work he has taught his shareholders to not just focus on making wealth but also on distributing it back to the world to help the needy
8344286 mostly they teach you compassion for people to be humble to open your heart to people
8344287 it must have been the masters power letting me know that those thoughts were wrong
8344288 she is a master a person who realized her own god nature a true nature that does not change from life to life
8344289 the problem with running a campaign thats based on cult of personality is that cracks in the grandiose facade of obamas life become very damaging
8344290 thats where you can get a readers attention and have substantial impact
8344291 is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited
8344292 the reality is there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off a presidential campaign
8344293 the book is going to change a lot of opinions
8344294 its a different version of the man than hes been presenting
8344295 this is an attempt to perpetuate those politics for four more years
8344296 one of the reasons i wrote this book is to keep obama from getting elected
8344297 as it became clear that he was going to win the democratic nomination for president it seemed irresponsible to stand by as so many were offering admiration piety even worship to of all things a politician because the idea of barack obama as a reformer is a great lie
8344298 one thing weve learned so far with biographies in the 21st century is that every book is going to be one persons take

8344300 no ufo reported investigated and evaluated by the air force was ever an indication of threat to our national security there was no evidence submitted to or discovered by the air force that sightings categorized as unidentified represented technological developments or principles beyond the range of modern scientific knowledge and there was no evidence indicating that sightings categorized as unidentified were extraterrestrial vehicles

8344311 sometimes ladies and gentlemen the truth is stranger than fiction
8344312 the story is based on experiences from heidi johnson who served a mission in austria
8344313 weve really tried to strike a good balance between making a humorous entertaining fun film but also having a spiritual aspect to it
8344314 it really is a realistic portrayal of missionary work with all its ups and all its downs so its really kind of bringing that all together
8344315 its a film that you leave still thinking about it and it will probably be something you can come back to and reflect on
8344316 science is a highly elaborated set of conventions brought forth by one particular culture our own in the circumstances of one particular historical period thus it is not as the standard view would have it a body of knowledge and testable conjecture concerning the real world it is a discourse devised by and for one specialised interpretive community under terms created by the complex net of social circumstance political opinion economic incentive and ideological climate that constitutes the ineluctable human environment of the scientist thus orthodox science is but one discursive community among the many that now exist and that have existed historically consequently its truth claims are irreducibly self referential in that they can be upheld only by appeal to the standards that define the scientific community and distinguish it from other social formations
8344317 there are in fact two things science and opinion the former begets knowledge the latter ignorance
8344318 the major strength of science is that the information we derive from it is independent of our beliefs and preconceptions
8344319 if the misery of the poor be caused not by the laws of nature but by our institutions great is our sin
8344320 how paramount the future is to the present when one is surrounded by children
8344321 i have steadily endeavoured to keep my mind free so as to give up any hypothesis however much beloved and i cannot resist forming one on every subject as soon as the facts are shown to oppose it
8344322 consequently its truth claims are irreducibly self referential in that they can be upheld only by appeal to the standards that define the scientific community and distinguish it from other social formations
8344323 and in some cases im looking at you religion this trait has been extremely detrimental to logical thought
8344324 in order to survive we have evolved to find cause and effect relationships in nature and then weave a plausible story to explain them
8344325 scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty some most unsure some nearly sure none absolutely sure
8344326 encourages the critical investigation of paranormal and fringe science claims from a responsible scientific point of view
8344327 to upset the conclusion that all crows are black there is no need to seek demonstration that no crows are black it is sufficient to produce one white crow a single one is sufficient
8344328 the universe is not only stranger than we know it is stranger than we can know
8344329 itll drive the conspiracy nuts crazy but theyll never figure it out
8344330 is there extraordinary evidence for the extraordinary claim evidence is key normal claims need normal evidence but extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence
8344331 the problem is not what you dont know its what you know that aint so
8344332 this is the first time since the englightenment when the word skeptic has been a term of abuse
8344333 that 9 11 was orchestrated by the us government to galvanise america for war why do so many people believe such weird things
8344334 would you be surprised to learn 911 was an act of the us government
8344335 i think this is true but i dont have any proof
8344336 i dont care that all the proof is against it it must be wrong i am right
8344337 how does the claim fit with what we know about how the world works when considered in this manner get rich quick schemes and stock market secrets never sound so good
8344338 is there extraordinary evidence for the extraordinary claim evidence is key normal claims need normal evidence but extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence
8344339 have the claims been verified by another source typically pseudoscientists will make statements that are unverified or verified by a source within their own circle who is checking the claim and who is checking the checkers
8344340 parents may be free to become martyrs themselves but it does not follow that they are free in identical circumstances to make martyrs of their children
8344341 pain has no right to exist because god did not authorize it
8344342 we cannot find any record to show that we could have intervened before javon died
8344343 i spoke to people who would not give me the time of day
8344344 they bluntly said to me during one call that they needed proof they said they could not go out they said i am probably just making it up and it is just hearsay
8344345 i was telling them about all of these aliases the members of the religious group were using everyone was very cooperative
8344346 i made one phone call and new york was in the house the next day
8344347 it crushed me because i knew my little baby was in danger and i was reaching out and nobody was concerned about a baby in danger
8344348 the truth only holds if it makes perfect sense to you it is not what someone else thinks it to be if you believe something is true and you have seen it work for yourself no one else can discourage you from that
8344349 we have been told from an early age that if we do wrong we shall die and go to a frightening place called hell we believe that what others perceive as sin are just the negative memories stored by our brain once we confess and confront them they cease to haunt us and we regain our freedom
8344350 when christians say you can move mountains by faith they are not far from the truth once you unlock your spirituality you will be able to do exactly that
8344351 obtain an assault weapon legally preferably ak 47 or variations
8344352 regular purchases of weapons and ammunition from flea markets and gun shows
8344353 one of the protesters came into the store and i asked them why they were here
8344354 they said they are anonymous and were protesting the scientologists who opened a office down the block
8344355 scientology is some sort of space alien brain washing cult thing my moms friend got into it from doing acting courses and tried to talk my mom into joining but my mom read up on it and told her it was bs and so her friend stopped talking to her as far as the people in masks i say good for them they are passing out information that people need to know so they can make informed decisions
8344356 we know who you are and you are and you are
8344357 those arent even out cars hes just trying to intimidate us

8344359 but he also had a tilt to his pelvis and some back pain his symptoms were very similar to whiplash
8344360 we support the creation of this ufo trail because experts say that it is a hot zone for watchers
8344361 in no way can we guarantee that a tourist coming to san clemente will see a ufo
8344362 it was an orange object located about 400 meters 1 312 feet in the distance with oscillating movements
8344363 there sightings have been made of shining spheres going into the water and into wooded zones without any human explanation
8344364 any action that is disruptive or undertaken to disrupt or disturb a funeral or burial service or a funeral procession
8344365 as respondents assert deep tradition and social obligation quite apart from the emotional support the grieving require compel individuals to attend a funeral or burial service
8344366 accordingly we agree with the district courts conclusion that ohio has an important interest in the protection of funeral attendees because a deceaseds survivors have a privacy right in the character and memory of the deceased
8344367 as respondents argue phelps roper has an international audience with her website where her message is seen by millions and she has appeared on national radio and television
8344368 recently the neo nazis have been snapping up warehouses or empty supermarkets where they can stage their rallies
8344369 i am tired of this satanism i cant leave them so i am hanging myself
8344370 i cannot explain what i am feeling i am trying to be strong for my other two kids
8344371 ntombikayise has mentioned this satanism church before we never took her seriously
8344372 she came home from school as usual on tuesday and i sent her to the shops
8344373 when she came back she went straight to her room
8344374 it baffles me delisile was a happy child she loved playing and dancing
8344375 we dont know why two youngsters would kill themselves within such a short space of time
8344376 pressures and burdens which have helped to create an atmosphere of fatigue and stress that has exacerbated existing issues in the bentleys relationship we want to affirm that there has been no sexual immorality on the part of either todd or shonnah
8344377 in his late teens todd had a dramatic encounter with the saving and delivering power of god this experience brought todd out of a lifestyle of drug and alcohol addiction without cravings or withdrawal symptoms he was also delivered from a lifestyle involving criminal activity youth prisons drugs sex satanic music and bondage
8344378 i had to be obedient to the lord sir why did the preacher just knee you in the gut i tell you the lord is working in you you felt a quivering
8344379 as unbelievable as it may sound i actually saw the apostle paul come walking toward me onto the bridge
8344380 you might be wondering how i knew immediately that it was paul i just perceived it by divine knowledge and revelation people have asked me what he looked like and so i will attempt to describe his appearance he was short not more than 51
8344381 but i suppose im one of those who is moderately skeptical these things are rarely black and white
8344382 im sure the demands of that kind of life can be extreme putting pressures on families
8344383 let all bitterness wrath anger clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice 32 and be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god in christ forgave you
8344384 wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall
8344385 among those who jumped on the lakeland bandwagon discernment was discouraged
8344386 im now convinced that a large segment of the charismatic church will follow the anti christ when he shows up because they have no discernment
8344387 do not lay hands upon anyone too hastily and thereby share responsibility for the sins of others
8344388 for my thoughts are not your thoughts nor are your ways my ways
8344389 for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
8344390 these things are not just made up the format of a curse or spell must be based on real examples from the classical period and reflect the beliefs of the practitioners
8344391 in their many guises magic and witchcraft have been important features of most societies whether approved of or feared by non practitioners
8344392 the questions that need to be asked of any tertiary education are what are they doing to create good citizens and what are they doing to ensure the skills are transferable
8344393 citing the bible as evidence for anything is like me citing greek mythology as evidence that the the sun is in fact a chariot of fire that races across the sky
8344394 make sure the brain is in gear before opening your mouth
8344395 lets dispell some fear and debunk some more religious myths
8344396 i have first hand experienced demon posession and the occult
8344397 my religion is little more than a glorified social club and doesnt offer a single scrap of intellectual or spiritual nourishment in fact my religion is so unfulfilling and unappealing that im afraid the second most christians become aware of an alternative theyll immediately convert to it abandoning christian belief
8344398 the more christians convert away from christianity the less cash is left in the collection plate after church services and the less political influence my religion has as a group therefore we must stop people from being exposed to other alternatives at all costs
8344399 we hold that the changes called creation and procreation are divine and that human sexuality is to humans the most available expression of that function of divinity
8344400 sexual activity is the greatest act a human can do
8344401 the defendants design was to operate a church oriented school which is free of any governmental regulation for the ostensible purpose of education when their real goal was to gratify their own deviant sexual desires
8344402 he preys on at least he did the people who believed in him
8344403 thanks to the christian crazies who were and are so influential in this country america has criminalized more sexual conduct than any other western nation
8344404 there is nothing injurious to sexuality its good and pleasant not an evil children exposed to it are simply not injured
8344405 do i have to worry about whats happening with my kids i have to try to do something
8344406 they have scars they say will never go away theyre frightened
8344407 we are taking this sighting seriously because the shape of the bat wings is very rare and there was also more than one witness
8344408 out of hundreds of sightings nationally this summer we believe this is the first bat winged object
8344409 we use scientific techniques to try and prove or disprove whether something is paranormal or a natural or man made occurrence
8344410 does a coach make a swimmer great or does the swimmer make the coach great
8344411 we kept taking too long to pass the ball people were taking too many people on we never held it up front for any length of time
8344412 when mehdi went through the middle the whole game changed because we got ball to feet bryson was magnificent second half
8344413 i gave them a lot of praise at the end of the game because if youre going to give them stick its only right when they do well that they get the praise
8344414 the man of the match for me was manuel pascali i thought he was outstanding winning every header switching play destroying moves
8344415 the vast majority of haredim are opposed to the use of violence
8344416 but when the iniquities are taking place right next door anybody in their right mind would do what it takes to put an end to the madness
8344417 you will stand alone naked and alone for your final judgment before that holy god in whose face you regularly spit
8344418 meanwhile wbc will picket your funerals which especially in the case of elizabeth if she is telling the truth about her breast cancer might not be too far off
8344419 its smearing baptists to call it the westboro baptist church
8344420 if you challenge him you have to leave the cult
8344421 one person standing on the side presents no threat to anyone
8344422 i experienced a conscious birth like a woman delivering a baby
8344423 it came upon me there was a bolt of lightning smoke and an earthquake my higher centers fused world 6 and 12 were there it lasted for about 15 seconds the smoke then vanished
8344424 it was as if someone had shot a bullet between my eyes and i was looking at them unmoved
8344425 to make you think all the time about what youre saying
8344426 fellowship of friends is a cult whose sole purpose despite its claims supporting its tax exempt status is to satisfy the sexual financial and power needs of robert burton the leader
8344427 burtons word is law and cannot be questioned because he is awake while his followers are asleep and therefore cannot think for themselves
8344428 cults induce brainwashing an inducement into an ideology that then gets practiced
8344429 you are not supposed to be leaving your family youre supposed to be becoming free of your unnecessary ties
8344430 i was treated as though i was saying something wrong
8344431 every time you turn around youre getting nickled and dimed
8344432 she wasnt going to be buffaloed and intimidated and go away
8344433 the fellowship cannot hurt me more than it has already hurt me
8344434 i may not be able to stop them but ill be a huge pebble in their shoe until the end of time

8344437 you may visit this store only once there are 6 floors and the value of the products increase as you ascend the flights you may choose any item from a particular floor or may choose to go up to the next floor but you cannot go back down except to exit the building
8344438 but one condition if you so much as lay a finger on my daughter i will inflict upon you the three worst chinese tortures known to man
8344439 if thats the best the old man can do then i dont have much to worry about
8344440 we kept taking too long to pass the ball people were taking too many people on we never held it up front for any length of time
8344441 when mehdi went through the middle the whole game changed because we got ball to feet bryson was magnificent second half

8344447 there were other young lads he used to be friendly with at church so there was nothing unusual
8344448 i found it really very nice that martyn took an interest and that he and my son became friends
8344449 he used to be such a jolly little boy and then seemed to become depressive
8344450 ive had blood thrown on me til the cows come home
8344451 re hrc supporters why do you think she lost i think she lost because obama has a new refreshing message he has invigorated people
8344452 im an outsider i will bring change i will end politics as usual
8344453 its part of their belief system that this is not the right thing to do
8344454 this outbreak at least got going because it took hold in an unimmunized community so they are the ones who are really sitting ducks for infection
8344455 weve tried to do advertising to the general public about the importance of not sharing spit because thats how this thing has spread
8344456 brodkin said people should cough and sneeze in their sleeve
8344457 weve tried to do advertising to the general public about the importance of not sharing spit
8344458 everyone is being advised not to share water bottles drinking cups musical instruments and cigarettes
8344459 i dont want the cameras around stop the cameras get my mic give me two minutes to myself
8344460 girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short wear shirts and boots because its ok to be a boy but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading because you think that being a girl is degrading but secretly youd love to know what its like wouldnt you what it feels like for a girl
8344461 the ryder cup has brought the best out of me everybody tells me why dont you just play the way you play in the ryder cup
8344462 to get selected i think ive got to show some form i havent become a bad player im just sort of out of form and have been for the last month
8344463 but i feel very much more confident having had a weeks holiday away from the game and after practising here last week
8344464 hopefully im past the stage of justifying my ryder cup potential or otherwise everybody here and im sure that i speak for the captain as well understands my love for the ryder cup and thats how i will be remembered if you like
8344465 theres no resignation in any way shape or form i just felt i wanted to turn my game around and the best way to do that was practise up here and prepare the way that i have
8344466 im still five short but we will see thats what i was doing yesterday trying to find launch angles and all kind of fancy technical stuff that ive never been into before
8344467 i played well last week and i need to do the same again this week
8344468 if that warrants me or merits me a pick then fantastic
8344469 most of us would have liked to see him trying to qualify
8344470 every player who plays his way into the team makes the team stronger
8344471 he seems to have been on a hotline to nick for a while but it would have been nice for him to have played here

8344515 los trabajadores decidieron firmar e incorporarse a sus trabajos como consecuencia de la pol tica del miedo y la amenaza que el ayuntamiento ha ejercido sobre los trabajadores pues decir que quien no se subrogue lo despiden dejaba claro lo que ocurrir a les han dicho o lo tomas o lo dejas y ellos se agarran a un clavo ardiendo ante esta amenaza era dif cil tomar otra decisi n

8344527 last friday at the end of the work day i went to my boyfriends office wearing a leather coat when all the other people had left i slipped out of it and all i had on was a leather bodice black stockings and stiletto heels he was so aroused that we made mad passionate love on his desk right then and there
8344528 thats pretty much my story when my fiance got home last friday he found me waiting for him in a black mask leather bodice black hose and stiletto pumps he was so turned on that we not only had sex all night he wants to move up our wedding date
8344529 i did a lot of planning i made arrangements for the kids to stay over at grandmas i took a long scented oil bath and then put on my best perfume i slipped into a tight leather bodice a black garter belt black stockings and six inch stilettos i finished it off with a black mask

8344531 following jesus into the mission field is either impossible or extremely difficult for the vast majority of congregations in the western world because of one thing they have a system story that will now allow them to take the first step out of the institution in to the mission field even though the mission field is just outside the door of the congregation

8344533 ana had left it on the bedside table open to this chapter which richard found boring and implausible he leafed ahead to the part where odysseus strings his bow and slaughters all the suitors but there was a lot more fancy description and speechifying than he remembered from the version hed read as a kid

8344547 quella che sta nascendo in queste ore una compagnia la nuova alitalia dice che nasce con un numero molto ridotto di aerei rispetto alle altre compagnie di bandiera europee non nasce una compagnia di bandiera in grado di servire le esigenze del paese collegandolo efficacemente con leuropa e con i cinque continenti nasce invece un monopolista piccolo piccolo che proprio perch monopolista costituisce un freno
8344548 monopolio della tratta milano roma e dal monopolio delle rotte
8344549 se non verranno liberalizzate attraverso la revisione degli accordi bilaterali penalizzeranno gli utenti che saranno costretti a pagare tariffe pi care di quelle europee e evidente che se una compagnia debole come alitalia non poteva reggere due hub nazionali ancora pi evidente la difficolt di una compagnia piccola come la nuova alitalia nel tenere il passo e dare un servizio efficiente al paese

8344558 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
8344559 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
8344560 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
8344561 our study showed that a component of a patients blepharoplasty procedure should almost routinely involve fat excision rather than these procedures

8344585 hay que tener en cuenta que s lo la producci n de madonna son 88 trailers por lo que se necesita a mucha gente aunque ella ya trae a 500 personas

8344587 la importancia de promover el trasporte p blico para acceder al concierto
8344588 por ello se sacaron a la venta m s de 3 000 tickets de tren de cercan as que ya se han vendido
8344589 con el ticket se podr coger cualquiera de los autobuses en un intervalo horario determinado y lo mismo ocurrir para la vuelta donde durante unas cuatro horas se podr coger otro autocar para volver
8344590 para promover que la gente por ejemplo acuda a cheste por la ma ana y desde all coja un autob s que le desplazar hasta el circuito y despu s de devuelva a la localidad valenciana
8344591 lo que sobre todo se quiere conseguir con todas estas medidas es el escalonamiento tanto en la llegada como en la salida de los asistentes al concierto de madonna para evitar el menor n mero de atascos y problemas en las carreteras
8344592 as intentamos lograr que no todo el mundo se vaya cuando acabe el concierto
8344593 tambi n es recomendable que si se va en coche se intente que vayan llenos para que se reduzca su n mero lo m ximo posible y que no se colapsen los accesos
8344594 lo que de verdad queremos es que cuando a las 22 00 horas la gira sticky amp sweet tour de madonna comience en el circuito de cheste todo el mundo est dentro
8344595 si el d a del concierto a n quedan entradas a la venta tambi n se podr n adquirir en la fnac pero nunca en el circuito ya que queremos evitar al m ximo las aglomeraciones
8344596 habr n unos 88 trailers por lo que no va a faltar el sonido y se oir con la misma calidad en cualquier punto del recinto

8344843 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8344844 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8344845 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8344846 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8344847 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8344866 and in exchange for this promise of limitless possibility this tantalizing what could be new york requires of these dreamers that they pursue two simultaneous lives the romantic invigorating spectacular life you imagine for yourself and the expensive often dispiriting intermittently grueling day to day life you have to lead in order to keep that dream life alive this is exhilarating this is exhausting this is what new york is all about
8344867 but i am here to tell you that this is not a story of defeat rather its a story about choices its a story about reaching that pivotal moment when the dream life you imagined for yourself in new york no longer seems attainable or attractive or simply no longer seems worth the wearying chase its a story admittedly about the kinds of people who have the luxury to move away just as they once had the luxury to choose to move here that is people not pulled to one city or another by family obligation or job transferral but rather by some grander idea of who they are and where they might best fit

8344922 ini adalah perbuatan sebagian binatang seperti anjing dan kita punya dasar umum bahwa dalam banyak hadits ar rasul melarang untuk tasyabbuh menyerupai hewan hewan seperti larangan beliau turun sujud seperti turunnya onta dan menoleh seperti tolehan srigala dan mematuk seperti patukan burung gagak dan telah dimaklumi pula bahwa nabi shallallahu alahi wa sallam telah melarang untuk tasyabbuh dengan orang kafir maka diambil juga dari makna larangan tersebut pelarangan tasyabbuh dengan hewan hewan sebagai penguat yang telah lalu apalagi hewan yang telah dlketahui kejelekan tabiatnya maka seharusnya seorang muslim dan keadaannya seperti ini merasa tinggi untuk menyerupai hewan hewan
8344923 ini adalah haram karena is termasuk tasyabbuh dengan hewan hewan namun banyak di kalangan kaum muslimin yang tertimpa oleh perkara perkara yang rendah lagi ganjil menurut syariat akal dan fitrah seperti ini hal tersebut karena ia menghabiskan waktunya untuk mengikuti rangkaian film film porno melalui video atau televisi yang rusak seorang lelaki muslim berkewajiban untuk menghormati istrinya dan jangan ia berhubungan dengannya kecuali sesuai dengan perintah allah kalau ia berhubungan dengannya selain dari tempat yang allah halalkan baginya maka tergolong melampaui batas dan bermaksiat kepada allah dan rasul nya shallallahu alahi wa sallam

8344999 look lets try it if we dont come right nico will have to help us if i dont hear from you again the plan is to meet at nicos place
8345000 we need to see the guys in the next 5 minutes or theyre not going to make it
8345001 you know its odd if we didnt have that flat tyre last night there is no way we would have made it to willowmore in time today i would have had to have unpacked all the bikes and figured out where all the equipment was because of the flat last night everything was available for a quick change this morning so you know in a way we were lucky
8345002 nope you used up all our bad luck thanks how was your drive
8345003 no we were singing songs we met all sorts of people and i took some great photos it was a long trip but we had a great time
8345004 the sale is a great business decision we are delighted we look forward to expanding the brand even further to chicago and tokyo
8345005 whats wrong with the presence of bah s in egypt and giving them full rights to practice their religion
8345006 bah s have been here in the country for the past thirty 30 years and no one paid them any attention
8345007 if the one thousand 1000 bah s living in egypt expressed their religion in a peaceful manner and without proselytising would this ruffle public serenity and would this impinge on the strength of isl m
8345008 if a muslim converts to christianity to hell with him
8345009 this story is not true luke is not appearing on the show
8345010 they had no right to use his name or photo he is not the spokesperson
8345011 i expect this campaign to continue to build steam right through the general election
8345012 we have already seen attempts to buy this senate seat by outsiders who do not represent the best interest of alaska we will combat this special interest influence by continuing to recruit more supporters attract more alaskan contributors and establish the biggest grassroots network this state has ever seen
8345013 i think its extremely highly probable and im not a democratic pollster
8345014 the undercurrent is that people feel theyre ready for change
8345015 the rhetoric theyve been handed for too long has not helped at all
8345016 as part of that tradition i am here today to release you
8345017 want the chance to vote whats in your heart still others will be voting for sen obama because they want to demonstrate their personal commitment to unity of this party behind our nominee so i am not telling you what to do
8345018 but a lot of other people who are signing their ballots have made a different choice what is so important is that at the end of today we will nominate barack obama and joe biden for the president and vice president of the united states
8345019 a president who has the judgment to use war as a last resort not a first resort
8345020 obama will be a president who can adapt to new situations as things change
8345021 you know theres an old saying if you do what you always did youll get what youve always got america needs new leadership in the white house and that leader is barack obama
8345022 it is my distinct honor as an iraq war veteran as a lifelong republican and as a proud citizen of this democracy to nominate the next president of the united states barack obama
8345023 i stand with hillary as she stands with barack obama to take our country back
8345024 on behalf of all women and all working families i have the great honor to nominate hillary rodham clinton my friend our champion for the presidency of america
8345025 ive heard so many great things about tel aviv and israel but hearing is one thing and experiencing it for yourself is another
8345026 today i raced for the last time in my usa national champion kit its been a honor to wear the stars and stripes and win a medal for my home country but this year ive decided to focus on the tour of spain which has been a major team goal since early in the season
8345027 it was nice for me to race on my training circuit in the madrilene sierra im feeling good and am very happy to see that my teammates are in good condition as well we are excited to start the last grand tour of the season on saturday
8345028 in the brief time he held his position we spoke almost daily he learned so much and did so much to make arab americans and american muslims feel included in the campaign

8345030 manji is a fresh new and intriguing voice of islamic reform

8345032 americans having been more harmed by americans than non americans
8345033 mazen asbahi has just resigned i cant say im disheartened hed been embraced by groups like the muslim public affairs council and the islamic society of north america renowned for their conservative politics and moderate double speak

8345037 the concern is that future dividend requirements could reduce statutory capital to a level inconsistent with the rating category
8345038 its had a pretty terrible run for a longtime now
8345039 so its not completely unexpected that its going to continue to go down because its struggling in many facets of the business

8345041 and dont skip out on them this is a federal offense and the fbi will come after you if you dont pay it
8345042 in fact they were coming up to me to hear the music and the 100 they tossed into my guitar case is testimony to the fact that they liked what i was doing that isnt panhandling and in any case its pretty nasty to fine someone 500 when hes doing something because he needs money

8345057 the question most americans want answered about iraq is this when will our troops come home we already know the likely answer in 2006 they will begin to leave in large numbers in 2007 a significant number of the remaining 100 000 will follow we cannot sustain 150 000 americans in iraq without extending deployment times even if we could our large military presence while still the only guarantor against total breakdown is increasingly counterproductive
8345058 voted for the iraq war in 2002 but became a vocal critic
8345059 no strategy for success in iraq his plan is to muddle through and hand the problem off to his successor
8345060 as long as there is a single troop in iraq i know if i take action by funding them i increase the prospect they will live or not be injured i cannot and will not vote no to fund them
8345061 the hard truth is that our large military presence in iraq is necessary they are the only guarantor against chaos pulling out prematurely or setting a deadline divorced from progress in the areas ive discussed throughout the country will doom us
8345062 authorize d the president to continue participation by u s armed forces in multi national force iraq

8345068 this potentially calls into question the ability of the bank to renew or raise additional brokered deposits and ultimately could impact overall liquidity as well calling into question the potential viability of the franchise in our view
8345069 while the bank may yet be successful in finding private equity capital to forestall additional regulatory sanctions we believe there is a good enough chance that this will not come to pass and therefore see the potential for further price degradation

8345083 i like to talk about trophies that is the main thing but the champions league is also about money and you have to take the two things together but we are here to win titles not to make money
8345084 i always tell my players that if they win games they win trophies and then they will have higher wages and more money we need to win silverware so we will be better in all of these areas
8345085 do our finances in any way depend on getting through no i dont think so it is not about money it is about winning
8345086 newcastle united can confirm that it has received a written transfer request from james milner
8345087 the club is very disappointed that james sees his footballing future as being away from st james park he is a valued member of the squad and it is only a year ago that he signed an improved long term contract
8345088 we have yet to receive an offer for james that has matched our valuation of him however should such an offer be received then the club would be reluctantly forced to consider it given james apparent desire to leave
8345089 it comes from within i feel we can advance if we handle the stress we must start the match believing we can do it and we have to channel this belief in our game
8345090 with the help of our fans we can get the result that will take us into the group stage
8345091 we must be patient and hopefully well be luckier than two weeks ago in cyprus
8345092 we may have won the first game 3 0 but we have a really tough second leg ahead
8345093 obviously our lead is healthy but we need to work even harder if we want to get to the group stage i want those who take the field against olympiacos to use all their strength to achieve our ultimate dream were close but the game that stands in our way is very tough

8345096 here rests in honored glory an american soldier known but to god
8345097 the overall appearance of the memorial is not what it should be and we know this is a problem
8345098 a replica is not the same thing as the original
8345099 the cracks continue to grow and i cant predict what the weather is going to continue to do to the monument
8345100 cemetery officials heard our concerns and were not very receptive to changing their plans
8345101 if they were to replace the monument with the same marble material it would eventually start cracking again
8345102 for now we will intermittently repair the monument with grouting process that should hold for several years at a time
8345103 cracks cannot be repaired indefinitely without the monument acquiring a patched worn and shabby appearance which is the antithesis of its purpose and contrary to arlington national cemeterys mission of maintaining a dignified fitting memorial to our countrys fallen soldiers
8345104 i worry that as the cracks worsen it will eventually take away from the visitors experience

8345111 very seriously and now they are going to pay them back
8345112 this is nothing but pure political hate propaganda against the christians when the root problem is of course caste oppression
8345113 he was doing a good job of propagating the bright points of hinduism and the missionaries were not able to convert the tribal people as effectively as they were doing previously
8345114 the rest of what happened is something the government needs to investigate and tell the people of india
8345115 i would say the violence is seven times worse than in december
8345116 i mean the government is trying its best but its like a mad frenzy they are just destroying everything

8345141 i want to end the mindset that got us into war in the first place
8345142 if this statement is to be taken seriously it would mean a paradigm shift in u s foreign policy away from militarism towards diplomacy foreign aid and cooperation with other nations it will also mean shrinking the already too large defense budget creating the ability to invest in the new energy economy u s infrastructure and the basic necessities of the american people the vast majority of americans a growing super majority opposes continuing keeping u s troops in iraq bombing iran and wants a less military based foreign policy now is the time for greater emphasis on negotiation diplomacy multilateralism and foreign aid the people demand it war is not the answer to any of these conflicts the u s is not made more secure by creating new enemies and draining our treasury

8345222 the popular decoupling theory that the rest of the worlds economies can continue to thrive while the u s economy slows has proven to be bunk as it turns out other global economies not the u s are flirting with recession

8345226 id rather break the law than live with injustice my whole life
8345227 yang jias abnormal behavior is a measure of abnormality in our own society
8345228 some raised the issue of why he did it so this got into bigger issue of maybe there were injustices carried out by the shanghai police
8345229 thats where i think authorities would not want this case to go
8345230 yesterday i wrote one about why the shanghai court didnt put the notice of the trials schedule on its web site which the law says they should do three days in advance
8345231 a jury was able to see that and come to the correct verdict
8345232 we thought there was certainly enough evidence to convict this person of this crime the jury chose to ignore it
8345233 im not saying its a conspiracy but you know what it certainly gives pause and gives a motive
8345234 the proof that terrorist groups are cornered by our security forces

8345237 very little academic material exists on ict service management best practice
8345238 research site was a large service unit of ict in a provincial government in south africa during 2002 3
8345239 we can rather safely conclude that the number of problems logged would be a good reflection of objective service levels
8345240 did you observe the expected roi base 20 european firms no 50 dont know 30 yes 20
8345241 some helpdesks can way outperform a site that has adopted the best practices of itil
8345242 best practice does not mean superior performance it is beginning to sound that itil is the only way to go it isnt it is only one way to go
8345243 there is nothing else quite like itil it is not a methodology per se it is just advice and guidance itil is not based on scientific theory it is documented best practice itil is widely used because it is commonsense but it is not a bible that should be followed blindly

8345245 if it were all limited to research with ironclad causality determined the amount of scientific research published would drop dramatically furthermore pure deduction really only comes into play in math philosophy and other such deterministic endeavors the softer the science the more controversial the deductive reasoning to the point where in fields like the social sciences causality is almost impossible to rigorously prove
8345246 i have just completed a thorough statistical examination of the life of president bush for fifty eight years close to 21 000 observations he did not die once i can hence pronounce him as immortal with a high degree of statistical significance
8345247 not sure why you think i am confusing correlation with induction
8345248 what started this all was your implication that inductive reasoning is somehow suspect
8345249 i have determined in my recent conversations with real scientists
8345250 surely if itpis efforts are so impoverished and misguided and doing credible research is so simple and straightforward there must be solid examples somewhere that one of you can point to
8345251 lysenko was a self promoting peasant who it was said solved the problem of fertilizing the fields without fertilizers and minerals lysenkos methods never faced a rigorous test
8345252 lysenko was especially skillful at denouncing this opponents he used questionnaires from farmers to prove that his methods increased crop yields and thus avoided any direct tests
8345253 lysenko and his theories dominated russian biology the result was famines that killed millions and purges that sent hundreds of dissenting soviet scientists to the gulags or the firing squads lysenko was aggressive in attacking genetics which was finally banned there was never any basis for lysenkos ideas yet he controlled soviet research for thirty years lysenkoism ended in the 1960s but russian biology still has not entirely recovered from that era
8345254 itpis regression analysis only gives the study the illusion of credibility lipstick on the pig
8345255 we started with interviews of 11 organizations recognized for their data center operational excellence
8345256 interview data collection and analysis proceeded iteratively with early interviews being more open ended and later interviews being directed by five emerging themes of common practice
8345257 we also asked about key measures they used to gauge success in these areas
8345258 which of the following best describes your definition of change success rate
8345259 the survey responses are defining change success how is confirmation bias kept from contaminating the data

8345446 considering the train did derail and depending on the volume of passengers that could have been on the train and if it were a different time of day things could have been substantially worse
8345447 the driver as well as a patient we took sustained the brunt of the collision because it was at the front of the train but even he is in stable condition at this point in time
8345448 all i can say at this point is there was a miscommunication as to whether or not the boom was supposed to be over the track when the train hit it
8345449 i would say its unlikely that there will be any criminal charges from the police end i imagine it would be something that occupational health and safety and their own departments look at as far as the people involved will be dealt with
8345450 they had requested a lane closure which is also deemed a signal lockout and that was authorized for 10 30 a m
8345451 if you look at the distance from where the boom is which is where contact was made and where the train stopped you can see how fast it was going
8345452 the train is travelling about 80 kilometres an hour so we can see it was quite an abrupt halt
8345453 cest une nouvelle fantastique il y avait beaucoup de rumeurs quant un ventuel d part de cadel vers une autre quipe mais je suis heureux de pouvoir nouveau compter sur lui jusquen 2010

8345455 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel
8345456 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat
8345457 terrorism destroying israel those arent serious threats obama dangerously unprepared to be president
8345458 now that has to be the kind of approach that we take you know iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serio us threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance and we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen that doesnt mean we agree with them on everything we might not compromise on any issues but at least we should find out are there areas of potential common interest and we can reduce some of the tensions that has caused us so many problems around the world

8345484 time for franken to admit he wants to take away secret ballot says coleman campaign
8345485 now he wants to violate workers rights even further by taking away their rights to a secret ballot al franken says a lot of things in this campaign most of them not believable but this time he has a chance to do the right thing
8345486 taxes health care the war certainly those are some of the more obvious contenders to be marquee issues in minnesotas hard fought senate race but what has surprisingly emerged to dominate the air waves and the debate is a bill that was passed by the u s house but bogged down in the senate more than a year ago the employee free choice act its innocuous name belies the furor raging over it in minnesota and across the nation among the bills key provisions it would allow unions to be recognized without a secret ballot and would stiffen penalties for employers who retaliate against prounion employees
8345487 franken spokesman andy barr said that franken a member of four labor unions is proud to support the employee free choice act which is also known as the card check bill efca doesnt take away a workers right to a secret ballot it prevents the corporations who bankroll norm colemans campaign from intimidating workers barr said
8345488 dfl senate candidate al franken owes a 25 000 penalty to the new york state workers compensation board for failing to carry workers compensation insurance for employees of his namesake corporation from 2002 to 2005 state officials said new york officials have made numerous attempts to contact franken about the matter since april 2005 but have gotten no reply
8345489 franken has been tidying up a little mess of his own word came tuesday that he has paid an additional 832 in penalties to new york state for failing to provide disability benefits for employees of his private corporation earlier franken was found to owe a 25 000 penalty for failing to provide workers compensation to employees of alan franken inc for two years on tuesday minnesota republican party officials released documents showing franken quietly paid the additional 832 in fines related to disability coverage earlier this month
8345490 franken a comedian and author and his wife franni set up alan franken inc in new york in 1991 to handle fees and residuals for his services the frankens moved from manhattan to minneapolis in late 2005 minnesota records show that the corporation has paid workers compensation insurance since it moved to the state with the frankens more than two years ago mcintosh said the frankens never received the nearly one dozen notices that new york officials had sent them since april 2005
8345491 2nd senate candidate failed to insure staff for workers comp
8345492 he should reject his position of supporting legislation that would steal workers rights to a secret ballot
8345493 situationen er helt anderledes i tilf ldet roskilde bank hvis man skulle pege p en skyldig i denne situation er det ikke finansministeren eller hans ministerium men derimod finanstilsynet de har sovet i timen de burde have v ret opm rksomme p dette det er dem der har et forklaringsproblem
8345494 finanstilsynet har pligt til at holde je med udviklingen og for at de kan g re deres arbejde har de ret vide bef jelser til at gribe ind de kan p et hvilket som helst tidspunkt foretage et uanmeldt kasseeftersyn ja det har de faktisk pligt til men det har de ikke gjort i denne situation det er det sv rt at finde en forklaring p bortset fra manglende overblik og indsigt
8345495 det kan sende det meget uheldige signal at andre banker dersom de kommer i krise tager let p situationen fordi de ved at staten i sidste ende vil betale regningen
8345496 der kan selvf lgelig v re s rlige forhold i danmark men som grundregel er der sund fornuft i at gribe ind alternativet er at der opst r tvivl om hele finanssektoren og at folk begynder at st i k for at f deres sparepenge igen p den m de kan der ske en slags nedsmeltning af hele banksektoren via en slags dominoeffekt og en s dan vil undergrave hele samfunds konomien
8345497 nej den k ber jeg ikke banker er der for at tjene penge ingen bank nsker at blive overtaget af det offentlige p den m de mister aktion rerne deres penge og de verste ansatte i banken g r ikke just reklame for deres kompetence staten har en oplagt rolle i en s dan situation alternativet er at der tabes rigtig store penge og det kommer vi i sidste ende alle til at betale for
8345498 sidste gang hvor en bank var ude i en lige s alvorlig krise var helt tilbage i 1959 men dengang greb viggo kampmanns socialdemokratiske regering ikke ind de lod banken g fallit og dermed st som en skamst tte for den forfejlede politik
8345499 generelt har det v ret s dan i danmark at man har ladet kr fternes frie spil r de p den m de adskiller vi os fra andre lande som f eks storbritannien
8345500 siden 1923 har nationalbanken holdt sig v k vi skal helt tilbage til landmandsbankens krak i begyndelsen af 1920erne for at finde en tilsvarende situation men det er sv rt at sammenligne den situation med den nuv rende dengang blev investeringer d kket ind af indflydelsesrige folk i banken det var direkte ulovligt
8345501 roskilde bank har haft en alt for lemf ldig l nepolitik og at finanstilsynet ikke har v ret opm rksomt p problemet det er det sidste der b r f konsekvenser

8345522 this new building is symbolic in a couple of ways

8345537 unfortunately the singer and jimmy page are absolutely not famous enough to be known or recognized by millions of the chinese audiences as for david beckham he was supposed to kick the football towards the red circle in the center of the birds nest in the end just like any of his penalties at a football match he totally missed it he kicked the ball to the left and dropped in the crowd then was picked up by a lucky chinese volunteer who would not let go of the ball

8345548 the appeal of stone soup is that this deep area may collect and concentrate different kinds of materials
8345549 the trough between polygons is sort of a trap where things can accumulate
8345550 over a long timescale there may even be circulation of material sinking at the margins and rising at the center
8345551 we had a shootout between stone soup and white stuff in a trench called upper cupboard
8345552 if we had been able to confirm that the white material was a salt rich deposit we would have analyzed that but we were unable to confirm that with various methods
8345553 whether the brightest galaxies in clusters grew substantially in the last few billion years is intensely debated our observations show that in this time these galaxies have increased their mass by 50 percent

8345569 its a neat thing for the team to experience together
8345570 i want them to know about all these different stories and know whats going on around them socioeconomically it opens their eyes for me the players get more out of it than they give as far as being aware of all the things they have these experiences stick with them and once they get into the real world they will be socially conscious and have an awareness to help others not as fortunate
8345571 everyone is caught up in their own lives the people that were there dont have much but appreciated us just being there which makes us appreciate everything we have it opened our eyes not to take anything for granted

8345644 i love eve online and actually for me personally i actually think its a better game

8345646 the us computer emergency readiness team cert has issued a warning for what it calls active attacks against linux based computing infrastructures using compromised ssh keys
8345647 entirely a website business there were not many newspapers there
8345648 the chicago sun times had the best sports section in the city before jay mariotti came to town thats why he signed up with us and his departure does not change that
8345649 just think about this in four months we will have an administration that actually believes in science
8345650 as far as we know these are the most dark matter dominated galaxies in the universe
8345651 this implies that we are approaching the scale at which the properties of the elementary particles which presumably make up the dark matter are producing observable astrophysical effects
8345652 this was why god put the ticket in his hands
8345653 the use of the term fijian is deeply embedded in the fijian psyche since the time of contact with the missionaries traders and colonial administrators and has been used in the deed of cession 1970 1990 and 1997 constitutions to refer to the first people of this country or taukei
8345654 it also defines entitlement to land and other resources both land and sea and is a marker for people who share a common language and culture knowledge systems and world views any attempt to use the word to refer to all citizens of this country is a gross violation of what the term stands for including its spiritual cultural and social significance to the fijian people
8345655 it also runs counter to the provisions of the un declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples which recognises the rights of indigenous people to self governance and self determination
8345656 we are concerned at the attempt by the interim administration to weaken fijian institutions through the establishment of committees or taskforces to restructure various fijian institutions
8345657 we are concerned that this has been done through the exploitation of the office of the president the holder of which is a chief such an act in fijian custom is an insult in terms of fijian protocol and tovo vakaturaga and vakavanua
8345658 we see it as an insult not only to the holder of the office of the president but to all chiefs and fijian people
8345659 it is therefore important that the vanua which has been quiet all this time raise their voice this is the time to make our position known on these issues
8345660 we as chiefs have to make our decisions known and it is a bold decision we have taken given the situation we are in now
8345661 and all of this occurred because some members of the fiji police force took the misguided view they had the right to detain as they wished a suspect for up to 48 hours under the constitution
8345662 the case is one which says much about a complete misunderstanding by certain law enforcements officers in this country as to their powers of arrest detention and search
8345663 investigating officer was asking me about the incident he said i am in the soup now and since he was the investigating officer he was able to twist the interview
8345664 he told me to say that my boyfriend did it
8345665 the term fijian refers to legal ownership of land and other assets
8345666 it would be more responsible if the ncbbf had instead recommended for more frank and good faith negotiation with the fijian community on the matter of a common name
8345667 beginning with our colonial legacy of divide and rule and the institutionalisation of communal identities our people have tended to identify more strongly with their religions ethnicity and by their various communities or provinces than by nationality
8345668 people are only here because they want answers on the power and water supply projects
8345669 we have 10 computers at the school and we are using a generator but it is not strong enough to power the computers so the students are not able to use them
8345670 we have two suspected cases but we have to have the blood confirmation
8345671 we raised a dengue alert last week because there was an alert in samoa following the alert in kiribati
8345672 we have stepped up control measures at the airport and local areas of awareness
8345673 following the alert and suspected cases we have begun awareness in the west
8345674 to be proactive we are doing localised pocket spraying where those two cases came from
8345675 they have been saying the draft charter is going to be good for the people and so i feel there is no harm to come and at least listen to them said ms nisha
8345676 we cannot run the blood services alone and we will need help from the public we rely on their generosity in order to continue with this service
8345677 after spending 10 days here they went for a break to natadola
8345678 but after they saved the brother they came ashore and thought that father toma was going to come later
8345679 he didnt call for help and they thought that he was just spending time on his own they didnt know he was drowning
8345680 he reminded me of the welfare of the parishioners and told me that we must hold the fort while he was gone
8345681 i didnt know that was going to be the last time i spoke to him
8345682 you come in today representing the northern division society i stand before you representing the 55 prisoners of this facility
8345683 we seek your forgiveness for the wrongs and the hurts that we have perpetrated against you
8345684 my passion is to see young people become empowered in using their god given talents and abilities to help make the world a better place
8345685 growing up for 13 years in papua new guinea and coming from a multi cultural background as you can see i am of korean descent i developed a deep interest in the global community and its diverse languages and culture the richness of the fijian and indian cultures fascinated and brought me to fiji
8345686 i know that people in wainikoro have been facing immense expenses and difficulties in transporting the bodies of their loved ones to and from the labasa hospital
8345687 while the clean supply is coming it takes about two to three days to be ready
8345688 the only way it affects us is through the cost of fuel and the overtime cost
8345689 on friday about 8pm an off duty police officer came to my place at sikituru with a friend of mine
8345690 they said a report had been lodged at nadi police station by my former employer who alleged i stole his watch and gold chain
8345691 after they took me to the cell and kept me there from until monday
8345692 i cannot stand up straight and when i move my body is sore i dont know why i was kept in the cell and not charged my back is swollen
8345693 he has cuts and bruises on his face hands and back
8345694 we are going to try to get rid of the section
8345695 we are trying to look for expressions of interest to handle dredging and draining
8345696 there is a need to remove the confusion and segregate the functions of the commission and the secretariat the separation of the role of the commission from the public service is necessary to preserve and protect its independence and assign the functional role of the permanent secretary to the public service
8345697 it is therefore important to increase the grant to 15 000 for it to be meaningful particularly to new farmers in meeting relevant costs
8345698 the union further calls on the shareholders to send the senior management on indefinite leave and appoint a new management to look after the operation while an inquiry is made into the state of affairs in the company
8345699 the mess the company is in has been created by senior management themselves
8345700 they were living on our land promised they would pay some lease but kept delaying it
8345701 one day i got mad and spilt kerosene in front of the house i did not burn it
8345702 the attitude of the wardens too has changed so its encouraging and makes us think about what we are doing with our lives
8345703 we are looking at training and counselling for women prisoners with the assistance of the department and ngos
8345704 the department of women realises that rehabilitating and giving a second chance is a huge task especially the monitoring side of the exercise
8345705 the yellow ribbon is to protect prisoners there is a need for us to support them because no one is perfect most deserve a second chance
8345706 i support the yellow ribbon effect because it is about giving second chance to shoeshine boys we all are human beings and we all have weaknesses the best rehabilitation program we can give them is our support and we can also pray for god to change them
8345707 the yellow ribbon is about initiating rehabilitation for prisoners to give them a better life they have paid for their crimes and as christians we should be forgiving
8345708 i support the yellow ribbon that looks into the plight of ex prisoners we all make mistakes and my advice is to never look at the past one should always strive forward counseling i believe is the best way to provide them with the help they need
8345709 we are supporting this and the rehabilitation programs the prisons department has and we would like to work in partnership with them
8345710 the prisons are close to the hospital and we look after prisoners from korovou naboro and nasinu prisons
8345711 we pay monthly visits to the korovou prison and the prisoners are sometimes escorted here if they are sick
8345712 we had a very poor support but we will still go ahead with the festival
8345713 we would love to have the contestants but we cant
8345714 we still very much look forward to our long awaited time off with our families thus will not be playing any other dates until next year thanks again for all of your continued support

8345717 i like the way that we got some rhythm and fluency to our play
8345718 the clean sheet was a good confidence booster for the whole club weve scored nine goals and were looking to play with flair and rhythm
8345719 the two performances against oldham and yeovil were not quite up to the standard were trying to set here i always had it in mind to make a few changes and play a slightly different formation
8345720 as much as there was no panic after the last two performances im not going to go overboard with this as it is still very early in the season and people are trying to find their form
8345721 im asking people to step up to the plate and when they get their chance to go and take it ive got to say that from one to 11 tonight they all performed
8345722 it shows that we have a very strong squad of players here and competition brings out the quality in people
8345723 i thought luciano led the line fantastically and that some of the combinations in the middle of the park and some of the movement in the final third was excellent
8345724 weve got an important run of games here at elland road home now and were looking to come out of it with no defeats
8345725 its just a short term contract to begin with but hopefully i can earn myself a longer one its down to me to perform whenever im called upon and make sure that i train correctly as well
8345726 i have had a very long career and in the latter stages of it i would like to be playing for a team that is successful and trying to do well and ive got that in a nutshell here at leicester city
8345727 were under no illusions as to how tough it will be this year but if we can get the right balance the signs are positive
8345728 id like to give this victory to the fans who have been tremendous since that memorable day back in 2003 when we beat hull at the vetch field to secure our football league status
8345729 i know there were a lot of changes on both sides but it still shows how far weve come as a football club when we can compete and beat a premier league side
8345730 in the first half you could see why hull are a premier league side perhaps we showed them a bit too much respect and were a bit cagey
8345731 but from the start of the second half i thought we controlled the game and looked the stronger side as the game went on the quality we showed was fantastic
8345732 the extra time winner rounded off a perfect night of cup football and i hope the fans enjoyed that display

8345747 we are not discouraging players from speaking other languages they can talk to their caddie in whatever language they choose they can speak to other players on the driving range in whatever language they choose if theyre brazilian and a reporter asks them a question in portuguese by all means answer it in portuguese and were not demanding that the players be perfectly fluent in english what were saying is that the ability to speak to your pro am partners and to the media and for the winner to give their victory speech in english will be one of our tournament regulations
8345748 we confirm that we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar

8345756 in terms of his speech obama has got to do two things he has to rally his base and he has to reach out to independent voters
8345757 to get people focused on the economy because that is the area of his strength but he also has to reassure people in the areas where they are not as confident of him
8345758 this democratic convention has a vibe so weird and jittery so at odds with the early thrilling fairy dust feel of the obama revolution
8345759 i couldnt understand why he would organise a convention to give the clintons two nights and then diss hillary as vice president

8345766 weve seen some of the impact but come oct 1 it will pick up by no means with the fourth quarter be bad
8345767 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8345768 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8345769 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8345770 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8345771 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8345772 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware

8345793 tenemos respeto hacia ellos porque est n aqu por la misma raz n que estamos nosotros el primer partido es quiz s el mas importante porque si ganas pones presi n al otro equipo durante el segundo partido
8345794 si jugamos con la intensidad correcta tendremos un buen resultado
8345795 esperamos que ellos sean un poco conservadores y organizados enfrente de su propia porter a tendremos que ponerlos bajo presi n y ser agresivos para provocar cosas y convertir nuestras opciones de gol
8345796 este es un gran duelo para mi para mis compa eros y el club ya que pondremos un sello en la historia del club subiendo hacia un torneo mayor
8345797 por primera vez un equipo canadiense jugar en este torneo as que representar a montreal es un gran compromiso
8345798 esto es como una semifinal la diferencia es que tenemos una semana entre ambos partidos y no conocemos al equipo al que enfrentamos como los equipos que enfrentamos en nuestra propia liga dijo el mediocampista sandro grande asi que tendremos que pensar acerca de nosotros mismos y jugar como lo hicimos en los ltimos dos partidos y entonces nos ajustaremos sobre la cancha a lo que ellos hagan
8345799 es una gran oportunidad para el impact y para los fan ticos del f tbol ver equipos que no est n acostumbrados a ver

8345811 slow strengthening is forecast once gustav moves away from haiti and the storm could regain hurricane strength within the next day or two
8345812 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the gulf coast region to listen to what their local officials are advising over the course of the next few days and to take these simple steps to prepare
8345813 if residents make individual and family preparations they make it easier for first responders to focus on people who cant help themselves and need help first
8345814 as long as there is a chance that well be in this storm ill be here in louisiana
8345815 im going to make sure im here personally to lead the preparation efforts and if necessary any recovery efforts necessary after the fact

8345820 you definitely have to do something to put yourself out there to get their attention but dont be that girl
8345821 he is going to notice you its just like when a guy walks into a bar and you see a bunch of girls you know right off the bat five of them that you know are hot and you really really want to talk to
8345822 youre going to remember those five i promise the other ones its going to take a little bit but you know once you remember them it works
8345823 we paid upfront because they were offering a slight discount if you paid upfront we were selling two houses at the time so we thought it was a good idea
8345824 i have been in contact with the post office and they have promised to do their best to attend this meeting and explain their position having lost the facility on st albans avenue and henrietta street it is vital this post office remains open to serve local businesses and residents
8345825 it is clear from what people have told us that this is a very busy post office offering an excellent range of services and very much valued by people in the broadoak area and beyond post office limited have made a huge mistake in proposing to close this post office it is also important to note that although this meeting is in early september the consultation runs until 7 october so people still have time to sign the petition or better still send us a letter to support the campaign
8345826 youre so lucky that you live in the us i come from country x where theres no culture of philanthropy so we cant raise money

8345832 ricky wants the brand to represent not only style and performance but also for quality and value for money
8345833 we thought wed be able to get the purchase price of the house back but we can only get the cost of the wall back which is 15 000 16 000 thats not even a quarter of the price of the house
8345834 theres no point us doing it because if we couldve got the purchase price we couldve negotiated with the mortgage provider

8345851 it could have been a dog movie or an outer space movie we just kind of landed on a spy movie
8345852 its really a funny script i didnt feel any need to wander off the script

8345950 we all loved sports and that gave us a closeness that lasts until this day
8345951 at uh home games ron and cal dont need to scan the stands to know where their parents are they know that long before the rest of the crowd arrive their father thomas slowed but not stopped by arthritis will have already wheeled himself to the south end zone where he and wife hazel will sit together until the last whistle they know also that their older brother two time zones away is also keeping track of their success
8345952 i always wanted my boys to play sports i didnt know that they would all coach but its what they love and theyve done well for themselves
8345953 it was love of sport thomas lee says from which the loving family grew unbeknownst to his mother who feared the injury the sometimes brutal game might inflict on her son thomas was an accomplished fullback by the time he reached his teen years with nothing but a thick sweatshirt to absorb the contact thomas played with a selflessness he learned by his mother a widow who worked long hours at waimano home to pay her sons 9 a month tuition at saint louis and an intensity and intelligence he would eventually pass on to his young sons
8345954 i loved the game loved the contact i played until i couldnt run anymore
8345955 each weekend hazel would visit her hawaiian grandfather at his home on mokihana street it wasnt long before she noticed the group of young men who congregated down the street and in particular the athletic and personable one they called tom
8345956 my boys played everything football baseball basketball and my house was just like the park
8345957 everything we did was with each other it wasnt like one goes here and another goes there where you might have friends outside your family my brothers were my friends
8345958 that gave me a lot of time with my boys id run around with them all day and rest when i got to work i had no social life i was always with my boys
8345959 my husband and i really pushed our boys to get their diploma and go to college so they could get a good job we always checked who they were around and we pushed them to complete their education
8345960 my mother doesnt get much credit but she was right there with us in a silent way shed go to church every day to pray for our family whenever there was a game or an event she was the team mom she was our strength
8345961 tommy and ron followed their fathers footsteps to saint louis cal attended the recently opened kalani all three were excellent athletes particularly in football
8345962 he was ahead of his time even when we were losing he never said anything negative never blamed the coaches or the players i think if he had been negative i might have gone away from the game
8345963 to be honest i wasnt the best student i was at the bottom of the pack but i knew that i had to work hard academically to be able to play the great gift is that sports help you to attain goals that might not even realize are there at the time i hate to think where i would be now if i wasnt fortunate to have two loving parents to help me achieve that
8345964 tommy would go on to earn all america honors as a quarterback for willamette university in oregon ron and cal an all american at linebacker would also play for the school after stints in junior college
8345965 ron later took over the head coaching position at kaiser where cal joined him as an assistant together they led the cougars to four consecutive honolulu district titles and a prep bowl championship in 1979
8345966 it wasnt always easy and we werent always successful in the beginning but our parents were always there supporting us we didnt want to disappoint them my mom would come to games but she wouldnt watch shed be praying for us we never wanted to let her down
8345967 reunited cal and ron turned saint louis into a national powerhouse under the lees the crusaders would win 14 prep bowl titles 18 interscholastic league of honolulu championships and the inaugural hawaii high school athletic association state championship inspiring equal measures of respect fear and despondency throughout the local prep landscape the lee brothers success would continue with tommy coaching at portland state san antonios world league entry at montana western ron at oregon tech and saint louis and cal at st louis as athletic director and the hawaiian islanders arena football team
8345968 we pushed them so that they could one day get good jobs and live happy lives i didnt know that they would all be coaching but we dont mind because thats their passion and they are helping others
8345969 each sunday the lees attend church together at star of the sea then retire to zippys for their weekly family breakfast
8345970 weve been hanging out since we were kids and were still hanging out

8345974 this proposed regulation is about the legal right of a health care professional to practice according to their conscience
8345975 doctors and other health care providers should not be forced to choose between good professional standing and violating their conscience freedom of expression and action should not be surrendered upon the issuance of a health care degree
8345976 many health care providers routinely face pressure to change their medical practice often in direct opposition to their personal convictions
8345977 during my practice as an ob gyn i witnessed this first hand but health care providers shouldnt have to check their conscience at the hospital door this proposed rule will help ensure that doesnt happen

8346104 lo vi contento de haber tra do una medalla tiene ganas de jugar y es un jugador desequilibrante
8346105 arrancamos bien pero tuvimos una desconcentraci n y a partir de eso se arm otro partido
8346106 en el principio exist a la palabra y la palabra estaba junto a dios y la palabra era dios
8346107 de modo que la palabra vino a ser carne y residi entre nosotros y tuvimos una vista de su gloria gloria como la que pertenece a un hijo unig nito de parte de un padre y estaba lleno de bondad inmerecida y verdad

8346117 scott has been a partner with mauro gianettis team since the beginning in 2004
8346118 in all the past years the team could celebrate some remarkable victories we would like to thank the team for the cooperation in the past years and we wish the team and new sponsors all the best for the future
8346119 we were and remain convinced that the actions involved were those of individuals and not reflective of the team as a whole
8346120 the team wasnt invited the vuelta and its a spanish team
8346121 that indicates to us that they wont be riding in any of the three grand tours next year our sponsorship depends on working with a professional team that will be riding our bikes through the full uci aso schedule
8346122 particularly our carbon product has directly benefited from that sort of working relationship with a professional team and professional riders working with us to improve and refine our designs our approach is to cooperate with professionals at this point we dont have any strong belief that wed get the same benefit from our sponsorship next year
8346123 a better indication of where we are going in coming weeks
8346124 when i read something like this statement im most certain that the position for which the writing stands is anything but the only reasonably conclusion
8346125 hbo has paired with virgin america to rebrand the airlines flight from new yorks john f kennedy intl airport to las vegas as entourage air throughout september in addition to wrapping a virgin america plane with entourage signage the airline will screen the season premiere of the show on the vegas bound flight beginning sept 4 when the airline launches its direct route

8346127 he did it he tried to kill him he wasnt successful
8346128 there but for the grace of god is a murderer
8346129 you know that a crime was committed the question is who committed the crime
8346130 im not saying its a conspiracy but you know what it certainly gives pause and gives a motive
8346131 as soon as i read it i recognized it for what i felt it was which was an attack on patrons on identifiable patrons
8346132 in my book i turn the whole concept of compassion over
8346133 what is mean spirited letting someone who cant take care of children have them letting a pedophile and sex offenders come to your library
8346134 you cannot even broach the subject without someone saying oh shes a nazi
8346135 we realized later we missed the chance of course we are angry
8346136 we are decent and treat them well so we left we are not paparazzi
8346137 she was very angry by the sound of her voice
8346138 i got the impression she did not want to be hassled
8346139 i am so surprised to hear that question that is honestly the first time i have been asked that
8346140 i think were more likely to be running away from you
8346141 large scale exports of fresh water would be a wealth creating idea for quebec and for canada as a whole
8346142 it is urgent to look seriously at developing our blue gold
8346143 i think its absurd to suggest that you can potentially export such large quantities of water out of quebec for that not to have an environmental impact
8346144 expressed an interest in bulk water exports several years ago
8346145 by suggesting wealth generating reforms primarily on matters of taxation regulation health care and education
8346146 water clearly is a resource that is essential to life and turning it into a business may arouse fears that it could one day be overexploited
8346147 but these fears can be calmed if a legal and regulatory framework is established regardless of the fuss it is not necessary to prohibit trade in water

8346181 rubella is a common childhood infection usually with minimal systemic upset although transient arthropathy may occur in adults serious complications are very rare if it were not for the effects of transplacental infection on the developing foetus rubella is a relatively trivial infection
8346182 the disease can last one to five days children recover more quickly than adults infection of the mother by rubella virus during pregnancy can be serious if the mother is infected within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy the child may be born with congenital rubella syndrome crs which entails a range of serious incurable illnesses spontaneous abortion occurs in up to 20 of cases

8346187 avoiding pronouncing the tetragrammaton of the name of god on the part of the church has therefore its own grounds apart from a motive of a purely philogical order there is also that of remaining faithful to the churchs tradition from the beginning that the sacred tetragrammaton was never pronounced in the christian context nor translated into any of the languages into which the bible was translated

8346199 smart people believe weird things because they are skilled at defending beliefs they arrived at for non smart reasons
8346200 rarely do any of us sit down before a table of facts weigh them pro and con and choose the most logical and rational explanation regardless of what we previously believed most of us most of the time come to our beliefs for a variety of reasons having little to do with empirical evidence and logical reasoning
8346201 one problem with arguing for god through a series of logical definitions and syllogisms is the impossibility of finding spiritual or emotional comfort in such a rational process for most people god is not found in the sixth place after the decimal point
8346202 the four little pac man figures are turned at right angles to one another to create four false boundaries and a bright interior but there is no square in this figure the square is in our mind there appears to be something there when in actual fact there is nothing there as pattern seeking animals it is virtually impossible for us not to see the pattern the same may be true for god for most of us it is very difficult not to see a pattern of god when looking at the false boundaries and bright interiors of the universe do people see the pattern of god in the world and in their lives and therefore believe in god for perfectly rational reasons and if they do does that pattern represent something there or nothing there or are there other reasons people believe such as an emotional need a fear of death a hope for immortality an explanation for evil and suffering a foundation for morality parental upbringing cultural influence historical momentum and so on

8346236 hopefully im past the stage of justifying my ryder cup potential or otherwise everybody here and im sure that i speak for the captain as well understands my love for the ryder cup and thats how i will be remembered if you like
8346237 theres no resignation in any way shape or form i just felt i wanted to turn my game around and the best way to do that was practise up here and prepare the way that i have
8346238 im still five short but we will see thats what i was doing yesterday trying to find launch angles and all kind of fancy technical stuff that ive never been into before

8346273 this declaration is a call to action by and for all americans
8346274 the purpose of u s food and agriculture must change and it can no longer focus on the production of cheap calories conditions demand a more holistic approach to human and community health that begins on our farms and ranches
8346275 this declaration which is being crafted by a broad coalition is the preamble for the next generation of farm policy and we hope it will stimulate the discussion to help get us there
8346276 behind us stands a half century of industrial food production underwritten by cheap fossil fuels abundant land and water resources and a drive to maximize the global harvest of cheap calories

8346278 a spectre is haunting the cities and villages of most developing nations warns a senior official of a world bank affiliated organization
8346279 its the spectre of a food fuel and water crisis says lars thunell
8346280 keeping water under local public and democratic control is the most just way to insure the greatest degree of water access for the greatest number of people
8346281 the movement to create better food and agriculture in the u s has been slowly and steadily gaining ground for well over a decade
8346282 the publics increasing interest and the medias deepening coverage of climate change energy agriculture labor issues food costs food quality and obesity may finally illuminate the interrelationship of these crises and provide a context for urgently needed changes
8346283 confirmed that a tight cadre of lobbyists control the debate to protect the status quo rather than aid the population of the nation
8346284 for a radically different approach to food and agriculture we believe that the food system must be reorganized on a foundation of health

8346292 i hope georgian president mikheil saakashvili will not go down in history as a new gavrilo princip
8346293 what we may be witnessing is not just the end of the cold war or the passing of a particular period of post war history but the end of history as such that is the end point of mankinds ideological evolution and the universalization of western liberal democracy as the final form of human government
8346294 many people blame the georgian president they are wrong in part but there is also an element of truth to it he cant be accused of having acted illegally it was legal to move our forces into the south ossetian capital tskhinvali but it would have been better not to
8346295 on one side you have a bear and on the other a little roquet
8346296 but when youre a chief of state you have to know about the reality of forces this was an incredible misjudgment by saakashvili
8346297 signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of the independence of south ossetia and the independence of abkhazia
8346298 may have wider implications for security and stability in the caucasus
8346299 through our policy of neighborliness the european union must do all we can to support georgia and ukraine
8346300 we find this unacceptable it only adds to the difficulty of solving the conflict in south ossetia and abkhazia
8346301 we consider this a regrettable decision and i recall our attachment to the territorial integrity of georgia
8346302 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
8346303 has now chosen this route means they have chosen a policy of confrontation not only with the rest of europe but also with the international community in general
8346304 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives

8346314 antioxidant rich fruit and vegetables such as oranges carrots and broccoli can reduce the risk of diseases such as cancer of the larynx oesophagus cervix and lungs the study by edith cowan university nutritionists found that people who ate two serves of fruit and five serves of vegetables a day could cut their risk of developing a range of cancers heart and blood vessel disease metabolic syndrome and bone disease the researchers said while some of the protection against common diseases came from the weight loss associated with diets high in fruit and vegetables there was now good evidence that phytochemicals and vitamins such as a c and e in fresh produce had their own powerful antioxidant effects

8346335 this is the most significant decision in the history of the dietary supplements industry
8346336 it is a substantial departure from previous sentencing and sends a clear message to industry that transgressions of this nature will be harshly dealt with
8346337 there is nothing typical about this prosecution or the sentence imposed by the federal judge
8346338 first of all criminal prosecutions of those associated with dietary supplement companies are rare secondly it is even more rare for a criminal prosecution to occur based in whole or in part on allegations by the fda that an illegal structure function claim in the nature of actual fraud was made
8346339 if youre turning over 100m and you get slapped with a 10m fine it is not the end of the world but the court has ended warshaks world along with berkelys with this ruling and that is how it should be
8346340 if companies are not going to act as good citizens then they deserve to be punished and the court has done that today in no uncertain terms
8346341 this is not a first time speeding ticket for berkeley and that goes a long way to explaining the severity of the punishment multiple offenders who think they can continue sustaining slaps on the wrist via small fines warning letters and product recalls may be about to be hit with a rude awakening
8346342 his family and the people who work for him are also victims of his greed
8346343 if we are moving in the direction of a new cold war it will be harder to find a joint solution to problems such as the nuclear conflict with iran
8346344 of course cooperation on the iran issue could fall victim to the current confrontation between the united states and russia but this does not have to be the case
8346345 in past months the u s has moved away from unilateralism on this question and moved towards more multilateralism
8346346 it makes the enforcement of already ratified sanctions against tehran more challenging and significantly reduces the chances of consensus for the imposition of a fourth round of punitive sanctions against our nation
8346347 the downward spiral in relations between russia and the west will make it harder to work together on anything and iran policy heads the list of areas that are going to suffer
8346348 finding consensus on additional security council sanctions was hard to begin with
8346349 weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is to the wall
8346350 does not see an action against iran as the right thing to do at the moment
8346351 it will not become easier to lead a third war in the middle east just because one now also faces a conflict with russia
8346352 its no use denying theres a huge amount of tension in the relationship following the georgia intervention but there will be a lot of determination to keep the iran show on the road
8346353 everyone believes russia will no longer join u s pressure on iran
8346354 hostility to the war at home in the middle east and elsewhere in the world has had negative effects on the u s image and ability to galvanize the international community on any issue be it the iranian threat or even support for georgia
8346355 russia now has fewer reasons to cooperate with washington regarding irans nuclear program

8346362 coral reefs are at the heart of our tropics and millions of people around the world depend on these systems for their livelihoods without urgent action to limit carbon dioxide emissions and improve management of marine protected areas even vast treasured reefs like the great barrier reef and northwestern hawaiian islands will become wastelands of dead coral
8346363 the reefs of the world are at risk and are especially vulnerable to the rapidly emerging stress brought on by climate change
8346364 recognizing the potential irreversibility of ocean acidification impacts it has never been more imperative to improve the management and adaptability of coral reef ecosystems
8346365 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now
8346366 our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8346367 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8346368 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8346369 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8346370 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
8346371 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful
8346372 but they are not effective against global warming and in order to ensure the long term survival of this rich marine community that is what we need to address

8346391 web 2 0 brought all this dynamic information together with web based services that was cool for a while but
8346392 i am so surprised to hear that question that is honestly the first time i have been asked that
8346393 i think were more likely to be running away from you
8346394 looking at the parts we are playing im very concerned about what you think of us
8346395 like george im not sure if i should be flattered or insulted
8346396 have you seen the film and you call that a love letter
8346397 we started writing the movie as kind of an exercise thinking of what kind of parts these actors might play what kind of story they might inhabit
8346398 its really a funny script i didnt feel any need to wander off the script
8346399 he doesnt consider any other possibility other than what he thinks will happen i pretty much ran with that
8346400 theres something really really funny in terms of my character being so angry all the time

8346405 a horrible thing happened three years ago and we lived to tell the story but at this point most of us have taken the attitude that we are owed nothing no one is going to help and with that mindset we go on
8346406 so i hope i can count on you come next saturday this election is so important to the people of this city
8346407 so you can stop plotting to use that as an excuse the reason were not getting on has to do with your lack of commitment your lack of responsibility it was you who forced me to look elsewhere for someone who would make me feel worthwhile for someone entertaining
8346408 i wanted to share an experience with you thats all
8346409 fine share but dont be trying to turn things to your advantage with it you do that you take things that happen to you and carve them into biblical parables little gideonesque stories that you think prove that what you want to be true actually is even if everybody knows it isnt a guy that kills bugs for a living and he thinks hes a philosopher
8346410 i was having a long soak then i started to add more hot water and i looked up and there it was a snake climbing the frame of the lower bathroom window bright green a viper i sat up so quickly that the water sloshed from the tub all over the floor i was sure that the noise would make it notice me that it would draw the snake to me it did not not right then
8346411 i was frightened like a child dreaming of the bogey man i didnt know what to do but i had the urge to call out to yell for help
8346412 there was no one else in the apartment no one else to call out to
8346413 but there was if i wanted it thats what exploded into the vacuum left by the departure of fear thats what made me dizzy with a different sort of fright
8346414 yes all i had to do was decide that i was seeing a snake and it would be a snake there comes a time when everyone decides that his or her way of seeing the world is reality at that point you make a simple choice and life changes to suit a little thing like your affirming that a crickets song is really your lovers voice in the distance determines that you will be mad forever sets in stone that you will never get back to the state of sanity you possessed when you made that decision
8346415 sure they say they cure you that youre as good as new medicate you to the point where the voice becomes a cricket again and your life seems stable for the moment but once betrayed sanity is fickle ive researched this almost as extensively as i did my thesis like i told you the hemipterous thread legged bug emesa longipes
8346416 these are bugs that affect people live off them then leave something of their own presence behind in the bloodstreams of their hosts forever it never really goes away they were everywhere in the lunatic asylums even up into the middle of this century
8346417 along with the continuing emesa uh with the bug studies ive read a great deal about the onset of madness these last weeks the people who went insane say that they knew theyd never get back to the state of mind they held before they made their decision
8346418 once youve lost that first hold on reality once your own awareness trust is broken youre never sane again not like you were you can only hold the appearance of sanity and hope its good enough to get you through the machinations of the rest of your life you see dont you why i was so excited
8346419 i consciously chose to be sane this morning i could feel how easy it would be to simply say that is a snake and embrace the madness i even let my mind tempt the edges of the idea it was frightening how little it would have taken to go over but i didnt do it i was offered the choice and i decided on this world
8346420 it is once you are offered the opportunity once your mind says that you are ready to go either way then both doors are open and once you pass through they close behind you forever
8346421 are you saying you wait for some sort of basement sanity sale then go shopping for whats discounted as real
8346422 though i do love this with all your psychology i suppose youll find some freudian inconsistency in those two statements
8346423 why do you do things like that why do you always try to subvert anything i say with mindless nonsense this is important to me its about a loss of innocence as much as anything else a loss of trust

8346531 a pinch hit walk off hit would be absolutely amazing but in the cage they dont throw curveballs at you it was a good pitch against my approach which was to swing at anything and everything that was around the plate and i did that

8346554 esta vieja izquierda renunci a sus ambiciones de cambiar el mundo o la vida a fuerza de mostrarse incapaz de proponer otro camino ha vuelto poco a poco a reivindicar el regreso al statu quo esa etapa en que los empleos eran estables y las fronteras estaban cerradas
8346555 ninguna coalici n pol tica se ha construido sobre la base de una pol tica antiliberal todos los grandes partidos de izquierda han abrazado pol ticas reformistas m s favorables a las l gicas de mercado y m s dubitativas en cuanto a la eficacia de pol ticas puramente redistributivas dirigidas por el estado
8346556 cu nta ha sido la influencia del marxismo vulgar la identificaci n de la l gica econ mica como complot social la demonizaci n del adversario la veneraci n del estado el desprecio profundo a las experiencia extranjeras ha penetrado el conjunto de la izquierda que se ha visto sistem ticamente empobrecida
8346557 el cambio no es una necesidad inquietante sino una fuente de oportunidades ya que todo el problema est ah est en el cambio de perspectiva en pasar del pesimismo social de un marxismo superado a una visi n m s abierta y m s optimista del cambio social la izquierda no puede ser s lo el cartel de quienes tienen miedo a perder sus estatus para ello es necesario que la izquierda moderna tome el control despida a los responsables de su estancamiento durante decenios y empiece por fin a trabajar para encontrar un nuevo equilibrio
8346558 europa confronta el reto de la globalizaci n y como todos los dem s conglomerados debe tratar de alcanzar dos objetivos fundamentales aumentar su masa cr tica para poder influir en lo que acontece en el mundo frente a los estados unidos a china y en el futuro a la india y luego preservar sus preferencias colectivas es decir las opciones sociales colectivas que han logrado defender hasta ahora el equilibrio entre estado y mercado entre protecci n social y competencia econ mica entre los intereses de los asalariados el mundo del trabajo y los del capital
8346559 no es imposible que en el siglo xxi que es el siglo de la globalizaci n vuelva a darse un sistema que se conoci en el siglo xix la globalizaci n caracterizada por la competencia entre los estados grandes si prevalece esta l gica se opondr al gobierno mediante normas porque los estados grandes siempre se ver n tentados a tratar de arreglarse entre ellos mediante acuerdos a los que podr n renunciar cuando mejor les parezca en vez de sentirse obligados por compromisos internacionales limitantes y duraderos

8346573 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8346574 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges

8346609 you can have an integrated system with energy production carbon sequestration and due to the application of the charcoal agricultural benefits
8346610 its not clear whether these sites were created intentionally or whether they were just dumps
8346611 all the renewable energy options can provide energy thats carbon neutral and we need all of those things to get to a point where net emissions are low
8346612 but even then were probably going to have higher levels of atmospheric co2 than scientists recommend
8346613 if a farmer agrees to put ten tons of carbon into the field she gets ten carbon credits she can sell
8346614 it may be so beneficial you wouldnt need to pay her to use it

8346685 we started a massive search operation to rescue him but unfortunately the abductors killed him
8346686 police closed the circle on abductors that is why they left him there bleeding

8346701 if they dont have a plan you still have time if you wait until the storms on top of you thats when panics going to set in and you dont think wisely
8346702 although we have made strides in rebuilding our infrastructure the levees have not been fully repaired and we have an 800 million budget gap to complete our sewage and water systems
8346703 the citizens should not be worried about the flooding again

8346723 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8346724 this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win
8346725 good but not quite very good for barack obama in 2008 even better if things should turn out like they might for hillary clinton in 2012
8346726 what was missing was much in the way of description of barack obama what kind of man is he one who supports the same positions she does
8346727 has she looked deep into his heart and found something worthy no evidence here that she had would he be a good commander in chief not a word on that as the mccain campaign quickly and gleefully noted
8346728 the first time since 1976 that a convention has been more excited about a loser than a winner

8346740 el tema de los residuos en espa a est descontrolado el ministerio de medio ambiente ni siquiera centraliza la informaci n y son las grandes empresas las que se han hecho con el negocio de hacer desaparecer la basura por eso optan por incineradoras no por tratamientos espec ficos para reciclar
8346741 el problema es de partida en espa a el 90 de los residuos van a vertedero o incineradora no hay apoyo al reciclaje
8346742 y as nos va tratar la basura en origen es lo nico que solucionar a el problema los espa oles generan cada a o un 5 de residuos m s que el anterior mientras que el reciclaje lleva una d cada estancado por debajo del 10 as en 2008 nos encontramos con los vertederos colapsados normal
8346743 en europa de media el 28 de los residuos son incinerados dinamarca llega al 60 en espa a no pasamos del 7 por eso queremos construir entre 14 y 17 nuevas plantas en la pr xima d cada para llegar al menos al 20 de la basura generada
8346744 la incineraci n es sin duda la peor opci n para tratar los residuos
8346745 primero porque es la soluci n m s cara segundo porque en contra de lo que se dice no es una alternativa al vertedero el 30 de la basura que entra se convierte en cenizas t xicas que luego hay que llevar a vertederos especiales tercero porque a pesar de todos los avances tecnol gicos sigue emitiendo a la atm sfera part culas contaminantes y cuarto porque desincentiva el reciclaje las empresas incineradoras esperan de los ayuntamientos que les manden cuanta m s basura mejor porque se es su negocio
8346746 en realidad entre tirar la basura a un vertedero y quemarla en una incineradora no hay gran diferencia son soluciones finalistas una vez que nos desborda la basura lo resolvemos as buscando d nde meterla
8346747 se es el problema apostar por soluciones finalistas lo que hay que evitar es que se genere ese volumen de residuos tan alto con programas de concienciaci n ciudadana y mucha m s inversi n para la red de reciclaje poner dinero en ese trabajo previo no en construir plantas ni vertederos
8346748 pero son m s de 200 sustancias las que una planta de incineraci n emite a la atm sfera
8346749 no hay filtros para los furanos y eso no s lo contamina el aire sino toda la cadena alimentaria hay empresas de alimentaci n que en los contratos con sus suministradores de materia prima obligan a que las verduras sean de campos donde no haya una incineradora cerca la industria sabe que el problema existe
8346750 en su d a se fijaron unos l mites de emisiones lo que hay que hacer es vigilar que se cumplan esos l mites y en europa se cumplen no hay riesgos pero sobre todo no hay ninguna duda de que el vertedero es mucho m s contaminante que la incineradora el 4 de los gases de efecto invernadero proviene de la gesti n de residuos y de sos el 90 es de los vertederos
8346751 la ltima directiva de gesti n de residuos aprobada por el parlamento europeo el pasado junio aunque a n no publicada obliga a dejar el vertedero como ltima soluci n de gesti n de la basura el objetivo es que en 2020 los residuos sean o reciclados o convertidos en abono o eliminados obteniendo energ a las incineradoras resuelven eso queman la basura y generan energ a es una f rmula que la sociedad necesita m s ahora que se buscan fuentes de energ a alternativas
8346752 no debemos sobredimensionar las plantas de incineraci n por puro negocio hay que combinar esta opci n con una apuesta por el reciclaje
8346753 por primera vez europa cataloga las incineradoras como elementos de aprovechamiento energ tico no de eliminaci n de basura se olvidan de que incinerar desincentiva el reciclaje que es la aut ntica manera de ahorrar energ a
8346754 los pa ses que m s reciclan de europa alemania francia dinamarca holanda suecia son tambi n los que m s porcentaje de basura incineran y los que menos recurren al vertedero justo al rev s que espa a
8346755 lo peligroso de las incineradoras son las cenizas volantes que se generan en la combusti n las pavesas y los productos que se usan para neutralizar el cloro y el azufre
8346756 s lo representa un 4 de la basura que entra
8346757 y eso se entierra a los tres d as en vertederos especiales guardado en sacos de doble capa
8346758 las incineradoras tienen los l mites m s estrictos que hay en espa a sobre emisi n de contaminantes si te pasas de ese l mite se para la planta si le aplicasen a todas las industrias los l mites de emisi n que nos aplican a nosotros las dioxinas que se emiten proceden de 28 fuentes distintas industrias tabaco tr fico incendios y s lo el 0 001 es responsabilidad de las plantas de incineraci n

8346774 we will continue with our efforts to minimise costs and improve efficiency in our operations which will also contribute to improvement in our performance in the next quarter
8346775 we are targeting to enhance the contribution from exports as a profit growth engine as we shift from completely built up to completely knocked down operations in our core target markets this will result in increasing cost competitiveness and improved volume

8346785 now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete
8346786 we have to draw more attention to the world of nuns who are often not sufficiently appreciated by society
8346787 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god
8346788 we have not only improved profitability but also substantially reduced debt improved cash flow and significantly strengthened our balance sheet
8346789 our focus on expense reduction inventory management and improved gross margin is clearly working and we have managed to show substantial improvement in a very difficult retail environment we will maintain this discipline and continue to manage the company prudently while also addressing the need to improve the top line
8346790 when i went to anwr i expected to see a pristine wilderness teeming with wildlife who knew that this tiny refuge was their only safe haven what i discovered was a broad area just a little bit smaller than the state of tennessee the nearest mountain is 30 miles away and the closest tree is 70 miles past that in this vast and desolate landscape we only need to drill in an area roughly 10 the size of franklin and 20 of germantown tn that operation would mean as many as 750 000 new american jobs these are jobs that would otherwise go to oil producing countries like venezuela saudi arabia or russia i return to tennessee even more convinced that we need to drill here and drill now
8346791 were happy with the verdict but its a shame this should have been limited to one death
8346792 he should have had the courage and the guts to kill himself before killing anyone else
8346793 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work
8346794 he earned this day his actions call out for the death penalty

8346831 that the details of a potentially contentious roll call had finally been hammered out after weeks of discussion with aides to hillary clinton
8346832 as soon as you try to create that with the casting of 101 extras it is never going to be quite the same there is always going to be this artifice
8346833 people told me that chinatown was a very difficult to shoot when you bring in a big production team and lock up the street and bring in all your extras then all the local businesses lose a day s work not everybody is happy to see a movie roll into their block
8346834 it was sort of like shooting in the greatest biggest studio lot it has this authenticity

8346842 but i had a goal with the team before the season started and im sticking to it
8346843 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8346844 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
8346845 obviously it was a big relief for a lot of us we all know what shawne brings to this team especially the defense hes an impact player a difference maker you just kept your fingers crossed that he was going to be able to play but i think in the back of all our minds knowing shawne we know what was in his heart and that he really wanted to play and that any cost possible he was going to find a way to get out there on that field
8346846 peace is a key component of what im here to do
8346847 the overarching idea is that the world is safer if america has more friends more understanding more basis for communication
8346848 the world is safer if we in the united states congress can help diminish the level of desperation of the desperately poor the world is also safer if we can help strengthen democracies so that we dont have failed states
8346849 these guys are french citizens born in france raised in france but talked about how they were having difficulty integrating into french society
8346850 they were curious as to how it is that the american muslim community is so highly integrated and what they can do to facilitate that integration that we have here
8346851 in america you wear one if you want you dont wear one if you dont want
8346852 its left to the individual and it works out fine
8346853 in france we used to consider the american society as very segregationist
8346854 meeting congressman ellison was the first opportunity to change our opinion about america i was very surprised to see a muslim congressman in america which is viewed sometimes as an enemy of islam and muslims
8346855 his experience as muslim and black in the same time convinced me that it is possible in american to build your own dream even if you are a muslim
8346856 hes very effective and that helps us achieve the mission
8346857 they became friends and keith really extended himself by inviting them to join him in minneapolis
8346858 thats the kind of thing were hoping will come from this hdac effort were trying to do much more than congressional groups do when they visit countries
8346859 we had these immigrant communities from somalia ethiopia eritrea and kenya voice how they felt about u s policy toward the horn of africa
8346860 it was a tough meeting because everybody wanted to be heard you had people with long standing grievances really just wanting to be heard by people who represent them
8346861 my own sense is he wants to encourage the forces of moderation and dialogue in the world and works to find alternatives to confrontation
8346862 didnt you swear in on the quran i gotta get a picture of you
8346863 the single most important thing i have to make clear is the choice we have in november between the same failed policy of the last eight years for the middle class and the new agenda to boost income for americans and help families who are struggling i will make that contrast very clearly
8346864 in terms of his speech obama has got to do two things he has to rally his base and he has to reach out to independent voters
8346865 to get people focused on the economy because that is the area of his strength but he also has to reassure people in the areas where they are not as confident of him
8346866 this democratic convention has a vibe so weird and jittery so at odds with the early thrilling fairy dust feel of the obama revolution
8346867 i couldnt understand why he would organise a convention to give the clintons two nights and then diss hillary as vice president

8346894 i saw that i was going to win and i celebrated because i worked hard all year and i got what i wanted
8346895 i think that usains dominance in the 100 metres brings a lot of jealousy because normally you have one country that usually dominates this event
8346896 this was a private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well

8346937 the cons to me outweigh the pros but youve got to sit down and sleep on it and look over the aegean sea and think about it one thing i love about him is that when he goes out to perform he wants to perform to the ultimate level at this point i dont know if he was ready in his heart to do that
8346938 i told him to think about the reality that in two months how are you going to feel everything is worn off and now youre in the battle again do you really want that when youve been working on your other career at that point we came to the conclusion that it didnt make a lot of sense he loves the giants and he loves the fans but it just wasnt the right thing

8347037 we cannot replace them without having to draw down elsewhere

8347152 in the 1700s traditional dances were only performed by men in scotland because women were not allowed to participate
8347153 nearly 125 years later in the early mid 1800s national dances were specifically created for women to perform this was a time of revival for scottish heritage celebrating their ancestry in the form of dance
8347154 after the loss of the battle of culloden in 1746 against the british the highlanders were stripped of everything that created their identity as scots
8347155 i have been dancing for ten years and to this day i still perform scottish dance because i like the fact that it is unusual
8347156 it requires a lot of skill and dedication i watch the more experienced girls with amazement and it challenges me to work toward dancing at the highest level the premiere level
8347157 i started dancing because my mother was born in scotland so it means a lot to me because of my strong scottish heritage
8347158 i also love the combination of stamina and grace of scottish dance needed to perform its not just bouncing around up there
8347159 it is a beautiful athletic and graceful way to dance while also incorporating a competitive component
8347160 i began to get serious about doing this competition through registering under two associations the british association of teachers of dance batd and the federation of united states teachers and adjudicators fusta
8347161 we couldnt have hosted this event if we were not affiliated with these groups
8347162 that number doesnt seem like a lot but it is when you realize that scottish highland dance is such a unique pursuit
8347163 the community is learning more about our presence and those approached have been willing to help the most recent generation seems to be taking to highland dance helping spread its popularity
8347164 im really looking forward to doing what we love and showing our visitors how beautiful this place is

8347284 may have a very disabled child i would not want to change that
8347285 personally ivan hes brought incredible things to my life but it is an enormous challenge and i dont think its right to sort of tell other parents if you hear that youve got a very disabled child on the way that actually doing something about it isnt an option thats my view
8347286 37 states down only 8 to go lets get it done
8347287 while ted kennedy and michelle obama were rocking the democratic convention in denver john mccain made his 13th appearance with jay leno to joke about his age

8347293 the resurrection baptist church was doing tremendous work with thousands of volunteers im sure probably from here at saddleback coordinating the efforts of thou sands of volunteers including my own church the north phoenix baptist church who came from all over america and various authorities off the record told me off the record that they were doing so much more good than the government organizations that it was incredible

8347295 it would provide coverage to every citizen regardless of pre existing condition it is an expanded and improved medicare type plan the free market system has proven to waste dollars on advertising ceo salaries and washington lobbyists it is time to rein in the disproportionate influence of big pharma and the insurance industry

8347297 paul ryan is an elitist and representing a middle class district his integrity and loyalties have been more for corporate america than for the middle class people in his district
8347298 livable wage jobs are being hemorrhaged out of this country at an unprecedented rate for the sake of short term profits by american corporations and the ceo

8347300 non exportable green technology jobs that create a skilled technology sector
8347301 a request to work flexibly brings with it an opportunity for the employer to take a fresh look at how they deliver their goods or services it can raise questions about how a team might work more effectively or efficiently which could be especially useful in the current climate so i very much welcome the consultations focus on raising awareness among employers about flexible working and the many sources of support already available to them
8347302 the process and its paperwork was designed to be light touch and take up so far shows how well it can work be careful about reducing paperwork which is there to protect the interests both of employer and employee verbal agreements can be open to misinterpretation and when the future of somebodys job or the success of someones business is at stake it is really important to have everything clearly recorded the time consuming aspect of considering a request to work flexibly is not really the paperwork it is the thought which needs to go into establishing an arrangement which will work for everyone and that is time well invested which repays itself in loyalty motivation and performance
8347303 the right to request flexible working has worked well because it helps employees to balance their home and work lives but at the same time gives employers the right to say no where there are legitimate business concerns
8347304 parenting requirements dont end as children get older we think it is right to extend this successful scheme and help parents of older children access the flexibility they need
8347305 all of us have seen in the news the frequent reports of young people killing strangers in the street killing fathers defending their property killing people with learning difficulties killing other young people who are different to them
8347306 for 41 years weve lived in a state sponsored culture of death that has killed five million children and were now surprised that some of the surviving children have turned out violent with no regard for the sanctity of life
8347307 how many children know that their mothers have had an abortion what effect will it have on them knowing that they have been deprived of a brother or sister through abortion
8347308 if a society holds human life so cheaply is it any surprise that young people will also hold life cheaply and engage in violence
8347309 crimes against life is it any wonder that criminality in general thrives and seeks to take advantage of the coarsening and darkening of conscience
8347310 i earnestly call on all catholics in my diocese to support politicians who are opposed to abortion euthanasia research on embryonic human beings

8347320 this is the next to last step in a systematic succession plan weve had in place for some time now

8347322 im extremely proud of all that weve accomplished and the meaningful impact weve had on the lives of so many clients employees and shareholders
8347323 i will certainly miss my close relationships with so many friends and business associates however for bb amp t and for me personally this is the right time to move forward nearly 20 years is certainly a long time for anyone to serve as ceo

8347341 we are delighted he is joining us for a short spell to add to our attack
8347342 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8347343 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8347344 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8347345 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8347346 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8347357 the early sixties were like a volcano waiting to erupt with music boy it was like a floodgate that just opened up and american rock took off
8347358 in ireland we didnt have television or anything so my first exposure was radio radio luxemburg and the bbc in the heyday of rock and roll and what they called skiffle music in ireland
8347359 but then ireland also had its own culture of ballads and rebel songs and having gone to school with the christian brothers we were brought up on the rebel songs songs that told a story

8347368 its a lot of hard work but there are some days i cant believe i even get paid i get to sit around with my jazz band and listen to miles davis and john coltrane records and just talk about them
8347369 part of the reason he gets to do that is because the kids have to understand the why of the music not just the how
8347370 why is coltrane so good why is jazz so good why did it grow he is good at doing that stuff
8347371 you watch kids in sixth grade trying to play the childrens song frere jacques and then you watch those same kids their senior year and hear them doing the pat metheny piece last train home
8347372 were kind of the guys that take the wood out of the mill and put the basic form in there and then pass it off to the masters for fine tuning
8347373 this time of year we get to wear our favorite cologne spare varnish and mahogany dust
8347374 then i think nah im getting paid to play in the sun
8347375 we sail we golf we sing and we work when we have to
8347376 but i discipline my body and bring it into subjection
8347377 the ultimate goal of this program is to support the recovery of rare species and natural communities and to prevent their further decline
8347378 the remaining habitat may be the last refuge for many prairie and savanna plants birds and other animals
8347379 many of these species and natural communities are uncommon or nonexistent elsewhere in wisconsin and throughout the united states
8347380 the biggest threat to rare species is loss or degradation of habitat
8347381 with more than 85 percent of wisconsins landscape under private ownership landowners play a key role in helping conserve the beauty and diversity of wisconsins natural heritage for future generations

8347385 im not into looking for signs i think well continue to make our case europe the united states and other leaders around the world will make the case to russia that this is a very short sighted decision on their part
8347386 i think russia has gotten the message im not going to try to speculate as to when that message will influence their decision
8347387 it may take nasa decades to finish construction on a shuttle but it only took the bay view space program a weekend to build its bvsa rocket bike it was originally made so founder jason broemmel who also built the golden gate bridge bike could attempt to jump over islais creek in san francisco for a bike rodeo he fell straight into the water the ride features rockets on either side that are powered by highway flares illegal fireworks and propane broemmels next project a five wheel bike capable of hauling two kegs of beer every astronauts dream
8347388 when we think of todays motorcycles most people will automatically picture a v twin on a sunny afternoon we sometimes forget about the hard hitting single cylinders however franz langer has come up with something that should bring the spotlight back to single cylinders for at least a while mr langer is a german engineer who has always been most interested in the single cylinder design rather than the more common v twin while he was working he filled his garage with 600cc to 700cc motorcycles after he retired he began building his own outrageous rides the cream of the crop came when he decided he wanted to build the worlds largest single cylinder engine on a motorcycle for a long time that benchmark was 1000cc it then made a jump to 1500cc to be able to top that franz began with an airplane engine single cylinder of course that displaced 1440cc the next step was to enlarge the engine and use a larger yet lighter cylinder the final result was a 2000cc monster he then mounted his oversized engine onto an old nsu konsul soon after everything was complete his name was added to the guinness book of world records for building largest single cylinder engine on a motorcycle the only downside to the whole design its a kickstart anyone who weighs less than 150lbs might need some help
8347389 i have hunted 35 different quarterbacks and got them on the ground over 70 sacks
8347390 and at no time in this league have i ever been called a dirty player a cheap shot or a dirty player or anything and that is the most hurtful thing that there is a perception of me that i have turned into a dirty player wow i really dont see that i am over excitable and jovial and a loquacious guy at times most of the time but a cheap shot or dirty guy

8347393 the initial idea was to negotiate a quick two pager to cease hostilities but this has now turned into something more substantial around agreeing the principles of how to run the company
8347394 a deal is a few weeks away they are likely to sign something
8347395 we agreed not to comment on the negotiations and we feel its really important to honor that agreement
8347396 holding an equity stake and having control are two different things in russia
8347397 before the match i really believed i had a chance to win
8347398 i knew if i could hang in there and just get stuck in then id be in with a chance i came away with the win so im pretty pleased with that
8347399 in the first set she may have been a bit scrappy but i felt i did a really good job there
8347400 even in the final set when i went 4 2 down when i lost my serve there i never felt at that point that i would lose the match
8347401 i felt that if i just kept fighting and hanging in there then my chance would come and yes i got there
8347402 not many people can say they have a gold medal
8347403 shes someone ive never played against before ive practised with her in the past and it will definitely be another tough match for me
8347404 but ive got nothing to lose i feel confident i feel fit and you know who knows
8347405 the requirement right now in iraq is much more about nation building than it is fighting and quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country
8347406 its our view that if theres a stiffer fight going on someplace else then thats where we need to be
8347407 a battalion of marines in afghanistan count for more than a battalion of marines in iraq
8347408 we can do with a lesser number of marines in afghanistan i believe at this point and have the same effect
8347409 we think there is a way to backfill with some marines if theres a commensurate decision to draw down in iraq and we think the conditions are such there that thats plausible
8347410 we cannot replace them without having to draw down elsewhere
8347411 and the only elsewhere at this point that i see available is in iraq
8347412 ive been having a debate with peterklaver on a different thread about misusing free speech peter you need to know that im tempted seriously tempted to heap scorn on this particular brand of christianity im fighting hard peter but might yet succumb pray for me wont you
8347413 iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8347414 there is no greater threat to israel or to the peace and stability of the region than iran
8347415 birth is one of my favorite scores as good as anything ive heard in 25 years
8347416 alexandres music is playful and witty but i think its the oblique nature by which he goes at things with composers i think you have to hire somebody you believe in and then get the fuck out of the way
8347417 the story of benjamin button is somehow epic but the orchestra is not huge and loud
8347418 chamber music is the most delicate thing you can imagine precision on such a score is crucial because if the trumpet doesnt have the right mute doesnt play perfectly in tune or plays too loud its very exposed it doesnt work
8347419 weve all only heard desplats music in the button trailer
8347420 i havent had the opportunity to take any calls since we landed so im sure there will be an update waiting for me but until i get that i cant give any more news
8347421 were obviously keen to bring him to the club if we can if the opportunity presents itself well try to pursue it but were not further down the road as yet
8347422 the situation before we flew was the same it may have moved forward or it may have gone backwards but until i put the call in i wont know
8347423 i dont know how long we can continue to refine when we are selling products at regulated prices we buy crude oil at the international price only to refine and sell at regulated price we have lost about n48 billion through this we have made our case known to the president now we are discussing with the ministry of finance and we have been assured we will be paid if we are not paid i dont know how we are going to continue
8347424 this incident drastically impacted on our import and products evacuation capabilities there was also a fire incident on the refinery cooling tower in april 2008 but efforts are on going to repair the damage he however enthused that despite the challenges the phrc operates at 60 capacity

8347431 the group managing director of the nnpc and the communities where the oil companies are operating belong to the federal government because the government has 55 percent while shell elf and agip oil have the rest 45 percent so they should recognise any community as their host community because when you talk to shell at times they are going to napims ten years they will never carry out that project and at the end if you go to shell they will say napims did not approve
8347432 we will not every time bother the oil companies when our own government representative is very far it is not proper so we want them very close
8347433 smart and effective use of technology is key to qwests success and the future of minnesotas students
8347434 we want to encourage and reward educators who are applying technology in new and creative ways to engage students in learning

8347436 we appreciate qwests generosity and encourage educators to take advantage of this opportunity
8347437 qwests teachers and technology grant program highlights qwest as an excellent example of leadership in supporting minnesota educators to improve stem education and prepare students for 21st century opportunities

8347441 this benefit extends even to well advertised events such as professional football games
8347442 issues around infrastructure are complicated after all the work is expensive and the entrenched view of roads as a local matter means theyre often taken for granted in the national debate
8347443 in other words talking about potholes doesnt get presidential votes
8347444 the high stakes game is aimed partly at mapping out the possible transportation policies of a new administration under either candidate
8347445 more significantly however its aimed at filling in the transportation gaps for each candidate and setting policy planks more firmly to turn them into actions next january
8347446 todays tools are able to manage various types of content and put specific types of content onto specific devices
8347447 what is truly needed however and what we expect to see emerge over the next few years are tools that unlock the value of content in the digital age by formatting and managing content for device independence when content becomes reusable across multiple delivery channels its value increases enormously which will foster investment in developing the next generation of content management tools

8347456 the acquisition of postpath complements our strategy to develop an integrated collaboration platform designed for how we work today and into the future providing real productivity gains and a more satisfying user experience
8347457 we have been unhappy with microsoft for some time before the release of exchange 2007 which included voip voice over internet protocol in its unified messaging suite it was time to offer our customers an alternative
8347458 if you think about what were going to do we usually acquire when we move into new markets that we do not have the expertise for the product segments in
8347459 once again cisco makes a sound investment in an email technology vendor just like it did with
8347460 these are the clever guys who reverse engineered the exchange client protocol mapi rpc and the related on the wire details needed to make a vanilla install of outlook talk to a non exchange mail server with full fidelity impressive stuff of all the other exchange alternatives postpath has the most interesting architecture and i say that as one who has years emotionally invested in the openmail technology
8347461 i think cisco fell out of love with microsoft a while back something to do with voip support in exchange and how cisco thought it was microsofts partner but it turned out that microsoft was competing with them nothing familiar there at all
8347462 sounds like cisco wants to offer saas collaboration based on postpath and webex whoever said the email world has become dull and uninteresting
8347463 the tip was the managers knew they were hiring illegals

8347465 the men come in with a certain kind of nudge nudge wink wink what am i going to get out of this day
8347466 they come out with a completely different understanding of the realities of whats going on that they didnt have before
8347467 the men need to understand the girls arent out there because they want to be they are out there because they are trying to survive
8347468 would you want her to be out there prostituting her body they all say no absolutely not
8347469 so we say why someone elses daughter these women belong to someone
8347470 a lot of the men come in thinking its pretty woman an even exchange victimless crime and they leave with a sense of what reality is

8347475 we havent seen the trough of the credit cycle yet
8347476 if the agency gets through the credit mess having handled the bank failures that are to come she is going to be widely seen as the person who prepared the agency for this

8347491 our efforts are to first evacuate the civilians and then go for the final action
8347492 we are exercising maximum restraint to ensure the civilians are safe we have every apprehension that the terrorists may harm the civilians

8347512 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
8347513 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me

8347527 the banking industry goes into this mess much stronger than it was
8347528 as the fdic incurs losses those losses will be passed back to the banking industry
8347529 we had one of the largest and certainly what we think will be one of the most expensive failures at the beginning of the cycle

8347551 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life

8347579 lazio memang sedang membangun skuadnya yang mempunyai prospek namun di atas kertas perbedaan masih besar
8347580 lazio telah melakukan kerja yang fantastis namun tetap ada jarak antara mereka dan roma masih yang terbaik
8347581 lazio masih dibawah roma namun pelatih lazio telah melakukan kerja bagus dan mereka lebih baik dibanding musim lalu
8347582 mentalitas pemain kami sangat buruk dalam pertandingan tadi dari cara mereka bermain terlihat mereka mengganggap remeh pertandingan ini
8347583 praktis penampilan anak anak jauh di bawah kualitas mereka yang sebenarnya
8347584 once i can make calls using the wi fi network i will in all likelihood reduce the monthly minutes i have with at amp t
8347585 m is just so unimaginative and unoriginal they have no taste
8347586 new leadership to unite our people and forge a clear national direction
8347587 he badawi does not have the minimal credibility needed to run the country day by day let alone to take it in the new directions we need to go in a complex world
8347588 dont panic we have nothing to fear from an aging society
8347589 there would be only two persons of working age for every person aged 65 or more in 2060 compared with four persons to one today
8347590 one of the major challenges europe must face with climate change and globalization
8347591 the consequences of the aging population poses a greater threat to the national economy than climate change
8347592 its not as sexy a subject as climate change so this subject gets shoved off into the corner but its economic consequences are enormous and were calling on the government and the opposition to give the priority in a bipartisan way which will enable australia to avoid going bankrupt
8347593 i am so tired of the laziness of reporters who constantly trot out the common wisdom
8347594 like it or not the chinese solution to population control is no longer to be dismissed by the rest of the world
8347595 what we could see is that the storm destroys some rigs
8347596 that our supply could be hindered for an unforeseen amount of time
8347597 there is a very heavy concentration of refineries along the gulf coast
8347598 if the storm hits land and it is very powerful when it hits land it could disrupt some refinery operations
8347599 once gustav gets into the gulf of mexico conditions are favorable for further strengthening
8347600 one of the most menacing aspects of gustav is that its approaching over a three day weekend
8347601 i think obamas speech is going to unite the nation
8347602 he has the ability to do that when he speaks to large groups of people people will be mesmerized
8347603 youve got so much candy you dont know what to pick from
8347604 well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
8347605 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad
8347606 i think she gave a very good speech from her point of view and our point of view but not necessarily for
8347607 she never really answered the key question is he prepared to be president which is the issue she put out there rather dramatically during the primaries
8347608 why isnt she the vice presidential candidate why isnt she the
8347609 if you are going out of business you dont go down with the ship you get another ship for us its natural gas
8347610 building new wind generation facilities and better utilizing our natural gas resources can replace more than one third of our foreign oil imports in 10 years
8347611 gore asked if we could we join together and do something
8347612 i told him no because global warming is on page two for me page one is foreign oil
8347613 the u s will be importing a significant amount of oil its a step toward energy independence in that it expands renewable energy production but i think framing this debate in terms of energy independence isnt the way to go if you want to take a populist angle on this pushing the very real benefits that wind power and renewables in general can have in local economies stands on much more solid ground
8347614 pickens has stated on numerous occasions that of course hes going to make money off the pickens plan
8347615 thats the nature of what he does and has done but natural gas is probably better used to generate electricity than as a fuel source in cars a better solution is electrically powered vehicles while there are still technical issues if our transportation fleet was all electric you could power it from whatever is the most regionally appropriate way of generating electricity cleanly and cheaply as our ability to generate clean power improves there would be theoretically no need to change the transportation fleet
8347616 gas is not the solution for the future no matter how the gas industry tries to portray it
8347617 with the water crisis looming in the future and his track record on selling water regardless of the environmental cost
8347618 pickens will be viewed in the future as irresponsible his background on promoting renewable energy cant erase his current disregard for the sustainable use of water he recently supplemented his property holdings in texas with 200 000 acres of land atop the ogallala aquifer under texas law this purchase entitles mesa water pickens new company to take more than 320 000 acre feet of water equivalent to more than 104 million gallons from the property the ogallala is already severely depleted and its outrageous that he can stick a pipe in the ground and suck this water out without any environmental impact assessment
8347619 pickens used the enormous wind farm erected on his property as a means to lobby for the right to pipe the ogallala water to a major metropolitan center
8347620 he successfully passed a bill through the texas legislature to allow a water supply district to transport alternative energy and water in a single corridor pickens also successfully loosened the legal definitions of a water district allowing him to invoke the right of eminent domain so that he could build the pipeline through the property of several neighboring landowners we should be concerned with these types of underhanded business dealings
8347621 we all know that he wants to be loved just call him call him any time of day or night
8347622 talk to him about anything talk to him about the olympics or what he thinks about a certain congressional district or even about the
8347623 the one thing that we are so excited about this year is the fact that were presenting five dramatic first features from the region which is almost unheard of
8347624 and this really speaks to growth in the industry the fact that theres this many people that are really launching the next level of their career
8347625 the festival has nurtured and humoured me as a filmmaker for about 10 years
8347626 the festival is that thing that you aim for its the most immediate thing that you have to know theres a good possibility your work is going to be shown
8347627 the battle took place in sarobi district when militants attacked government checkpoints on tuesday and afghan troops called in air support during which 40 enemies were killed
8347628 first you have to know with no fear that someday you are going to die until you know that you are useless
8347629 the urge to save humanity is almost always a false front for the urge to rule
8347630 presidents are not elected by ballot they are selected by blood
8347631 what a self mockery these people have made of themselves
8347632 i dont want a f king abortion clinic in my neighborhood
8347633 i believe that every individual is naturally entitled to do as he
8347634 i believe that every individual is naturally entitled to do as he
8347635 what a self mockery these people have made of themselves
8347636 habitually mistakes shrill for thought provoking and substitutes screaming for discussion
8347637 well i think that based on the military intelligence and legal assessments at the time the roosevelt administration did the best that it could do
8347638 michelle malkins book in defense of internment the case for racial profiling in world war ii and the war on terror is a desperate attempt to impugn the loyalty of japanese americans during world war ii to justify harsher governmental policies today in the treatment of arab and muslim americans
8347639 in light of her new book and guest column in the star bulletin justifying the internment of japanese american families in wwii we felt she had become a detriment to our reputation and to our business
8347640 t here is a concerted organized effort to dig up and publicize the private home information of prominent conservatives in the media and blogosphere to intimidate them
8347641 a nti jihad youtube users have reported having their videos yanked and accounts suspended
8347642 attacked as an aunt thomasina and a sellout and a race traitor by liberals of asian background
8347643 will you apologize for being a political prostitute for bill oreilly a white male chauvinist racist as a woman of color
8347644 theres only one whore on this split screen and its you mr shabazz you should be ashamed of yourself for profiting off of your racial poison
8347645 you should be ashamed of yourself for defending and being a spokesman for bill oreilly
8347646 that six sunni civilians had been burned to death with kerosene
8347647 as i noted on the 4th the ap reported that the ministry of interior in iraq has now said a captain jamil hussein does work in the al khadra police station
8347648 the ap has confirmed damage at three of the four mosques including burn damage at two and slight damage at a third
8347649 michelle malkin is the most vile hateful commentator ive ever met in my life
8347650 she actually believes that neighbors should start snitching out neighbors and we should be deporting people
8347651 at this point im going to give the management the benefit of the doubt
8347652 national politics to niche issues of interest to specific communities
8347653 living in a nation where people are not judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character

8347655 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8347656 the writing is reminiscent of the scene in the deer hunter when robert de niros character states this is this
8347657 stellaa with respect to the south our centrist governed states are growing business and education
8347658 i cant help but notice that its we southerners who are gaga for bipartisanship edgar alverson is in ga im in nc
8347659 you know the bipartisanship bit is exactly the part i like about obama
8347660 unwillingness to listen to opposing viewpoints is a typical human trait
8347661 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8347662 abc cbs and nbc did not air any of leachs speech while msnbc and fox news aired only seconds of it
8347663 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8347664 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8347665 we welcome the tata group here in uttaranchal and establish their project we are talking with tatas at an official level and we hope that we will be able to reach at a conclusion very soon it will be good for uttaranchal as with the coming of the tata group employment will be generated and it will be beneficial for the tatas too as they can reap the benefits of subsidies and special privileges that have been allotted to uttaranchal by the central government
8347666 if tatas nano plant will reach uttarakhand it will be very beneficial for our generation as we are educated but dont have good jobs if the nano plant is estanblished here this problem of unemployment will be solved
8347667 youre going to be entering that cone of silence tomorrow
8347668 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity

8347675 on est en train de d stabiliser la fili re et ce nest pas acceptable
8347676 le gouvernement par la voix de la direction de la concurrence a fait une erreur grotesque
8347677 je suis particuli rement attentif aux conclusions de la rencontre qui aura lieu jeudi rennes entre entremont et les producteurs laitiers
8347678 les tensions qui existent entre lentreprise entremont alliance et les producteurs de lait qui lapprovisionnent rel vent dune n gociation caract re priv
8347679 le groupe entremont doit r mun rer ces producteurs sur la base dune hausse de 49 euros pour les 1 000 litres de lait au lieu des 30 initialement propos s cest la seule sortie du conflit possible
8347680 le ministre a parfaitement pris conscience des enjeux pour la fili re laiti re et il tient sinvestir pour que les choses voluent rapidement

8347686 ive been a rangers fan all my life and i can tell you theres been plenty of fucking crying in baseball
8347687 black people should stop playing the race card my parents were imigrants from and we pulled ourselves up on our own it seems to me that the only racists are the people who cry racism
8347688 ok blacks have rights now lets forget slavery ever happened
8347689 no dude you screwed us over and you still do dont ignore it just cuz you feel guilty
8347690 did i lose that job opportunity because im black did that officer stop me cause im a minority did that old lady give me a dirty stare cause she thought i was going to steal her purse
8347691 another question i have is why do many of the blacks from the caribbean seem to adjust to american white society better than many of the blacks who are descendants of us slaves
8347692 these damn north american chilren have it way too easy here
8347693 if we were to wake up one morning and find that we were all the same race religion and nationality wed find some other reason to hate each other by noon
8347694 mlk was not confrontational he was anything but he never did anything to cause violence and deplored it
8347695 yeah they want to kill obama because he is black
8347696 see this is disgusting we need to stop this and we need
8347697 most folksll never lose a toe but then again some folksll like cletus the slack jawed yokel
8347698 and if im an elitist because im going to college and dont want to live in a trailer so be it
8347699 way to be racist in your own way basically called me a white supremacist thanks jerk
8347700 adolf had previously threatened to kill the illinois senator and that the groups desire to assassinate him was not political but because obama is black
8347701 the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants
8347702 there is no credible evidence that saddam husseins government in iraq collaborated with the al qaeda terrorist network on any attacks on the united states
8347703 go google why rush lost his job being a sports color commentator
8347704 adolf had previously threatened to kill the illinois senator and that the groups desire to assassinate him was not political but because obama is black
8347705 the fbi and the us secret service carried out an
8347706 the alleged threat does not warrant charges at this time but we are keeping an open mind
8347707 adolf had previously threatened to kill the illinois senator and that the groups desire to assassinate him was not political but because obama is black
8347708 well i cant do nuthin but at least i aint black
8347709 if i say in conversation that i know a woman who is opinionated vicious and ugly i do distrust the man who immediately says sir you are talking about my mother
8347710 this is not a democracy and we are going to kill anyone who doesnt know their place

8347713 we are excited to be working with rec solar in providing clean energy during the convention
8347714 rec solars vision is to make solar electricity part of the mainstream energy supply to make that shift in paradigm a reality we recognize that we must reach out to the next generation of energy consumers in their preferred online medium
8347715 with the assistance of myspace the solar recharging stations are designed to not only raise awareness of alternative energy sources that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on fossil fuels but also to encourage a sense of community both online and offline

8347719 we do understand canadians frustration with fuel price volatility in particular but at the same time in our view thats the best evidence of a well functioning competitive market
8347720 in our view canadians are well served by a competitive marketplace and today they still pay the second lowest price for fuel in the western world
8347721 the oil companies are making huge profits when consumers are dinged at the pumps
8347722 its not the folks who are delivering fuel to canadians all over that are making money
8347723 at least 70 per cent of canadas gas stations see no benefit from rising prices but rather profits are declining as a result of increased credit card costs
8347724 the price of diesel affects every economic sector because it affects public transportation it affects the cost of goods that are transported
8347725 why is it that consumers seem to have more knowledge than the people who work in the industry
8347726 we simply cant drill our way to energy independence even if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards including the ones he cant even remember
8347727 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that young boy and his mom struggling on the minimum wage
8347728 the high court has not given any reasons for refusing to grant leave to file appeal against acquittal and seems to have been completely oblivious to the fact that by such refusal a close scrutiny of the order of acquittal by the appellate forum has been lost once and for all
8347729 reasons are live links between the mind of the decision taker to the controversy in question and the decision or conclusion arrived at
8347730 if you want me us ptf to be around in 10 or 20 years then we have to find a way this outreach work can support itself
8347731 i believe in hard work and in staying true to family and friends i believe in giving i was lucky but i always tried to do right by my fans
8347732 i believe passion discipline courage and honor are the fundamentals of life i too have been lucky but win or lose ive always tried to be a true sportsman both on and off the playing fields
8347733 there is no possible way to prove that god exists so faith is an absolute requirement
8347734 reality doesnt change only our understanding of it changes reality does not need faith to exist it simply exists
8347735 exactly which means that it is impossible for god to exist
8347736 its just one of the fun little facts that shows how utterly arbitrary christianity and really religion as a whole actually is
8347737 and when its time to move ill just pack up and move and get out to safety
8347738 now is the time to go to the store stock on those batteries and those supplies dont wait til this weekend dont wait til whether we know the storm is coming here in 24 or 48 hours dont wait until the state and the local parishes start asking for evacuations now is the time

8348049 to my supporters my champions my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits from the bottom of my heart thank you
8348050 you never gave in you never gave up and together we made history
8348051 and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8348052 to create a health care system that is universal high quality and affordable so that parents no longer have to choose between care for themselves or their children or be stuck in dead end jobs simply to keep their insurance
8348053 to create a world class education system and make college affordable again
8348054 to fight for an america defined by deep and meaningful equality from civil rights to labour rights from womens rights to gay rights from ending discrimination to promoting unionisation to providing help for the most important job there is caring for our families

8348058 no matter the outcome we continue to believe lucentis is the most appropriate treatment for wet amd
8348059 its a very unusual situation where a company would be trying to compare its own drugs
8348060 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case
8348061 good news is that the board supports the proposed studies
8348062 the fact that we are comparing your drugs and you are not involved is very awkward and can easily give way to anti genentech sentiments
8348063 the leaders of this study are only interested in answering the many scientific and patient management questions that we face with our patients every day but some investigators and the press want this study to be more than that your involvement would be very helpful to both of our causes
8348064 our resources would be better spent looking at other diseases where there are no treatments
8348065 by fact that they didnt support the clinical study leads me to conclude that in reality there is no difference between the two drugs
8348066 i see this as a public health study not only for us but for the whole world it gives everyone the license to use both drugs interchangeably
8348067 clearly for medicare it would make economic sense to put preference on the use of avastin
8348068 it would surprise me if the contractors did not quickly use that concept

8348080 finally a book that emphasizes the role of the sql writer on overall database performance and what can be done to improve the situation this book should be required reading for any database professional wanting to improve their own query writing or queries written by others

8348082 this book is packed with treasures you will experience an ahha moment before putting it down mr faroults significant experience and clear thinking is generously shared within these pages

8348090 it looks great but how can i really use it in my business
8348091 critically but also very very sadly russia has not reconciled itself to the new map of this new region
8348092 the president of russia has said he was not afraid of a new cold war we do not want a new cold war and he has a big responsibility not to start one we need to raise the costs to russia for disregarding its responsibility
8348093 i do not apologise for rejecting knee jerk calls for russia to be expelled from the g8 or for eu russia relations to be broken but we do need to examine the nature depth and breadth of relations with russia
8348094 i repeat that it is very dangerous and there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia in particular the crimea ukraine and moldova
8348095 the build up of nato forces in the black sea area
8348096 russia clearly intended this as a blatant challenge to world order its now up to all of us to roll russian aggression back if they get away with this they will carry on they will also attack other countries in the neighbourhood
8348097 we will be ready to make decisions including in the united nations on additional increases in the number of international monitors clarifying their mandate and possibly other steps with international participation
8348098 russia has not reconciled itself to the new map of this new region we do not want a new cold war and he medvedev has a big responsibility not to start one
8348099 we are sorry about this decision for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we cannot support this position
8348100 we will see how this will develop we are sticking strictly to the conditions on the timetable for the russian fleets presence there
8348101 now we have people flexing their muscles demonstrating force we can only regret that

8348104 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8348105 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8348106 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8348107 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8348108 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8348109 what will happen i dont know we will wait and see but i think we are better positioned

8348171 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8348172 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8348173 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8348174 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8348175 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8348176 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8348177 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8348178 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8348179 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8348180 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8348181 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8348182 by any yardstick it was another rough quarter for bank earnings but the results were not unexpected as the industry coped with financial market disruptions the housing slump worsening economic conditions and the overall downturn in the credit cycle

8348209 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8348210 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8348211 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8348212 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8348213 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8348214 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8348215 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8348216 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8348217 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8348218 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8348219 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

8348246 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8348247 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8348248 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8348249 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

8348256 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8348257 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8348258 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8348259 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8348260 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8348261 if they want to put us in jail well go to jail we arent going anywhere
8348262 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8348263 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8348264 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8348265 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8348266 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8348267 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8348268 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8348269 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8348270 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8348271 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8348272 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8348273 who are open to doing something on the production side
8348274 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8348275 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8348276 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

8348281 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8348282 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8348283 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8348284 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8348285 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8348286 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

8348294 he was doing a good job of propagating the bright points of hinduism and the missionaries were not able to convert the tribal people as effectively as they were doing previously
8348295 the rest of what happened is something the government needs to investigate and tell the people of india
8348296 i would say the violence is seven times worse than in december
8348297 i mean the government is trying its best but its like a mad frenzy they are just destroying everything

8348317 regulations that implement proposition 103s mandate that insurance rates reflect a drivers mileage will lower auto insurance premiums particularly when the high cost of gasoline is encouraging people to drive less
8348318 they will also give consumers a financial incentive to carpool and promote mass transit and other transportation technologies that can reduce the impact of driving on our environment and our costly reliance on oil assembly member jared huffmans attention to this important issue along with other organizations led to todays announcement we also applaud commissioner poizners prompt action in drafting the proposed regulations
8348319 lawmakers and regulators have stepped up to the plate to help californians green their insurance policies and save people money
8348320 now insurance companies must do their part by giving drivers real savings when they drive less
8348321 todays tools are able to manage various types of content and put specific types of content onto specific devices

8348334 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8348335 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8348336 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that

8348403 the union uses the tactic of saying immigration was coming and the members of the union would not be taken
8348404 i need a job and got kids i heard that they need some help now
8348405 all them mexicans got fired because they didnt have a pass all these businesses have been taking americans jobs
8348406 that doesnt justify but it certainly explains why they might be hiring individuals who show up and say ill work for you

8348434 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8348435 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8348436 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8348437 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8348438 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8348439 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8348440 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8348441 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8348442 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8348443 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8348444 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8348445 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8348446 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8348447 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8348448 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8348449 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8348450 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8348451 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8348452 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8348453 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8348454 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8348455 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8348456 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8348457 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8348458 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8348459 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8348460 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8348461 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8348462 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8348463 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8348464 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8348465 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8348466 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8348467 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8348468 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8348469 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8348470 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8348471 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8348472 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8348473 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8348474 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8348475 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8348476 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8348477 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8348478 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8348479 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8348480 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8348481 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8348482 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8348483 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8348484 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8348485 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8348486 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8348487 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8348488 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8348489 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8348490 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8348491 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8348492 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8348493 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8348494 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8348495 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8348496 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8348497 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8348498 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8348499 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8348500 no one works for someone we all just work together
8348501 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8348502 i tried to help with the x games a little while back by giving them feedback and being an interviewer but they fired me

8348504 a young woman had died in his office and that she had a complicated medical history specifically surrounding stroke and epilepsy
8348505 swings his little club with about as much discrimination as bamm bamm the diaper clad pugilist on the flintstones
8348506 its not really the media so much as it is sort of this political class of people who just go around causing trouble all the time
8348507 for instance it is spread all over the internet right now that my staff member lori klausutis who died tragically a month ago was killed by me i could list a thousand conspiracy theories against me that i rig elections that i have a drug running outfit with the cia that im a murderer that i have 15 illegitimate children
8348508 there is an old saying that warns that if you allow people to assume the worst they will so be it
8348509 dont be afraid to be funny because you are funny i asked you why you arent in congress you said that you had sex with the intern and then you had to kill her

8348517 theres no place where you can hide anymore and park your brain like i did at that manufacturing plant
8348518 you have to be engaged thats what today is about this is not just a building or a training program its about how were educating our future
8348519 this new building is symbolic in a couple of ways
8348520 it shows what private partnerships can do such as the one between the college and bsh home appliances corporation it also showcases lifelong learning because it houses early college students and places to train manufacturing workers
8348521 we all know jobs are going south of the river and to the far east
8348522 we here in the high coast country can only sustain a future through knowledge and making products through knowledge were excited about the future this building brings
8348523 will finally get the chance to experience a night of music and history they have been waiting decades for
8348524 there is no doubt that it was a great missed opportunity to prevent people like you who shaped the minds of the generation to come to israel and perform
8348525 ive heard so many great things about tel aviv and israel but hearing is one thing and experiencing it for yourself is another
8348526 we are planning to have a great time and a great evening we cant wait to get out there and rock
8348527 re establish with the members of the various communities the peaceful cohabitation and the harmony that has always been the distinctive mark of the indian society
8348528 the state is a mute spectator to the violence that has been unleashed in the christian community
8348529 very seriously and now they are going to pay them back
8348530 this is nothing but pure political hate propaganda against the christians when the root problem is of course caste oppression
8348531 he was doing a good job of propagating the bright points of hinduism and the missionaries were not able to convert the tribal people as effectively as they were doing previously
8348532 the rest of what happened is something the government needs to investigate and tell the people of india
8348533 i would say the violence is seven times worse than in december
8348534 i mean the government is trying its best but its like a mad frenzy they are just destroying everything
8348535 the single greatest strength america has in the middle east
8348536 you dont have to be a jew to be a zionist
8348537 if tomorrow peace broke out between israelis and palestinians does
8348538 so lets get it straight israel is not the cause of iraq iraq being settled or not settled has nothing to do with israels conduct
8348539 from 9 11 americans can taste what it must feel like for every israeli mother and father when they send their kid out to school with their lunch to put them on a bus on a bicycle or to walk and they pray to god that cell phone doesnt ring
8348540 theres a rationale in my view why pollard should be given leniency but there is not a rationale to say what happened did not happen and should be pardoned
8348541 i think people get whats going on lets see how this thing gets a happy ending
8348542 id rather break the law than live with injustice my whole life
8348543 yang jias abnormal behavior is a measure of abnormality in our own society
8348544 some raised the issue of why he did it so this got into bigger issue of maybe there were injustices carried out by the shanghai police
8348545 thats where i think authorities would not want this case to go
8348546 yesterday i wrote one about why the shanghai court didnt put the notice of the trials schedule on its web site which the law says they should do three days in advance
8348547 the proof that terrorist groups are cornered by our security forces
8348548 algerian blood is being spilled in the name of foreign criminal interests
8348549 a jury was able to see that and come to the correct verdict
8348550 we thought there was certainly enough evidence to convict this person of this crime the jury chose to ignore it
8348551 im not saying its a conspiracy but you know what it certainly gives pause and gives a motive
8348552 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8348553 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8348554 wouldnt it be great if you had one of these for business wouldnt it be great if each leader could have one to direct them through their business strategy
8348555 oh anna you already have one it is called a brain the only thing that leaders are missing is a definite destination that they want to get to once you understand where you want to go click the brain into action and let it take you there
8348556 the hijackers surrendered without any violence and the crew are safe and sound
8348557 i thank the libyan authorities for their efforts which allowed us to be freed
8348558 we categorically deny the responsibility of our movement in this hijacking operation
8348559 we dont support putting the lives of sudanese civilians at risk in any circumstances
8348560 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8348561 the mind is a dangerous place to walk around in alone
8348562 the number of children covered by government health insurance programs increased to 31 percent from 29 8 percent in 2006
8348563 d espite all the effort and hope that patients and their families and doctors have put into breast cancer research and treatment in the past 100 years those like marguerite who present with advanced metastatic cancer probably do not live much longer than their early 20th century counterparts it is harder to determine whether they live better
8348564 a recent report from the university of colorado shows that obese people who start a supervised swimming program do not lower their fasting blood sugar insulin total cholesterol good hdl cholesterol and bad ldl cholesterol levels they also did not lose weight or redistribute their body fat 2
8348565 the sport has a pace where you have to be very sensitive if this works well and it will work well i think this will help the sport help us get it right in an area that has become increasingly difficult
8348566 i dont plan on giving any home runs up on thursday so it shouldnt really bother me
8348567 as long as we can keep throwing baseballs while theyre doing the reviews that delay wont be a problem but i hope im not the first one who has to do it
8348568 i dont know if its necessary or not but i know its going to be fair to both teams you dont want home runs taken away from you
8348569 if its more than a handful of times ill be surprised its such a tough call in some other ballparks i really think they need help on those calls theres still going to be human error but with our technology theyre going to get it right
8348570 im more old school im a guy who likes the human decision of the umpire right call or wrong call
8348571 a guy might be safe and hes called out and everyone jumps up and down the fans go crazy thats kind of cool
8348572 there are a lot of bad calls you just get through it where will this end and this system isnt going to be perfect either theyre not going to catch everything
8348573 i think its really great every other sport has it why not baseball
8348574 if you have the technology why not use it everyones happier if the call is right
8348575 they can do balls and strikes that would be fine with me
8348576 i dont want to make any predictions that ill be sorry about but there are some people who believe if we handle it right it could actually be efficient in shortening the game a little bit
8348577 harnessing the power of castle grayskull the manufacturers of this desk globe have created a levitating world
8348578 tabletop foosball is a slick alternative to a full size foosball table
8348579 well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
8348580 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad
8348581 if i dont make the team the controversy is gone if i do it will come back again and again its a double edged sword
8348582 people can expect to have their person seached and their bags searched
8348583 i would urge folks to look at that list on the dncc website and make sure they dont have those items if folks dont have those items that are prohibited then the lines will move much quicker
8348584 i dont like to make predictions but i think its going to continue to be very challenging and i think the number of banks and assets on the troubled bank list will continue to go up
8348585 youre talking about roughly 45 billion of reserves insuring 4 5 trillion of deposits
8348586 and youre in an environment right now where non current loans delinquent loans are increasing at a faster pace than banks putting aside reserves thats not a good thing
8348587 youve got a risk of siphoning off capital when its needed
8348588 obviously i was lied to when signing papers and those who sold me the house knew i would be unable to afford the house
8348589 itll be a little cooler friday and cooler yet saturday
8348590 the farther away from the ocean you go the warmer its going to be
8348591 more than 1 3 million acres have already burned this year in california
8348592 vegetation is extremely dry across the state and when you add these dry north winds to the mix the chance of a major fire igniting increases
8348593 the scandal of americas drug courts is that we have rushed headlong into them driven by politics fuzzy headed notions about restorative justice and by bureaucrats universal fear of being the last on the block to have the latest administrative gimmick
8348594 a reporter with kmbc in kansas city had a big scoop barack obama would pick indiana sen evan bayh to be his running mate except that didnt happen oops the station broke into programming with the hot news
8348595 we cannot know given the state of our current knowledge whether an elixir of extremely long life is possible
8348596 the question is can we mimic the evolutionary process to the extent that senescence becomes essentially negligible at this stage the answer must be that we do not know
8348597 although there is no scientific reason for not striving to cure ageing similar to what we profess to do for cancer and other diseases our current understanding makes it impossible to assert that indefinite postponement is feasible
8348598 current findings involving simple organisms leave no doubt that lifespan is plastic
8348599 but research needs to take into account the idiosyncrasies of model organisms and the complexity of humans who do not live in laboratories
8348600 i think bergers primary mistakes were his not understanding the variations in skeletal populations in which he was working using fragmentary remains in a situation where he didnt understand variations and stepping outside his own area of expertise
8348601 vote for obama this right here is no country for old men
8348602 may be an important reason for the unique cooperative abilities of humans
8348603 probably because humans also have a preference for others well being
8348604 the simultaneous development of altruistic behaviour and preference of the own group provides interesting new impulses for the conjecture that both of these processes are driven by the same evolutionary process
8348605 might be a decisive factor in the evolution of inequity aversion
8348606 adult chimpanzees show no preference for sharing with an identifiable colleague

8348941 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8348942 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8348943 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8348944 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8348945 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8348946 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize

8348950 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8348951 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8348952 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8348953 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8348954 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8348955 im going to count my blessings and keep on going im going to keep doing what i was doing long before the cameras ever showed up and what ill be doing long after theyre gone

8349013 terrorism destroying israel those arent serious threats obama dangerously unprepared to be president
8349014 and ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the berlin wall

8349211 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8349212 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8349213 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8349214 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8349215 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8349216 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8349217 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8349218 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8349219 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

8349240 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca
8349241 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
8349242 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
8349243 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
8349244 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
8349245 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
8349246 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
8349247 le gouvernement aurait bien tort de penser que notre m moire puisse tre d faillante sil ne tient pas ses engagements le conflit quil aura vit en juillet aura lieu coup s r en octobre
8349248 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
8349249 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
8349250 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
8349251 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
8349252 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
8349253 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
8349254 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
8349255 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
8349256 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
8349257 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
8349258 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
8349259 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
8349260 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
8349261 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention

8349269 for us the security of the hostages is most important
8349270 this will give some confidence to the hostages inside the house that there are people still keeping watch over the militant who is holding them hostage
8349271 our final assault will have to wait till either the inmates have been released by the militants or we are able to rescue them
8349272 this civilian hostages is what is holding us up from launching final onslaught we are ready for that

8349281 we believe the province could turn over to iraqi control in just a few days
8349282 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
8349283 anbar remains a dangerous place but the ever growing ability of the iraqi security forces continues to move us closer to seeing iraqi control of the province
8349284 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business
8349285 its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going some place else in a much more expeditionary environment where the marine air ground task force really seems to have a true and enduring value then thats where we need to be

8349292 solid capital and sizable reserves for potential loan losses show once again that thrift managers are responding appropriately to the challenges they face
8349293 these two factors will serve the industry well in riding out the current crisis
8349294 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8349295 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8349296 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8349297 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8349298 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8349299 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8349300 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8349301 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8349302 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8349303 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8349304 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8349305 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8349306 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8349307 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8349308 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8349309 it used to be an elite thing theyve taken street art and they make the galleries come to them i want to be like that
8349310 everyone from a senator can enjoy it to a bum on the street its available to everyone
8349311 were making more art for the people rather than the super high end stuff
8349312 they dont wear corporate logos for anybody theyre going to endorse obama the way they want
8349313 everyone wants to use their own voice to endorse obama
8349314 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8349315 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8349316 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8349317 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8349318 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8349319 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8349320 you must be the change you wish to see in the world
8349321 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8349322 if you want to teach english abroad heres what you need to know
8349323 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8349324 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8349325 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8349326 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8349327 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8349328 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8349329 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8349330 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8349331 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8349351 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8349352 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8349353 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8349354 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8349355 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8349356 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8349357 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8349358 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8349359 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8349360 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8349361 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8349362 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8349363 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8349364 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8349365 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8349366 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8349367 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8349368 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8349369 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8349370 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8349371 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510

8349377 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

8349481 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8349529 we have to wait until exactly the right moment take out the other three nukes without leaving an opportunity to detonate them that means we move when we learn he is going to launch the missiles not a moment before shoot down the missiles and their bombs arent a threat but we cant wait much after that because once the missiles are destroyed or reach their destination hell try to trigger the hostage bomb

8349641 most common belief was that the wealth of the world was more or less fixed and therefore that a person or a nation could grow wealthier only at the expense of another

8349643 wealth could be increased enormously through capital investment and through an increase in the supply and the efficiency of labor
8349644 wise and correct course to follow in taxation is not to destroy those who have already secured success but to create conditions under which everyone will have a better chance to be successful
8349645 being in the central valley its hard to avoid evidence of the foreclosure crisis especially in stockton and san joaquin county the number of foreclosures is startling and serves as an indication of the hardships many families are facing and the destabilizing effect in our communities

8349658 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the six point agreement
8349659 in accordance with united nations security council resolutions that remain in force abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognized borders of georgia and they must remain so
8349660 it simply means that the russian president continues not to honor the commitments that the russians have signed onto
8349661 in their response to speaker of the house nancy pelosi the us bishops commented on their interpretation of what speaker pelosi said not what she actually said
8349662 on conscience catholic politicians need no reminding that catholic teaching requires them to follow their own consciences even if it is in conflict with church teaching in addition
8349663 despite what many bishops might hope they cannot impose teachings on an unwilling faithful barely a fifth 22 of catholics in the us agree with the bishops that abortion should be completely illegal and catholic women in the us have abortions at the same rate as women in the population as a whole in fact while the bishops may seek to make abortion an election issue it is clear from a poll conducted by the noted washington dc firm belden russonello and stewart that many of the hierarchys teachings on reproductive health and rights have not been received by the faithful
8349664 ohchr calls on the indian authorities and in particular security forces to respect the right to freedom of assembly and expression and comply with international human rights principles in controlling the demonstrators
8349665 the use of force should be proportionate to the threat posed and firearms must only be used in dispersing a violent assembly to protect individuals against an imminent threat of death or serious injury
8349666 we thought it was so interesting to combine two opposite worlds
8349667 the u s open is known for being a red carpet extravaganza and we wanted to design something fresh and innovative with all the performance benefits maria needs to compete and look her best on the court
8349668 of course we are disappointed given the fact that this is one of marias favorite tournaments and given the accomplishments she has achieved in the past but were excited to bring marias inspiration and our collaboration with her to consumers who we hope will be just as excited about the u s open day and night dress collection
8349669 journalists have been beaten up by security personnel there is gross misuse of curfew rules to harass and intimidate journalists while editors and journalists are also constantly threatened by the opposing groups

8349671 the ifj condemns the assaults on the press in kashmir
8349672 the ifj is gravely concerned that in an environment of complete paralysis for the media rumour and disinformation will flourish aggravating an already bad situation
8349673 the ifj calls upon the authorities and the security agencies in kashmir to honour the well established convention that media accreditation cards are considered good for passage through curfew bound areas
8349674 we call on local authorities in kashmir to protect journalists covering the unrest
8349675 news about the conflict should be broadcast without restrictions on media outlets or reporters in the field
8349676 civilians have been forced to stay indoors by enforcing an indefinite curfew and even emergency services have not been exempted large scale arrests have been made in an attempt to muzzle the true political voice which represents the overwhelming sentiment and aspirations of the people of kashmir
8349677 the current crackdown by the security forces is against every basic tenet of international law and the concept of humanitarianism already reeling under the impact of an economic blockade the curfew has further accentuated the conditions and a humanitarian disaster is staring at our faces
8349678 the peaceful movement started by the people of kashmir has left indelible imprints and no amount of brute force would be able to stop it
8349679 indian state is fully aware of the extent of its unacceptability in kashmir and resorting to coercion and savagery will not be able to force the kashmiris into subjugation
8349680 1 when everyone will know that i was right or more likely 2 i will be dead and wont be around for the shame of my ego and illiteracy

8349768 its a very unusual situation where a company would be trying to compare its own drugs
8349769 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case
8349770 good news is that the board supports the proposed studies
8349771 the fact that we are comparing your drugs and you are not involved is very awkward and can easily give way to anti genentech sentiments
8349772 the leaders of this study are only interested in answering the many scientific and patient management questions that we face with our patients every day but some investigators and the press want this study to be more than that your involvement would be very helpful to both of our causes
8349773 our resources would be better spent looking at other diseases where there are no treatments
8349774 by fact that they didnt support the clinical study leads me to conclude that in reality there is no difference between the two drugs
8349775 i see this as a public health study not only for us but for the whole world it gives everyone the license to use both drugs interchangeably
8349776 clearly for medicare it would make economic sense to put preference on the use of avastin
8349777 it would surprise me if the contractors did not quickly use that concept

8349852 we do understand canadians frustration with fuel price volatility in particular but at the same time in our view thats the best evidence of a well functioning competitive market
8349853 in our view canadians are well served by a competitive marketplace and today they still pay the second lowest price for fuel in the western world
8349854 the oil companies are making huge profits when consumers are dinged at the pumps
8349855 its not the folks who are delivering fuel to canadians all over that are making money
8349856 at least 70 per cent of canadas gas stations see no benefit from rising prices but rather profits are declining as a result of increased credit card costs

8349888 the question of recognition of states is a matter for sovereign states to decide
8349889 the secretary general regrets that ongoing efforts to find a common solution on the way forward in the crisis in georgia within the security council may be complicated
8349890 we have no question about the sovereign independence of georgia but both south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to self determination under the charter of the united nations and other international instruments
8349891 we were making progress but frankly territorial integrity of georgia was an essential part of that and russias actions today have put a massive block in the way of achieving a common security council position
8349892 this decision is inconsistent with numerous united nations security council resolutions that russia has voted for in the past
8349893 it is also inconsistent with the french brokered six point ceasefire agreement which president medvedev signed
8349894 abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognised borders of georgia and they must remain so
8349895 the people of south ossetia and abkhazia have several times spoken out at referendums in favour of independence
8349896 it is our understanding that what has happened in tskhinval and what has been planned for abkhazia they have the right to decide their destiny by themselves

8349963 people are fed up with the ineffectiveness of sam sullivan peter ladner and the npa over the past three years

8349965 it has been brought to our attention that the ghillie brogue pattern we had acquired free through the historical re enactment community and was formerly posted here may have been copied from a copyrighted design owned and sold by www medieval moccasins com in order to honor their 1985 copyright we have removed the pattern from this site

8349986 has got to be true because even enemies agree on it
