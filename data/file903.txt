9030085 the simplest and quickest way to restore public trust in the cdc is for both democrats and republicans to put a commitment to end fluoridation into their party platforms
9030086 fluoridated water contains 250 times more fluoride than in mothers milk in 1950 when the public health service first endorsed fluoridation no studies had investigated possible adverse health effects today many published studies show fluoride is harmful but the cdc is ignoring these studies and continues its relentless promotion and funding of this outdated practice
9030087 this marking of the enamel indicates a child has been over exposed to fluoride we are concerned about how fluoride may be affecting the rest of the childs body over 20 studies show that fluoride can lower iq 4 5
9030088 it is clear that the cdcs oral health division is misleading the public about the safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation
9030089 they must be held accountable for this we need both political parties to resist the well heeled dental lobby our childrens health and the publics trust in government health agencies is at stake
9030090 while we have shown that the new probe can work for two types of procedures we believe that results will be more far reaching
9030091 there are many catheter based interventional procedures where 3 d ultrasound guidance could be used including heart valve replacements and placement of coils in the brain to prevent stroke wherever a catheter can go the probe can go
9030092 while the images obtained this way are good some patients experience adverse reactions to the contrast agent
9030093 also the images gained this way are fleeting the 3 d ultrasound guidance does not use x ray radiation or contrast agents and the images are real time and continuous
9030094 these tiny transducers work together to create one large transducer working much like the compound eyes of insects
9030095 i believe we have shown that 3 d ultrasound clearly works in a wide variety of interventional procedures
9030096 we envision a time in the not too distant future when this technology becomes standard equipment in various catheter kits
9030097 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
9030098 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
9030099 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
9030100 animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are so there is never any x ray advantage to forward facing eyes for them
9030101 because binocular vision does not help them see any better than monocular vision they are able to survey a much greater region with sideways facing eyes
9030102 this x ray vision makes it possible for animals with forward facing eyes to visually survey a much greater region around themselves than sideways facing eyes would allow
9030103 additionally the larger the animal in a cluttered environment the more forward facing its eyes will be to allow for the greatest x ray vision possible in order to aid in hunting running from predators and maneuvering through dense forest or jungle
9030104 in todays world humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle we arent faced with a great deal of small clutter and the things that do clutter our visual field cars and skyscrapers are much wider than the separation between our eyes so we cant use our x ray power to see through them
9030105 if we froze ourselves today and woke up a million years from now its possible that it might be difficult for us to look the new human population in the eyes because by then they might be facing sideways
9030106 our ice breaking research vessel polarstern is currently on a scientific mission in the arctic ocean departing from iceland the route has taken the ship through the northwest passage into the canadian basin where geophysical and geological studies will be carried out along profiles into the makarov basin to study the tectonic history and submarine geology of the central arctic ocean in addition oceanographic as well as biological studies will be carried out polarstern will circumnavigate the whole arctic ocean and exit through the northeast passage
9030107 the polar regions especially the arctic are very sensitive indicators of climate change the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change has shown that these regions are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures and predicted that the arctic would be virtually ice free in the summer months by 2070 other scientists claim it could become ice free as early as 2040 latest satellite observations suggest that the arctic could be mainly ice free even earlier
9030108 at awi we place particular emphasis on studying arctic sea ice and along with in situ studies of sea ice thickness change satellite data have been used extensively not only for the regular observation of changes in the arctic and antarctic but also for optimising the operation of polarstern in regions covered by sea ice

9030168 in such situations russian diplomats will have to leave georgia
9030169 would be very awkward to have a diplomatic relationship with russia when russia will be setting up diplomatic relations with south ossetia and abkhazia
9030170 the reasonable action to be undertaken was the cut off of diplomatic relations as a temporary measure after the end of the occupation of the territory we will see when and how that can be restored

9030196 judging by mccains track record of team building to date it is highly doubtful he will choose well
9030197 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of u s president
9030198 who knows if this claim is true he has not offered any tangible evidence
9030199 the global elites are laughing at how stupid the american people are

9030207 sarah palin is an exciting pick that has convinced me to support mccain after months of indecision
9030208 the selection of gov sarah palin as john mccains running mate underscores the point that this fall republicans will run as the true party of reform
9030209 she is a washington outsider a maverick who will put reform and results first for working families like mine she has spent her time in office shaking up government in alaska her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington i will actively campaign for john mccain and sarah palin and will proudly vote for them in november
9030210 gov palin has a proven record as a reformer who gets results and will feel at home within a mccain administration
9030211 i think it says a lot about john mccain and the changes that will be coming to washington d c with this presidency
9030212 not only is she inexperienced but she has no real standing which is one of the key things that republicans have been talking about over the course of this campaign theyre saying hes not qualified to be president well where is she coming from on that point
9030213 you have to remember that john mccain is going to be president thats the important factor the vice president isnt the president its a different pick
9030214 shes the governor of a state that has actually done things and accomplished things whereas the record with barack obama is quite the opposite hes been a state senator and a united states senator but he doesnt have a whole lot of accomplishments to go along with that

9030545 it just suddenly occurred to us that since people already tune in to be told by us how well convention speeches went they probably want to know more about us

9030705 we work pretty hard on our fitness even though both teams were waning at the end there it was a pretty torrid game a lot of turn over of possession probably not many free kicks which was surprising
9030706 we got ourselves into try scoring opportunities and once again just little mistakes cost us a chance to convert
9030707 its disappointing because we have worked hard in the last week on doing the right thing in that attacking zone but clearly weve got to do more work there
9030708 weve got to give a bit of credit to the opposition their defence was very strong they managed to slow our ball enough so they could get their defence into place and that puts us under pressure with our passing and catching
9030709 i thought ben smith had a fantastic game a young fella whos probably in his fourth or fifth game for otago and i thought he did tremendously well not only in retrieving the ball but kicking it down field
9030710 glen horton was again terrific we just have to create a bit more space for them so that they can score some tries
9030711 when dan bowden came on he started to probe and attack the line which gave us a bit of go forward that try was a lovely well taken try with the two of them acting in concert
9030712 vieram apenas validar uma banda que ao longo dos anos confirmou ter muito para oferecer
9030713 it would be quite dangerous for the bank of canada to start fooling around with that interest rate cuts because inflation is still sticky
9030714 credit growth is still fairly hot here so i think the bank would be playing with fire by cutting rates at this stage
9030715 over time it looks like growth is going to remain weak slack is going to build and the risk on inflation is tilting to the downside but i think its premature for the central bank to signal the all clear
9030716 the doors opening for a rate cut the risks have changed and shifted to the downside
9030717 may be the biggest single year line item veto total in state history
9030718 an exemplary life up until the time of the offenses and even after
9030719 judges dont like to be accused of making a mistake
9030720 the financials had a very good week particularly the earnings of the big six banks were definitely better than people were expecting so thats had a nice bid on the markets
9030721 and were going into a long weekend and im sure there are some people just straightening off their books before heading off
9030722 should be out in time for the holiday season on 24 hour service station
9030723 with both crude and total oil product inventories running significantly lower than they were when either hurricanes katrina or rita sidelined gulf oil production both oil and gasoline prices are more exposed to potential storm related supply disruptions than they were three years ago
9030724 a comparable hit to production could easily send gasoline prices to new record highs with pump prices in the united states rising to us 5 per gallon and send natural gas prices spiking as well
9030725 the question is whether demand destruction can keep pace with the destruction in supply
9030726 while supply disruptions and attendant price hikes will be temporary there will be lasting impacts from hurricane damage on future supply growth as there have already been from the 2005 storm season
9030727 the general trend to gasoline prices would be flat to slightly lower reflecting a sort of underlying slowing global growth and therefore a slowdown in demand for crude oil
9030728 that should take a further froth off crude oil prices and allow for gasoline prices to slip a bit further
9030729 if there is damage to infrastructure if rigs are offline for more than just a few days for precautionary reasons then you could see oil and gasoline prices move upward temporarily
9030730 however some of this strength reflects inventories built up ahead of the beijing olympics imports will likely fall off in september before picking up later in the year
9030731 the more listings there are on the market the bigger the impact on the average price
9030732 it means a market when buyers have more options and sellers must be realistic in their pricing expectations
9030733 the continuing rise in the number of new listings is resulting in a considerably more balanced resale housing market this year than buyers faced last year
9030734 this trend is most apparent in british columbia and saskatchewan which remained the most balanced provincial markets in july
9030735 the management of alitalia will remain in the hands of italians
9030736 prospective foreign partners will take a stake in the new company only as minority shareholders
9030737 therell be another one undoubtedly in the next couple of years but i also think well see some new ones starting up as well almost against common sense
9030738 i know that everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon because oil prices
9030739 i dont buy that because i can name two dozen airlines that have gone bankrupt in canada when oil was 20
9030740 while we are in the process of rebooking all of our customers affected by the closure of zoom airlines onto alternate flights we want our customers to know that we are a registered member of the bpcpa which will ensure they all get refunds for unused zoom airline tickets booked for today onwards
9030741 workers are the greatest treasure of the polish economy and there must be investment in human capital
9030742 jobs must be secure well managed decently paid and have honest retirement benefits which do not require elderly people to turn to social assistance
9030743 the dollar is up and so were seeing prices of crude move down from the highs remember that in 2005 the market sold off hard before hurricane katrinas arrival and then rallied again when it hit
9030744 right now there is still uncertainty on where exactly gustav will hit and so it is difficult to determine the damage that the storm might bring
9030745 it may be four days before it actually hits the gulf coast and the forecasts show a wide area where it may hit so some people are positioning some are repositioning ahead of the long weekend
9030746 if so and so is elected it will be like electing satan
9030747 all the heavy lifting would be done by this afternoon

9030763 one hundred flys always comes down to finishes and some would say cavics finish was it was at that point 50 50 whether you take another stroke or you take a glide
9030764 you see phelpsy took another stroke he cavic took a glide and obviously phelpss arms are coming over at a faster pace
9030765 he phelps made the right decision and the other guy made the wrong decision
9030766 but if he phelps had made the other decision he might not have been as lucky and he might have come away with a second and he would have come away with equaling spitzs record
9030767 im not saying he didnt deserve it im saying he did everything he could do to win those golds and he came away with it but at the same time there were little mistakes by other people that allowed him to do that
9030768 i guess what else is left to do for him except come down and win races he hasnt won before
9030769 when you are the greatest swimmer ever i guess you can afford to do that

9030778 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9030779 so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
9030780 now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable healthcare for every single american if you have healthcare my plan will lower your premiums if you dont youll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves
9030781 i will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick
9030782 when you put out over 1 billion without income targets you are going to skew the percentages heavily toward wealthier homeowners
9030783 in the industries i work in if you have something that critical you generally build more redundancy
9030784 if this faa outage happened at a power plant id be telling them to open up their checkbook and expect to be fined
9030785 dont happen on a mass scale or a regular basis
9030786 we are making sure people are getting from one place to another

9030789 weve resisted until now as we felt that the features of the eclipse public license epl were not unique enough to justify its inclusion this hasnt changed but how we think about licenses is getting a bit more nuanced
9030790 the population largely indifferent to these issues for generations are now all of a sudden realizing they have to do homework on their banks
9030791 it is interesting to see how consumers react because they are still waking up to this and banks really have to hammer home their capital position
9030792 i believe its extremely important for the people of jackson county mo to sit on the jury and decide this case
9030793 we are very happy to have the specter of the death penalty removed
9030794 i am not disappointed at all because i was the person from the very beginning saying that life in prison would be a just punishment for him
9030795 now there is blood lust for this man in the community
9030796 some of the attacks are just out and out false for example suggesting that the
9030797 this president has been unfairly attacked across the board by many democrats for quite a while
9030798 best qualified to be our next leader and commander in chief
9030799 do not expect the speech to define the presidents legacy
9030800 it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack
9030801 he knows what its like in high political season and hes not going to respond to every attack
9030802 je ne voulais pas aller au troisi me set je suis contente davoir gagn en deux sets a t elle indiqu je men suis tir e cest le plus important ce n tait pas une partie de plaisir en tout cas

9030805 all this criticism of raikonnen reminds me of when filippo inzaghi was at juventus if he did not score in three matches everyone said he was in crisis
9030806 he is motivated and we must work hard so that he is in a position to make a quick start especially on the new circuits which i dont like and are doing harm to formula one
9030807 you cant overtake and nine times out of 10 whoever takes pole position wins
9030808 i picked a couple of new ideas lets hope i can now surf ha ha
9030809 content is very useful and great to have a local product
9030810 i basically told george that i was involved in the company as a major investor
9030811 and wanted him to be aware of it in case the issue ever came up
9030812 simmons seemingly greased every palm in the statehouse to smooth his radioactive plans with his company waste control specialists giving more than 2 million in political cash since 2001 while spending 2 8 million on 63 lobby contracts according to texans for public justice
9030813 we reiterate our request that the department of justice fulfill its commitment to take prompt action to investigate and to prosecute the american issues project and we further request that the department of justice investigate and prosecute howard sic simmons for a knowing and willful violation of the individual aggregate contribution limits
9030814 political contributions are dwarfed by my charitable contributions of 400 million
9030815 a provision in the tax bill included at the behest of several members of congress including freshman rep kenny hulshof r mo would have granted simmons something both he and 2 000 beet farmers in oregon desired a graceful exit out of a joint venture deal that they had struck for the sole purpose of reducing or eliminating altogether a bill for 80 million in capital gains taxes simmons was facing
9030816 to avoid capital gains simmons came up with a cumbersome arrangement form a joint venture with the snake river sugar cooperative a group of 2 000 oregon beet farmers formed for this purpose and have the joint venture own the refinery and share the profits under the tax laws this arrangement was not technically a sale and simmons owed no capital gains taxes even though the cooperative paid him 260 million in the deal
9030817 the new legislation would not provide me any additional deferral above what i have already received
9030818 reports of an additional tax benefit to me are based on inaccurate information and are incorrect
9030819 i strongly urge you not to use this important tool at this time
9030820 this is a vendetta against harold simmons and thats sad
9030821 they tried to shoot harold simmons and instead they shot our 2 000 growers
9030822 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
9030823 a bold rescue is good news for colombia and canada
9030824 colombia has moved a long way from those grisly days when judges mayors police officers and other symbols of authority were targeted by the farc while paramilitaries targeted unionists teachers and others
9030825 were talking about the regime with the worst human rights record in the continent and the army with the worst human rights record in the continent with the greatest us support including the contractors or mercenaries so the fact that this regime was involved in this liberation does not and should not and can not cover up the fact that it is a horrendous regime
9030826 quickpwn is not a replacement for pwnagetool they are different tools and provide different features quickpwn is for quickly pwning a device whereas pwnagetool is designed to custom build and tailor the ipsw production process both tools will be actively developed in the future
9030827 we are disappointed think the jury is wrong and we will be appealing
9030828 we have a great track record of bringing substance with splash
9030829 you expect people to respond by organizing a protest and throwing their fists in the air and you also expect people to respond by flying 1 000 american flags
9030830 and those are two legitimate ways to respond to politics but there is a whole in between area that doesnt get talked about
9030831 exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9030832 if you took a poll of reporters and legislators i expect her approval rating would be down in the teens or twenties
9030833 i believe that a country russia in this case that can enable its citizens to maintain their honor and dignity protect their lives and fulfill its international legal commitments will not be isolated
9030834 europe and the united states are not the whole world
9030835 if european states want to serve the foreign policy interests of the united states i do not think they will gain anything thereby
9030836 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9030837 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9030838 a strategic free software utilization in public administration could create thousands of jobs as well as a significant decrease in software licensing costs however quebecs public administration refuses to even consider and evaluate these options
9030839 while most of the developed countries have started a few years back migrating their technological infrastructures to free software quebecs public administration is far behind
9030840 in the industries i work in if you have something that critical you generally build more redundancy
9030841 if this faa outage happened at a power plant id be telling them to open up their checkbook and expect to be fined
9030842 dont happen on a mass scale or a regular basis

9030847 some scientists believe that an extreme cooling episode potentially a mini ice age is imminent others think that it may already be under way this involves natural factors most notably the sun and earths oceans we at the almanac are among those who believe that sunspot cycles and their effects on oceans correlate with climate changes studying these and other factors suggests that a cold not warm climate may be in our future

9030892 based upon our polling in key battleground states in 2007 and early 2008 all indicators pointed to john mccain as the only plausible republican presidential nominee
9030893 our polling showed that mccain was the second choice of the other candidates supporters particularly in florida which really made mccains nomination possible our polling in 2008 have shown that barack obama underperforms among female voters particularly in the states of ohio michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin that provides an opening for senator mccain
9030894 additionally john mccain has a unique opportunity to present the future of the republican party in his vice presidential selection

9030902 once again tune into politics and karma will once again prove to be a total pain for barack obama and the party elders of the undemocratic democratic party
9030903 barack obama should have begged hillary rodham clinton to be on his democratic ticket john mccain may well be about to bring that chilling fact home to barack obama
9030904 all that said she doesnt have much foreign policy or any other governing experience which puts a dent in mccains argument that experience is everything but yeah this was a smart choice on mccains part damn
9030905 vote for mccain is no longer a protest vote i want bumper stickers
9030906 this makes it impossible for senator mccain to criticize senator obama for his lack of experience ever again
9030907 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
9030908 i am elated with senator mccains selection of governor sarah palin for vice president
9030909 governor palin brings a vibrant spirit uncompromising principles a deeply rooted value of family and children and a record of fearless determination in reforming the broken systems of government that will help to bring exactly the kind of change to washington that the american people need and have every right to expect

9030945 i wanted to make the film and the facts about the occupation of iraq accessible to a larger group of people my hope is that this will contribute to the process of making better foreign policy decisions moving forward in iraq and elsewhere during this election year its important to examine the leadership mentality and policies that caused iraq to descend into such a horrific state that after 4 000 american deaths at least a quarter million iraqis killed 4 million refugees and over 2 trillion spent iraq remains in a state of near collapse

9030947 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity

9030970 now that we have an accurate way to count these cells we are able to confirm what we long suspected that blacks might have a bigger army of hla specific b cells
9030971 if the recipient is not sensitized b cells represent only a patients potential for making antibodies
9030972 however about a third of patients in need of a kidney are sensitized since theyre often on their second or third transplantation and may have undergone transfusions
9030973 knowing that blacks have an increased number of hla specific b cells which increases their opportunity for antibody mediated rejection we may be able to customize treatments for black recipients to account for these differences and lessen the likelihood that the organ will be rejected
9030974 razia sengaja kami gelar menjelang ramadan tujuannya selain menghormati umat muslim menjalankan ibadah juga mengantisipasi adanya gangguan kamtibmas saat bulan ramadan nanti
9030975 razia ini digelar sesuai dengan hasil kesepakatan bersama muspika yang digelar satu hari sebelumnya dan harapannya para pemilik tempat hiburan ataupun hotel dan para pedagang miras siap menaati
9030976 kita harap satu bulan ini bisa selesai pansus amat membutuhkan dukungan seluruh pihak
9030977 draft ini sudah amat matang memang kewajiban terberat bakal dipikul dinkes
9030978 setelah itu kami akan kedatangan armada baru seri 500 dan seri 800 yang disebut sebut sebagai next generation
9030979 tetapi dengan tergelincirnya satu pesawat di jambi rabu 27 8 berarti tinggal 14 unit
9030980 malang akan mendapat jatah untuk seri 500 karena pesawatnya tidak terlalu besar dan cocok dengan kondisi di bandara abd saleh
9030981 tahun lalu otoman ub menjadi juara umum tahun ini setidaknya kami harus bisa mempertahankan gelar juara
9030982 yang terpenting dalam kontes ini bagaimana menguasai angin seninya waktu roket ini terbang
9030983 dari agen memang net bersih rp 69 ribu untuk sampai di sini kami juga pesan sehingga ada biaya tambahan transportasi
9030984 masih harga rp 75 ribu pasarannya memang segitu setelah ada kenaikan harga elpiji
9030985 tidak ada namanya harga kesepakatan yang berlaku harga ketetapan pertamina
9030986 ingat radiusnya 60 kilometer ini menjangkau seluruh kota malang kota batu dan sebagian kabupaten malang
9030987 pertamina sangat ketat di agen urusan pengecer agen juga harus memberi penjelasan
9030988 tidak ada harga liar yang berlaku hanya rp 69 000 untuk tabung 12 kg dan lainnya seperti ditetapkan surat keputusan direksi pemasaran niaga
9030989 saya rasa mengambil untung rp 1 000 atau rp 2 000 tak masalah sebab toko toko juga mengeluarkan transport
9030990 kontrol harga akan dilakukan bersama dengan pemkot malang dan ini tidak bisa langsung karena baru rabu 27 8 diputuskan
9030991 langkah ini terhambat karena belum ada surat edaran resmi dari pertamina tentang kenaikan harga
9030992 untuk menaikkan harga jual mengikuti harga bahan jelas tidak mungkin sehingga produsen mebel saat ini banyak yang mengatasinya dengan mengganti bahan contohnya jika biasanya produsen menggunakan spon kualitas a kini untuk produk yang sama digunakan spon b
9030993 diantaranya set kursi untuk ruang tamu mebel seperti tempat tidur dan lemari juga banyak terjual di saat lebaran warga ingin menjamu tamunya dengan sebaik mungkin salah satunya ditunjukkan dengan menyediakan mebel yang sekaligus merupakan prestis atau kebanggan

9031016 dari ikadin sebelum pecah red waktu itu yang bersama sama menghadap notaris untuk menandatangani pernyataan pendirian peradi adalah saya dan dr otto hasibuhan sh sekarang ketua umum peradi red
9031017 ketika di peradi saya duduk sebagai wakil ketua umum dan saat itu kami sudah berulangkali mengingatkan otto hasibuhan ketua umum peradi untuk segera mengadakan munas advokat sesuai amanat uu namun otto tak pernah menggubris justru keliling membentuk cabang cabang karena itulah saya keluar dari peradi kemudian bersama teman teman mengadakan konggres yang melahirkan kai sebagai wadah tunggal advokat
9031018 kalau ada perbedaan dalam rumah tangga sesuatu hal yang wajar saya kalau tidak cocok lebih baik saya diam dan mengikuti kegiatan lainnya kembali ke rumah sudah dapat mesra mesraan lagi
9031019 biasanya pasangan muda itu hanya mengerti yang indah indahnya saja padahal rumah tangga itu tidak semuanya indah perlu ada pemahaman yang sama antara suami dan istri tentang hak dan kewajibannya

9031025 ini pasti dilakukan pejabat penting kasus ini harus segera dibongkar karena selama ini bagian kepegawaian dan badan pengawas tidak mampu melacaknya secara tuntas
9031026 kami yakin kasus ini sudah menyebabkan uang rakyat ratusan juta mengalir secara rutin ke kantong oknum pejabat bagi kami ini sudah masuk ranah penyidikan dugaan tindak pidana korupsi
9031027 kami berharap oknum pejabat yang selama ini merasa aman memakan uang rakyat dari gaji para honorer fiktif itu segera ditangkap dan diadili
9031028 kasus seperti ini tidak boleh dibiarkan ini kasus pidana yang nantinya akan menjerat juga pejabat yang mencairkan gaji itu kalau indikasi ini kuat kami berharap kejari bisa memproses kasus ini secepatnya

9031057 they were really bumpy all you could do is hit a good stroke and hope it was really really disappointing

9031063 john mccains selection of sarah palin as his running mate may have been a calculated political risk but much more importantly its an even greater risk for the american people
9031064 while well certainly learn more about sarah palin in the coming days and weeks heres what we know already like john mccain palin is strongly anti choice closely tied with big oil and the nra and committed to continuing the failed bush economic policies of the last eight years
9031065 youve got a governor who has raised more special interest contributions than any politician in california history and is holding five and six figure fundraisers across the street from the capitol and hes criticizing people who are trying to thwart his political agenda

9031072 there is now great industry support behind blu ray and the format is moving forward with enhancements that move beyond high definition such as the bd live spec that integrates internet connectivity options with the disc
9031073 the reality is that when you start with standard definition theres only so much you can do to it to make it look better at a higher resolution
9031074 the best upscaling technology in the world cant make average quality standard definition content look like high quality hd content because the content just isnt there

9031083 i couldnt be more excited about getting in lucas oil stadium i continually take the opportunity to thank so many people our players and
9031084 i look at it like its the eighth wonder of the world its just really special to be part of this community to see what it was like in 1984 to be all around the greater indianapolis area and to see how it has changed we couldnt be more excited
9031085 its a culmination of so many dreams when jim and i first got together 11 years ago our goal was to win a super bowl multiple super bowls be a competitive team in the national football league every year and hopefully to solidify the future of the franchise here in indianapolis all of that has been done
9031086 it is one thing committed dedicated football people as owners
9031087 thats where it all starts in many ways thats where it starts and ends we are very fortunate to have a dedicated football man in our owner in jim irsay thats the single biggest reason why we win
9031088 im not sure that 10 6 could not be a team that can win the super bowl
9031089 its a long way to go and perseverance is the watchword we have to fight through a lot of hurdles but we have the manpower and the leadership and the courage to do it im sure
9031090 i like where we are in terms of team unity thats always important to me i think the guys who were here last year were disappointed by that loss to san diego in the playoffs we felt like we went a long way and did not play our best at the end we worked hard since that game and are excited to come out and see if we can get ourselves back in that position and finish the season up right
9031091 for me its about winning and winning the right way
9031092 depende muito da evolu o das commodities que uma coisa imprevis vel

9031099 evangelism such as tdd has become so overbearing that it makes unit testing as a whole unappealing
9031100 developers write hundreds of small tests for exercising their own code
9031101 how do i write a unit test for an application that has more dependencies on external systems than i have figures on both my hands it would take me longer to handle the dependencies than to just code the feature
9031102 has become so overbearing that it makes unit testing as a whole unappealing
9031103 i woke up in the morning and said was that a dream
9031104 dont worry we are pulling this group back into apple so that we can invest even more sales and marketing resources into these products rather than dumping the products into a small spin off which lacks such resources
9031105 not received any photos from parents who claim their child looks like senator john mccain
9031106 so maybe she is nothing more than a full on political opportunist putting her childs life at risk for a speech seems pretty slimy to me
9031107 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president
9031108 i guess this is supposedly the older wiser john mccain
9031109 is this now not just more lying he knows ambition has been his motive so he accuses obama of it
9031110 im not aware of many or any presidential candidates who were not ambitious to try to pretend really that he is without ambition i dont think anybodys going to buy that
9031111 is there something unseemly about returning to this well in such a dishonest fashion
9031112 does it say anything about mccains approach to the issues of race
9031113 weve got samples pending from a couple other premises that just have horses linked to the index premises
9031114 i can tell you the tattoos are helping us a lot
9031115 most of these horses theyre racing are directly off quarter horse tracks so we can use that to confirm what theyre telling us
9031116 were trying to do trace outs and find any links and really direct epidemiological connections to these positive horses were following those out and getting those horses quarantined and tested and trying to get good histories on those horses to find out where they came from and what the source might be where the initial infection came from
9031117 i think the risk of other diseases is much more significant than this eastern equine encephalitis which were seeing a decent amount of cases here in florida and all those other diseases that are endemic

9031119 the plane that once had an american flag on its tail now sports the obama
9031120 is this a fashion statement those have been on politicians since sept 12 2001
9031121 the truth is that right after 9 11 i had a pin
9031122 shortly after 9 11 particularly because as were talking about the iraq war that became a substitute for i think true patriotism which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security
9031123 i decided i wont wear that pin on my chest
9031124 instead im gonna try to tell the american people what i believe what will make this country great and hopefully that will be a testimony to my patriotism
9031125 somebody noticed i wasnt wearing a flag lapel pin and i told folks well you know what
9031126 my attitude is that im less concerned about what youre wearing on your lapel than whats in your heart and you show your patriotism by how you treat your fellow americans especially those who served you show your patriotism by being true to our values and our ideals and thats what we have to lead with is our values and our ideals

9031424 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas

9031426 exigimos de la autoridad un alto a la represi n
9031427 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
9031428 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
9031429 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
9031430 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
9031431 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
9031432 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
9031433 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
9031434 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

9031552 humanitarian food assistance relief recovery and development childcare and protection and the rights of people with disabilities
9031553 the majority support the opposition the mdc and the majority are being starved by the government
9031554 we welcome this announcement as the humanitarian crisis in zimbabwe needs urgent attention
9031555 without the immediate resumption of food aid across the country widespread hunger and worsening malnutrition will be unavoidable
9031556 we hope that these modalities will not involve restrictions on aid agencies or local civil society
9031557 fighter jets struck the militants hideouts in peochar killing 22
9031558 their command and communications structure has also been destroyed this was their key area where they had set up ammunition depots which were also demolished
9031559 this strike was carried out after intelligence that top taliban cleric mullah fazlullah was hiding there
9031560 it was a good way to finish the series but the indians played well and deserved to win it
9031561 credit goes to the boys for the way we came back we kept making mistakes through the series we were not consistent in the batting department
9031562 it was good to win the series with a game to spare
9031563 these tracks are said to be slow but the bounce has improved over the last few years i am happy with the way our batsmen have played the spin it was important to keep the strike rotating and our batsmen did that well
9031564 i just want to finish the season have fun and win the races
9031565 first and foremost the wallabies have got to meet whats obviously going to come the other way and its going to be significant
9031566 last week we were able to deny early some of that pressure and that will be important again because there will be some significant challenges coming at us
9031567 if you dont cope with them then all of a sudden youve got a different contest
9031568 i suspect there will be a distinct approach and ellis park lends itself to that anyway
9031569 across the park theyve obviously been very disappointing with the way theyve gone over the last couple of games but its their last hit out in the tri nations its ellis park theyll throw everything at us
9031570 were certainly not reading too much into their last couple of performances we know it will be a different team on saturday afternoon and if were not up for the game then theyll really put the sword into us
9031571 if you are inaccurate and you turn over possession the opposition has the ability to move you from one end of the ground to the other a bit quicker and with greater ease
9031572 so you wont want to be turning over ball or ill discipline for that matter because it adds another 10 metres on the kicking range
9031573 as the season winds down were hoping to provide an opportunity to families particularly who may have already been to the ballpark before and want to come back before the end of the season
9031574 were certainly very cognizant of peoples budgets and the fact that their entertainment dollar may be stretched thin now
9031575 i will not quit at this moment i will not declare emergency rule i will wait and see tomorrow
9031576 police will still adhere to my earlier order they merely went to post a court order not to clear protesters
9031577 there will be no coup because a coup will not be able to solve the problems
9031578 i am confident that police are able to oversee the situation
9031579 there are now up to 3 000 police deployed outside government house
9031580 i am convinced that the military will not forcibly crack down on us
9031581 pad must go ahead and intensify the protest we think that more unions will join us and it will lead to more airport closures
9031582 beautiful code represents an idea and the underlying logic exists only to support that idea
9031583 i think what you see is companies looking to upgrade their facilities
9031584 new york is not much closer to a statewide network today than it was when this whole process started
9031585 after three rounds of failed testing it is apparent that this system is not ready to move forward
9031586 even if the system is fixed our audit of erie county demonstrates that localities should seriously look at alternatives to the statewide wireless network
9031587 if something goes wrong and you pout or get upset and people see it then they are going to be uncomfortable
9031588 we are the busiest weve ever been period all four services all of our instructors have done multiple deployments
9031589 the op tempo is going going going we bring the veterans here because they have the knowledge of whats going on in theater we also try to give them time to decompress
9031590 it is inherently a physical exercise but its also intellectual
9031591 if you are in 80 pounds of kevlar and ceramic plates it will take its toll on you
9031592 its like a workout you are soaked in sweat and your ability to think and act is inhibited its something you have to work through the physical exhaustion and the heat
9031593 there is no likelihood that mr jews will succeed in his federal action
9031594 this was surprising a total surprise this was not one of the people everyone had expected so well have to start over with the research to get to know her i hope it turns out to be a positive selection it certainly has added a large degree of interest to the campaign
9031595 this is the most critical election for americans in more than a generation
9031596 instead of choosing a running mate who has the experience to be a real partner in bringing change to this country john mccain made a political pick in an attempt to reverse the anxiety republicans are feeling about his campaign rather than reversing the anxiety working families have about their future and their childrens future
9031597 its great its bold its something thats long overdue this woman has credentials that are amazing shes really tough and she has a fantastic record of leading alaska
9031598 her experience has been at the state and local level where the people are she knows what the issues and problems are for people out there in the small towns and cities shes connected with them for years
9031599 im really not sure i dont know much about her im glad it wasnt a few other people ive heard mentioned im really going to have to find out more about her and see what shes all about
9031600 id heard her name in the news being bantered around but i thought from what id heard that it was unlikely
9031601 as a woman as a younger person as a family person being out of the west it has some fascinating dynamics to it
9031602 shes not an arch conservative you cant be and be governor of alaska thats an independent state shes a middle of the roader
9031603 she needs to get vetted and the media will vet her everything shes done everything shes said i dont know anything about sarah palin before 1990 i dont know if theres a lot of history there so everybody will be very very suspicious until that vetting takes place
9031604 thanks its not like i have hearing loss or anything

9031618 south east asia has plummeted to levels it took europe 150 years to reach in just 30 years
9031619 the span of fertility across countries has never been wider
9031620 both extremes cause their own problems if europe continues at 1 5 the population will halve every 65 years if africa continues with half its population under 15 it will continue to consume more than it produces making it harder to escape from poverty and illiteracy
9031621 people are very bad at calculating survival probabilities twenty years ago fertility started to decline in nepal and bangladesh when they were still poor korea wasnt rich when fertility declined by contrast the gulf oil states continued with high birthrates long after they got huge wealth
9031622 in africa most women work in agriculture around the home
9031623 but in bangladesh women get out and meet other women at work who may be using contraception getting outside the home fixes a new social norm prosperity and fertility are interlinked in a chicken and egg way
9031624 food sex and procreation are core elements of humanity and changes to them are often met with fierce hostility
9031625 in my view the evidence is that there is something intrinsic to the culture its there in the rich muslim states in the gulf in saudi arabia and in the muslim provinces of the former soviet union it is perhaps bound up with the status of women
9031626 not just in catholic spain and italy but in orthodox greece the strong traditions are not boosting fertility rate as many might suppose

9031645 the operation in the warehouse was amazing there were rows and rows of kennels stacked two high as far as you could see probably 100 volunteers tended to the dogs cleaning crates washing bowls getting the dogs checked out by several veterinarians on the scene and then moving them out to various rescues as soon as we loaded a dog the kennel was cleaned and disinfected
9031646 our priority is the care of these dogs so please be patient and allow our volunteers extra time to respond email is the best method to communicate with us in addition to caring for the dogs most of our members have other full time jobs too we do not have a central facility or telephone number so generally the callers are getting our cell phones we simply refer them back to the website for more information and we will try to post any updates on these dogs

9031649 etc now some obama supporters are turning around and using their defense as an argument against palin
9031650 governor palin is a vice presidential selection which shows that john mccain at the age of 72 today is still able to think outside the box governor palin will delight the republican base she is pro life it appears that senator obama played it safe in picking senator biden and senator mccain made the bold and unconventional choice in picking governor palin
9031651 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country

9031743 while both types of pain can hurt very much at the time they occur social pain has the unique ability to come back over and over again whereas physical pain lingers only as an awareness that it was indeed at one time painful

9031764 one of the central issues in nanotechnology is the development of simple and reliable methods to precisely arrange molecules and other nanoscopic objects one promising route intensively investigated by scientists around the world involves the ability of molecules to spontaneously assemble onto a surface what we have done is successfully combined two strategies which are complementary but so far have been explored independently and it is this combination which opens up unprecedented opportunities for accessing the ultrasmall length scale
9031765 the potential of this approach lies in its flexibility on a scale about 1 10000 of the diameter of a human hair using molecules as building units the features of our structures are less than 5 nanometres in size which enables us to control structures and materials at dimensions where new properties emerge
9031766 we are just at the beginning of the exploration of a very exciting new area ongoing and future work will investigate changes in the dimensions and geometry of the network where the aim is to get exact control over the arrangement of molecules ultimately at the level of single molecules
9031767 in the short term this development provides us with an easily accessible platform for fundamental studies of phenomena on the ultrasmall scale
9031768 in the future we might be able to use this technology for the assembly of nanomachines molecular devices used to transport and manipulate molecules and nanometer sized objects

9031780 siccome si potrebbe perdere il referendum allora che si dice io non lo faccio osserva di pietro parlando del pd come quello che dice visto che potrei morire mi sparo una fucilata
9031781 io credo prosegue che oggi ci sia un terreno di sfiducia nei cittadini ma ci sono battaglie di principio che vanno fatte per ripulire il terreno da questa sfiducia qualcuno deve cominciare a farlo se nessuno comincia mai allora non si arriva mai a destinazione
9031782 come si pu pensare che nel pd ci sia qualcuno a favore del lodo alfano dellimmunit al presidente del consiglio
9031783 raccogliere 500 mila firme non un problema ma raggiungere il quorum lo e negli ultimi anni i promotori hanno sempre perso i referendum a noi non serve una battaglia minoritaria
9031784 se proprio volevi che il pd contribuisse alla raccolta delle firme per il referendum almeno una telefonata la potevi fare per dircelo visto che lo abbiamo saputo dalle tv altrimenti viene il sospetto che si interessati pi ad accendere i riflettori su se stessi che a fare una battaglia di lungo periodo
9031785 ci siano sfumature diverse nel modo di fare opposizione piaccia o non piaccia pd e idv hanno bisogno luno dellaltro per vincere
9031786 non ho mai pensato osserva che vocazione maggioritaria volesse dire solitudine che in alcune circostanze non ci si pu permettere siamo un partito del 33 che arriva al 38 con lidv o riusciamo in una notte ad avere una legge cos maggioritaria che ci d il 51 ma non mi pare che sia a portata di mano oppure ci dobbiamo preoccupare di ricostruire un polo di alleanza
9031787 penso che dobbiamo porci il problema dei rapporti con la sinistra radicale anche se so bene che i risultati del congresso di rifondazione sembrano non aiutare
9031788 ludc mi sembra pi preoccupata di alzare il prezzo del rapporto con il centrodestra che non di costruire un rapporto serio con il pd

9031791 e normale ribadisce belpietro lho sempre fatto lho fatto anche per quelle che riguardavano altre parti politiche lo faccio anche adesso e continuer a farlo finch sar consentito di farlo tutte le volte che pubblichiamo qualcosa che riguarda un politico c qualcuno che strilla al complotto se cos se ci fosse un complotto facciano allora una legge e la facciano finita con questa storia delle intercettazioni ci ha provato mastella ora ci prova berlusconi per ora una legge non c e io continuo a fare il mio mestiere che quello di informare
9031792 non mi sono mai consultato con berlusconi e non ho mai pubblicato una notizia per sostenere complotti politici di qualsiasi natura non consulto berlusconi e non saprei perch dovrei farlo non ho mai consultato non solo i miei editori che sono stati svariati nel corso degli anni ho sempre deciso autonomamente che cosa pubblicare non vedo perch dovrei consultare uno degli azionisti della casa editrice per la quale lavoro non lho detto al presidente e neppure alla d anche loro come tutti gli altri hanno letto le intercettazioni questa mattina su panorama

9031795 yahoos new social network mash is appropriately named it feels like a mash up of facebook myspace and wikipedia its taken the best or at least most popular features from these services and put them together in a very compelling social service i strongly doubt it will suffer the same fate of that other social network the failing yahoo 360
9031796 yahoo mash never really caught on but it did have some loyal followers
9031797 part of the problem was that the site did little to distinguish itself from the social networking crowd or attract young people its biggest feature was that instead of inviting your friends to join you could instead create profiles for them and then encourage them to adopt the profile and customize it this kind of approach was perceived by some to be somewhat invasive

9031836 if youre ever going to win the european cup then this is the day and this is the place but we dont just want to win this cup we want to do it playing good football to make neutrals glad weve won it glad to remember how we did it
9031837 but to be honest i thought wed get a right gubbin
9031838 and theres us midgets ahve got nae teeth bobby lennox hasnae any either and old ronnie simpson s got the full monty nae teeth top and bottom the italians are starin doon at us and were grinnin back up at em wi our great gumsy grins we must have looked like something oot o the circus
9031839 if youre ever going to win the european cup then this is the day and this is the place but we dont just want to win this cup we want to do it playing good football to make neutrals glad weve won it glad to remember how we did it
9031840 tell me the 9 oclock and 10 oclock mass are all ticket
9031841 i am now going to tell him herrera how celtic will be the first team to bring the european cup back to britain but it will not help him in any manner shape or form we are going to attack as we have never attacked before cups are not won by individuals but by men in a team who put their club before personal prestige i am lucky i have the players who do just that for celtic
9031842 we must play as if there are no more games no more tomorrows
9031843 we dont just want to win the european cup we want to do it playing good football to make neutrals glad we won it please to remember how we did it
9031844 come here youve made history go out and play to you capability and enjoy yourself
9031845 we did it by playing football pure beautiful inventive football
9031846 there is not a prouder man on gods earth than me at this moment winning was important aye but it was the way that we have won that has filled me with satisfaction we did it by playing football pure beautiful inventive football there was not a negative thought in our heads inter played right into our hands its so sad to see such gifted players shackled by a system that restricts their freedom to think and to act our fans would never accept that sort of sterile approach our objective is always to try to win with style
9031847 we hope that the next hands on the european cup are yours
9031848 rangers or celtic my first feeling was celtic when i was 13 years old i saw for the first time in my life a european cup final inter against celtic that image is even today clear in my mind that day that game jimmy johnston riva i was so impressed when i was in mozambique far away from football in europe i always remembered that day and that team especially because when they started to play in the national stadium in portugal i thought celtic were sporting lisbon because they dressed like sporting
9031849 at the beginning of the season i dont really think the european cup was on our horizon at all to be fair
9031850 once we got by the first stage of the european cup people started looking up and saying theres a team in scotland that seems to be doing well
9031851 when celtic got through we just couldnt believe that our team was going to play in the european cup final
9031852 who had ever heard of a team of local boys from glasgow getting to the european cup final
9031853 i think they had won the european cup twice in the previous three years and they had also won the world club championship they had a lot of good players
9031854 there had been nothing seen like the contingent that went out to lisbon
9031855 i saw on the news that the fans were leaving by car and coach and thats when it really got to me that i had to be there
9031856 i had been due to travel out on a charter flight that a local pub had been running but they overbooked the plane and i was one of the people they let down
9031857 i was sitting in my house a week ahead of the game desperately wanting to go when i had a brainstorm
9031858 for about four or five days before we left glasgow for lisbon we had been down at seamill which was a hotel down the ayreshire coast that we would use for training
9031859 jock stein had been invited out to milan a few years earlier to watch herreras methods of training
9031860 we knew about facchetti and all these guys they were great players mazzola bicicli burgnich they were all top men at the time
9031861 i was a bookmaker at the time and id made celtic favourites to win the final which was ridiculous
9031862 as fans we werent afraid of inter because we knew little or nothing about european football
9031863 we went to lisbon early on the tuesday morning and the game was on the thursday
9031864 jock was always a move in front of everybody else and he would have done that to upset herrera
9031865 herrera was trying to get the portuguese to support inter milan but i think most of them came for the underdogs and supported us which was great for us but we had a massive support with us anyway
9031866 we were the underdogs by a mile but we were a team full of confidence in our own ability and teamwork plus we had an excellent manager who prompted us all the time and made sure our feet were on the ground
9031867 celtic fans knew that they had a chance because the team didnt play like everybody else
9031868 on the wednesday morning we did a training session at the stadium
9031869 we thought they were having a good laugh at us that we were a nothing team
9031870 we stayed in a hotel called the pal cio in estoril and it was absolutely wonderful
9031871 i was very friendly with jock stein and i knew a lot of the players
9031872 we were so relaxed on the night before the game
9031873 on the way back the trainer neil mochan took us on a short cut but it came to a dead end and we had to climb over a fence
9031874 when we got back to the hotel we had a wee cup of tea as usual
9031875 it was a holy day of obligation and youre supposed to go to mass
9031876 a friend of ours father bertie oreagan was in lisbon and when jock stein found out it was a religious day he asked him if he would he say mass for the players who had to go
9031877 there were four non catholics in the team ronnie simpson tommy gemmell willie wallace and bertie auld and they obviously didnt go to church but they didnt think anything of it because it often happened when we were playing away and they would just make a joke about it
9031878 it was important because a lot of the lads were good living and religion was an important aspect of their lives but it was also good because it ate into the morning and it gave us something to concentrate on
9031879 the majority of celtic fans were catholics so the chapels were packed with fans and i think it helped win over the lisbon people
9031880 it was the first time id been abroad and when i arrived in lisbon all the celtic fans were gathered in the plaza in the city centre but who was the first face i saw but john mccabe and he still had my scarf wrapped round his neck
9031881 the kick off was at five oclock so when we got back to the hotel we had our lunch and got away to our beds and spent the afternoon resting
9031882 he told us was that we had a chance to make history that the opportunity was there and the platform was there for each and every one of us to make history
9031883 on the way to the stadium i think the coach driver went the wrong way but we were at the back of the bus singing songs so we wouldnt have particularly noticed anyway
9031884 the stadium was set in a national park and it was chaos around the ground but we got there eventually and i think sometimes things like take your mind off the game and you can relax
9031885 we arrived 50 minutes before kick off which suited us perfectly
9031886 i flew in just for in time for the match
9031887 when i first saw the stadium i thought it was spectacular
9031888 jock could usually be like anything with the players depending on what side of the bed he had got out of but before that game he was wonderful
9031889 we came out of the dressing room and through a courtyard before going into a long tunnel
9031890 they must have got the shock of their lives how do you deal with a team singing a football song seconds before they walk out to play in a big game
9031891 the next thing we were up the steps and suddenly the green and white scarves went up from the big celtic support
9031892 the biggest thing i had to do as captain was in illustrating to the team that we had nothing to fear
9031893 right after kick off bicicli ran past me and planted a kiss on the side of my cheek and then just carried on
9031894 in those days the italians played very defensively and they marked man to man
9031895 there was a kind of calmness amongst the fans before the game that was shattered in the seventh minute when the penalty was given
9031896 with catenaccio in vogue then the worst thing we wanted to do was concede an early goal
9031897 with just seven minutes gone i thought it was never a penalty but when you look at it now it was
9031898 there was a sinking feeling among the fans when inter scored but a chorus of hail hail went up and the whole crowd just started to lift themselves again and we knew it was just a matter of time until celtic were going to score
9031899 before the game wed heard that sarti the goalkeeper was the weak link in the inter team but he was absolutely great for them
9031900 jock had told us that inter were a team who would want us to come to them all the time and the more you come to them the more youve got to be on your toes because they liked to hit you on the break
9031901 celtic were playing the game like they were down at barrowfields where they trained
9031902 at half time jock stein calmed us down just a little bit because we all thought that the referee had done us in just a little bit by the penalty kick
9031903 i was with this feller who was bursting for the toilet at half time
9031904 big jock had a theory and i know this from talking to him
9031905 the two full backs had got up the park at the same time which shouldnt really have happened but just shows how much we were on top
9031906 the ball was passed back from craig to tommy gemmell and the next thing the ball was in the back of the net through about eight milan players
9031907 when tommy gemmells goal went in it was probably one of the most beautiful goals that youll ever see in a european cup final
9031908 i jumped up and a portuguese chap in a celtic scarf got hold of me and he was shouting celtic celtic
9031909 when the ball went in we all jumped on top of big tommy
9031910 if wed have got beaten wed have got credit for going there and putting up a good performance but i didnt feel as if we were in awe of these people we really took the game to them and let them worry about it
9031911 in the 83rd minute bobby murdoch hit a tremendous shot across goal
9031912 people say that was quite lucky but jock stein had us working on that move at least three times a week
9031913 stevie must have done that a thousand times in training the ball came through and he pushed it in the corner of the net
9031914 after we scored the second goal i was convinced that we would be up against it so i said to john clark this is when weve got to win this weve got to play but they didnt
9031915 i remember jimmy johnstone running down time at the end of the game and he took the ball for a walk
9031916 ill never forget the final whistle i was in the centre circle near john clark and the two of us jumped into each others arms and jumped about deliriously
9031917 after the equalising goal i had moved down along with hundreds of others to this big wall that ran around the pitch
9031918 a lot of the fans fell into the moat and had to be pulled out
9031919 a few of the boys had to make a mad dash to ronnie simpsons goal the ones with false teeth had kept them in ronnie simpsons cap in the goal so they could put them in quickly for the presentation but ronnie forgot to bring them when he ran up the pitch to join us
9031920 i changed jerseys with bedin who had been marking me
9031921 i jumped onto the park and headed for what players i could see
9031922 once the crowd started to get on the park we all scattered back into the tunnel and the changing room
9031923 there was an announcement first in english then in italian and portuguese saying that the presentation of the trophy would be delayed
9031924 i remember big jock coming to me and saying that i and myself and the assistant manager sean fallon had to go and get the trophy
9031925 it was only billy mcneill who was taken through the crowd up to this huge balcony with pillars on either side of him
9031926 we didnt know the cup wasnt there or that billy wasnt there
9031927 we stood in a massive crowd and waited for the trophy to come up
9031928 having seen the footage of the presentation so often i know what happened but i dont have any distinct recollection of it
9031929 certainly it would have been nice if wed had a lap of honour but thousands of these people came from glasgow and some of them left themselves skint for years
9031930 i was on the park a good hour after the game kissing the grass
9031931 later on that evening when we were sitting in the restaurant when billy came in with a box and gave us all our medals
9031932 when the busses left for the airport the locals were lined up on the streets clapping us at one or two in the morning mothers kids grannies
9031933 it was different three years later when we got to the european cup final again
9031934 ive read stories that some fans ended up staying in lisbon and getting jobs
9031935 i think some of the planes flew out with maybe a dozen people missing
9031936 at the airport we heard a roar as the celtic team arrived with their wives
9031937 the day i came home i dressed my car up with flags and took my brother and two sons to the airport to see the team come home
9031938 the best thing that happened was when we came back to celtic park that made up for not getting the cup presented the right way
9031939 when i got home the following day i went round to visit my dad
9031940 maybe i shouldnt have but i had dug up a big bit of the pitch and brought it home in my bag
9031941 after that game for the first time ever i sent a letter to big jock stein and thanked him for everything he had done for celtic
9031942 winning the european cup was the making of the club
9031943 that just proved to europe that we were the best team we entered five tournaments that year and we won all five of them

9031958 we are the busiest weve ever been period all four services all of our instructors have done multiple deployments
9031959 the op tempo is going going going we bring the veterans here because they have the knowledge of whats going on in theater we also try to give them time to decompress
9031960 it is inherently a physical exercise but its also intellectual
9031961 if you are in 80 pounds of kevlar and ceramic plates it will take its toll on you
9031962 its like a workout you are soaked in sweat and your ability to think and act is inhibited its something you have to work through the physical exhaustion and the heat
9031963 when the ball is on your side of the court his body language suggests he does not have much energy
9031964 but when the ball is on his side of the court he bursts into action he tries to make you fall asleep by playing lots of long rallies
9031965 all the heavy lifting would be done by this afternoon
9031966 the hurricane disaster preparations will not interfere with the ongoing negotiations
9031967 shes a fairly articulate spokesperson for the pro drilling view that will provide an interesting contrast to the opposition
9031968 shes taken the ethical high ground and distanced herself from veco
9031969 she also has attempted to reverse the course established by the murkowski administration which was one where the administration directly negotiated with the oil industry in secret
9031970 gov palin certainly showed leadership on the gas line if happens to be elected as president that would put a strong representative in the administration in washington thats in favor of an alaska gas line
9031971 we are disappointed think the jury is wrong and we will be appealing
9031972 caught my eye amp i couldnt wait to check that out i hadnt been on the internet much at all before maybe 2001 ish maybe even later
9031973 first and foremost the wallabies have got to meet whats obviously going to come the other way and its going to be significant
9031974 last week we were able to deny early some of that pressure and that will be important again because there will be some significant challenges coming at us
9031975 if you dont cope with them then all of a sudden youve got a different contest
9031976 i suspect there will be a distinct approach and ellis park lends itself to that anyway
9031977 across the park theyve obviously been very disappointing with the way theyve gone over the last couple of games but its their last hit out in the tri nations its ellis park theyll throw everything at us
9031978 were certainly not reading too much into their last couple of performances we know it will be a different team on saturday afternoon and if were not up for the game then theyll really put the sword into us
9031979 if you are inaccurate and you turn over possession the opposition has the ability to move you from one end of the ground to the other a bit quicker and with greater ease
9031980 so you wont want to be turning over ball or ill discipline for that matter because it adds another 10 metres on the kicking range

9032123 mccain clearly sees the power of women voters in this election but has just as clearly failed to support any of the issues that they care about
9032124 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest class ceiling in america
9032125 but it turns out that the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that once and for all
9032126 any kind of perceived whine about that excess criticism i think man that doesnt do us any good

9032133 building this clinic represents an important expansion in abbotts commitment to improving access to care for children in the developing world during the last decade
9032134 it fulfills a critical need in tanzania where we have been improving health systems not only for people with hiv but also for those with other chronic health issues as well
9032135 while we are making progress in enrolling adults into hiv care and treatment our services for children have severely lagged behind due to lack of trained physicians and other necessary resources
9032136 we expect the new center of excellence to accelerate our ability to make progress against our national treatment goals for children with hiv
9032137 the mbeya center of excellence will provide the foundation for pediatric hiv treatment for the foreseeable future helping not only to save childrens lives but increase health care worker capacity in the country
9032138 we are confident that we will see the profound improvements in children s health in mbeya that we have seen across africa when integrating pediatric hiv clinics into national aids programs

9032141 the homogeneous and undifferentiated character of modern cities kills all variety of life styles and arrest the growth of individual character

9032143 at amp t offers data plans for blackberry that include tethering for an additional 30 per month a total of 60 per month for the blackberry tethering plan it seems ludicrous that the same thing is not offered with the iphone i understand the desire to prevent tethering with the current data plan but i am willing to pay more money to allow tethering with such an advanced device why can i not do so
9032144 we agree and are discussing it with att steve sent from my iphone

9032148 if we have sex you can take everything off but my shoes
9032149 wir sprechen gerade in letzter zeit vor allem w hler von vp und sp an
9032150 themen wie etwa die umwelt derzeit im wahlkampf keine rolle spielen und auch nicht polarisieren

9032152 i do support the infrastructure projects that are on tap here in the state of alaska that our congressional delegations worked hard for
9032153 developing rsm pedals has been a multi year program for us that has resulted in a platform on which we can develop in many directions
9032154 our 24 bit hardware firmware and software system will allow us to model many acoustic spaces instruments and electronic modifications at very little cost to the customer one could easily be misled by the compact pedal form factor but under the hood of our rsm processors you will find a lot of substantial fx for djs keyboardists and guitar amp effects loops alike
9032155 this five game match showed a wide spectrum of mental toughness both teams battled hard in one and two and we felt great going 2 0 however this early in the season every team is attempting to figure themselves out so i knew it was going to be tough to win in three
9032156 games three and four were disappointing with the point deficit
9032157 going into game five we discussed only confidence competitiveness urgency and effort i am proud of how the girls responded and hope to continue to see the positive strides we took from this match throughout the rest of the tournament

9032161 it was a personal visit of the president of the united states with parents who have lost two sons to this war
9032162 they felt it was a very special time to have to have appreciation shown directly to them

9032169 prayer of ancestors for freedom and prosperity in a land they were forced to call home have been answered
9032170 obama inspired me it would be pretty cool if he became president because the same thing could happen to me
9032171 i am proud to be alive and be part of this
9032172 this is a moment in history we couldnt let pass because it has been years in the making
9032173 we agree and are discussing it with att steve sent from my iphone
9032174 fromsms service was inspired by our own needs having customers in many countries and end users all over the world we often encountered issues with sms roaming character encoding and restrictions of socalled short numbers as many web applications can benefit from sms messaging interface we decided to make fromsms available for everybody
9032175 the existing services on the market are suitable for sending of bulk sms messages and for premium priced sms services but many web applications dont have those kinds of needs
9032176 wealth to flow into the hands that could render it most productive
9032177 all communities divide themselves into the few and the many the first are rich and wellborn the other the mass of the people the people are turbulent and changing they seldom judge or determine right
9032178 the system of banking we have both equally and ever reprobated i contemplate it as a blot left in all our constitutions which if not covered will end in their destruction i sincerely believe with you that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies and that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity under the name of funding is but swindling futurity on a large scale
9032179 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies already they have raised up a money aristocracy that has set the government at defiance the issuing power should be taken form the banks and restored to the government to whom it properly belongs
9032180 the notes paid interest which makes them almost impossible to circulate as currency
9032181 the treasury notes which may be issued shall be a legal tender in all debts due
9032182 that the secretary of the treasury be required and directed to adopt measures to cause all duties taxes debts or sums of money accruing or becoming payable to the united states to be collected and paid in the legal currency of the united states or in notes of banks which are payable and paid on demand in the said legal currency of the united states
9032183 nothing herein contained shall be construed to make any thing but gold and silver a tender in payment of any debt due from the united states to individuals
9032184 the men who have loaned you money bankers are the very men who now beg you for this measure of financial aid
9032185 different views never before entertained by american statesman or jurists
9032186 mercenaries 2 world in flames hits stores sunday in north america
9032187 gentlemen i have had men watching you for a long time and i am convinced that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate in the breadstuffs of the country when you won you divided the profits amongst you and when you lost you charged it to the bank you tell me that if i take the deposits from the bank and annul its charter i shall ruin ten thousand families that may be a true gentleman but that is your sin should i let you go on you will ruin fifty thousand families and that would be my sin you are a den of vipers and thieves i have determined to rout you out and by the eternal god i will rout you out
9032188 slavery is likely to be abolished by the war power and all chattel slavery abolished this i and my european friends are in favor of for slavery is but the owning of labor and carries with it the care of the laborers while the european plan led on by england is that capital shall control labor by controlling wages the great debt that the capitalists will see to it is made out of the war must be used as a means to control the volume of money to accomplish this the bonds must be used as a banking basis we are now waiting for the secretary of the treasury to make this recommendation to congress it will not do to allow the greenback as it is called to circulate as money any length of time as we cannot control that but we can control the bonds and through them the bank issues
9032189 it is the renewal and extension of the life of the bonds they are after so that the national banks may flourish under existing laws
9032190 if that mischievous financial policy which had its origin in the north american republic i e honest constitutionally authorized non debt money should become indurated down to a fixture then that government will furnish its own money without cost it will pay off its debts and be without a debt to the international bankers it will become prosperous beyond precedent in the history of the civilized governments of the world the brains and wealth of all countries will go to north america that government must be destroyed or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe
9032191 yes we may all congratulate ourselves that this cruel war is nearing its close it has cost a vast amount of treasure and blood the best blood of the flower of american youth has been freely offered upon our countrys altar that the nation might live it has been indeed a trying hour for the republic but i see in the future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country as a result of the war corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the republic is destroyed i feel at this moment more anxiety for the safety of my country than ever before even in the midst of the war
9032192 if there be anything in the history of the constitution which can be established with moral certainty it is that the framers of that instrument intended to prohibit the issue of legal tender notes both by the general government and by the states
9032193 we all know that the value of the notes of the government in the market and in the commercial world generally depends upon their convertibility on demand into coin and as confidence in such convertibility increases of diminishes so does the exchangeable value of the notes vary so far from becoming themselves standards of value by reason of the legislative declaration to that effect their own value is measured by the facility with which they can be exchanged into that which alone is regarded as money by the commercial world they are promises of money but they are not money in the sense of the constitution
9032194 but beyond and above all the objections which i have stated to the decision recognizing a power in congress to impart the legal tender quality to the notes of the government is my objection to the rule of construction adopted by the court to reach its conclusions a rule which fully carried out would change the whole nature of our constitution and break down the barriers which separate a government of limited from one of unlimited powers the framers of the constitution as i have said were profoundly impressed with the evils which had resulted from the vicious legislation of the states making notes a legal tender and they determined that such a power should not exist any longer they therefore prohibited the states from exercising it and they refused to grant it to the new government which they created of what purpose is it then to refer to the exercise of the power by the absolute or the limited governments of europe or by the states previous to out constitution congress can exercise no power by virtue of any supposed inherent sovereignty in the general government the power to commit violence perpetrate injustice take private property by force without compensation to the owner and compel the receipt of promises to pay in place of money may be exercised as it often has been by irresponsible authority but it cannot be considered as belonging to a government founded upon law but be that as it may there is no such thing as a power of inherent sovereignty in the government of the united states it is a government of delegated powers supreme within its prescribed sphere but powerless outside of it in this country sovereignty resides in the people and congress can exercise no power which they have not by their constitution intrusted to it all else is withheld
9032195 the doctrine that a power not expressly forbidden may be exercised would as i have observed change the character of our government if i have read the constitution aright the true doctrine is the very opposite of this if the power is not in terms granted and is not necessary and proper for the exercise of a power which is thus granted it does not exist
9032196 the first established links between n m rothschild and the united states date back to 1821 when the bankers r amp j phillips in philadelphia became agents for nmr business in the usa phillips were the first in a series of agents who were used to develop nmrs business interests in the country and correspondence from them can be found among the records of the correspondence department from the banks accounts it is clear that by the end of the 1830s substantial and wide ranging investments had been made in municipal and state stock in canal and mining shares and in finance houses the main activities carried on through the agents were in the fields of bullion and bills of exchange in 1833 nmr entrusted the new york banking house of j l amp s josephs amp co with the representation of its business interests in that city the firm worked in conjunction with r amp j phillips in the following year 1834 nmr succeeded in obtaining the business of undertaking the united states governments banking interests in europe hitherto in the hands of barings the rothschilds represented the u s government until 1843 when john tyler became president and barings ally daniel webster was appointed secretary of state webster promptly restored the accounts from rothschilds to barings the disastrous new york banking crisis of 1837 saw the failure along with many other banks of the rothschilds new york agents j l amp s josephs this coincided with the arrival in new york of august belmont a confidential clerk employed by the frankfurt rothschilds though on his way to havana on behalf of the london and paris rothschilds to investigate the affairs of the spanish government on discovering the crisis in new york belmont turned his attention to sorting out rothschild interests there he quickly realized the potential of new yorks growing economy and suggested that the rothschilds appoint him as their agent in new york the firm of august belmont amp co the discovery of gold in california in 1848 awakened nmr interest given the banks substantial involvement in bullion trading a second important rothschild agency in the usa was rapidly established in san francisco in 1849 by benjamin davidson and john may the connection persisted until the impact of the gold rush had diminished letters from the american agents are mainly filed within the correspondence department as far back as 1839 nmr had been involved in the business of raising finance for the u s federal government and its institutions in that year nmr together with the paris house of de rothschild fr res contracted for a it was however in the 1870s that the banks involvement in this area was at its fullest in 1872 nmr raised a 15 million bond issue for the city of new york to finance municipal improvements and in the following year with baring brothers raised a 5 funded loan for the us government for a massive 300 million a loan of equal size was raised in 1876 this time in conjunction with j s morgan amp co and seligman brothers and in 1877 a further 700 million with these same partners together with rose amp co the last major issue raised on behalf of the federal government was for 62 million in 1895 with j s morgan the scope of the records in the american department is wider then the name suggests rothschilds non european business interests in australia mexico china and india were dealt with by the american department
9032197 but there were steps being taken even now to bring him out of the financial backwaters and they were not being taken by pierpont morgan himself
9032198 in 1899 j p morgan and drexel went to england to attend the international bankers convention when they returned j p morgan had been appointed head representative of the rothschild interests in the united states as the result of the london conference j p morgan and company of new york drexel and company of philadelphia grenfell and company of london and morgan harjes cie of paris m m warburg company of germany and america and the house of rothschild were all affiliated
9032199 for the last one hundred and fifty years the history of the house of rothschild has been to an amazing extent the backstage history of western europe because of their success in making loans not to individuals but to nations they reaped huge profits someone once said that the wealth of rothschild consists of the bankruptcy of nations
9032200 the clearest example of a personal linkup international directorates on a western european scale is the rothschild family the london and paris branches of the rothschilds are bound not just by family ties but also by personal link ups in jointly controlled companies
9032201 the chief backbone of this organization grew up along the already existing financial cooperation running from the morgan bank in new york to a group of international financiers in london led by lazard brothers

9032209 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create deposits and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create deposits
9032210 this is a staggering thought we are completely dependent on the commercial banks someone has to borrow every dollar we have in circulation cash or credit if the banks create ample synthetic money we are prosperous if not we starve we are absolutely without a permanent money system when one gets a complete grasp of the picture the tragic absurdity of our hopeless position is almost incredible but there it is it is the most important subject intelligent persons can investigate and reflect upon it is so important that our present civilization may collapse unless it becomes widely understood and the defects remedied very soon
9032211 the bold efforts that the present bank has made to control the government and the distress it has wantonly caused are but premonitions of the fate which awaits the american people should they be deluded into a perpetuation of this institution or the establishment of another like it if the people only understood the rank injustice of our money and banking system there would be a revolution before morning
9032212 but when the charter for the bank of the united states was obtained from congress it perfected the paper system and gave to its advocates the position they have struggled to obtain from the commencement of the federal government down to the present hour the immense capital and peculiar privileges bestowed upon it enabled it to exercise despotic sway over the other banks in every part of the country from its superior strength it could seriously injure if not destroy the business of any one of them that would incur its resentment and it openly claimed for itself the power of regulating the currency throughout the united states in other words it asserted and undoubtedly possessed the power to make money plenty or scarce at its pleasure at any time and in any quarter of the union by controlling the issues of other banks and in permitting an expansion or compelling a general contraction of the circulating medium according to its own will the other banking institutions were sensible of its strength and they soon became generally its obedient instruments ready at all times to execute its mandates and with the other banks necessarily went also that numerous class of persons in our commercial cities who depend altogether on bank credits for their solvency and means of business and who are therefore obliged for their safety to propitiate the favor of the money power by distinguished zeal and devotion in its service the result of the ill advised legislation which established this great monopoly was to concentrate the whole moneyed power of the union with its boundless means of corruption and its numerous dependents under the direction and command of one acknowledged head thus organizing this particular interest as one body and securing to it unity of action throughout the united states and enabling it to bring forward upon any occasion its entire and undivided strength to support or defeat any measure of the government in the hands of this formidable power thus perfectly organized was also placed unlimited dominion over the amount of circulating medium giving it the power to regulate the value of property and the fruits of labor in every quarter of the union and to bestow prosperity or bring ruin upon any city or section of the country as might best comport with its own interests or policy we are not left to conjecture how the moneyed power thus organized and with such a weapon in its hands would be likely to use it the distress and alarm which pervaded and agitated the whole country when the bank of the united states waged war upon the people in order to compel them to submit to their demands cannot yet be forgotten the ruthless and unsparing temper with which whole cities and communities were oppressed individuals impoverished and ruined a scene of cheerful prosperity suddenly changed into one of gloom and despondency ought to be indelibly impressed on the memory of the people of the united states if such were its power in a time of peace what would it not have been in a season of war with an enemy at your doors no nation but the freeman of the united states could have come out victorious from such contest yet if you had not conquered the government would have passed from the hands of the many to the hands of the few and this organized money power from its secret conclave would have dictated the choice of your highest officers and compelled you to make peace or war as best suited their own wishes the form of your government might for a time have remained but its living spirit would have departed from it

9032216 our gold dollar is certainly as good a unit of value as the franc and so the english think of their pound sterling these coins are now exchangeable only at a considerable loss and this exchange is a profit only to brokers and bankers surely each commercial nation should be willing to yield a little to secure a gold coin of equal value weight and diameter from whatever mint it may have been issued as the gold 5 franc piece is now in use by over 60 000 000 of people of several different nationalities and is of convenient form and size it may well be adopted by other nations as the common standard of value leaving to each nation to regulate the divisions of this unit in silver coins or tokens if this is done france will surely abandon the impossible effort of making two standards of value gold coins will answer all the purposes of european commerce a common gold standard will regulate silver coinage of which the united states will furnish the greater part especially for the chinese trade

9032229 all forms of money issued or coined by the united states shall be maintained at a parity of value with this standard

9032231 it was essentially provided in the national bank law that they should take these bonds of the united states not state bonds or corporation bonds but bonds of the united states upon which they are to base their operations that is now essential they had exclusive of the 1894 95 bonds 685 000 000 how many banks are there in the united states more than 3 500 with a paid in capital of more than 605 000 000 so when the bonds due in 1907 are taken up there will be but little left to bank on therefore the banks must have more bonds they seek in this bill to renew the life of the bonds they make it a bond for thirty years longer it is the renewal and extension of the life of the bonds they are after so that the national banks may flourish under existing laws the banks are at the back and bottom of it

9032361 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination passions fly on immigration but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers this too is part of americas promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort

9032365 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
9032366 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
9032367 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
9032368 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
9032369 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
9032370 you get a very old style computer voice asking you to input your debit credit card number
9032371 its surprising that relatively little hurricane premium has been added to the market perhaps its because refiners are at present running only at 87 percent of capacity compared to running at 97 percent when hurricane katrina hit
9032372 could be that at present demand destruction is the engine thats driving the complex lower while at katrinas time of impact in august 2005 the talk was all about runaway demand
9032373 right now there is still uncertainty on where exactly gustav will hit and so it is difficult to determine the damage that the storm might bring
9032374 the dollar is up and so were seeing prices of crude move down from the highs remember that in 2005 the market sold off hard before katrinas arrival and then rallied again when it hit

9032376 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others

9032379 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs
9032380 the steps taken by the alaska state legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs
9032381 we in alaska feel that crunch and are taking steps to address it right here at home
9032382 this is a tool that must be on the table to buy us time until our long term energy plans can be put into place we have already enjoyed the support of alaska senator ted stevens and it is gratifying to see senator obama get on board

9032420 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
9032421 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying even as late as yesterday we had secured a new investment package but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying the collapse of zoom is a result of matter beyond our control
9032422 there are a number of ground support agencies and services as well as the airport authority that are owed some funds from zoom so the aircraft is on the ground in calgary pending resolution with zoom and the leaseholder as well as the creditors

9032433 our programs are a great way for working parents to ensure their children are supervised and in a safe environment after school
9032434 the programs also give children time to do their homework and have some fun with assistance from our staff
9032435 in the old days we could lock our doors and windows to protect our children now sexual predators come electronically into our homes

9032439 art must always be free and the artist should not have any restrictions on freedom of expression
9032440 its becoming more common to see families committing to driving less
9032441 i think its a part of the market that will continue to grow as gas gets more expensive
9032442 living out in the suburbs just isnt a big deal anymore
9032443 people want to live work and go to school within a six blocks radius thats changing the way they look at property
9032444 for people who want to drive less it just makes sense that theyd be looking for different things in a neighbourhood
9032445 kirsten was able to see things about places we were looking at that i dont think a normal agent would have noticed
9032446 youre going to want to look at streets with low traffic volume
9032447 i saw the yard and the garage and i said i have to buy this house
9032448 this is a hard job to do on a bike
9032449 you have to get the right people and the day has to be nice you have to be looking at property in the same couple mile location
9032450 if youre meeting someone on location youre not exactly business presentable when you show up dripping with sweat
9032451 if they dont want a sweaty realtor then maybe they want someone else
9032452 most people dont care the last clients i took out bought an 800 000 house they arent exactly poor people living off the earth
9032453 short of dressing up as a leprechaun or lighting yourself on fire youd have to work super hard to stand out as the best or worst dressed person in the room when theres a woman in a bedazzled fur turban making the rounds your skirt is bes ide the point so just relax and ogle

9032458 an innovative and engaging way for people to share their lives leverage their community and get the most out of their online experience
9032459 it will become a feature inside other services for example its possible that youll log into yahoo mail and see your profile along with all of your friends profiles in your contact list
9032460 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
9032461 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
9032462 civilian casualties are primarily being caused in airstrikes in support of the counterterrorism mission that the united states is running completely separate from the nato run counterinsurgency conflict
9032463 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some seven to eight houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
9032464 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
9032465 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
9032466 the fact is that the taliban now has pretty good insight into where were picking up information and how were developing it into actionable intelligence
9032467 and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us
9032468 they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us
9032469 for all who are called to the cause of freedom
9032470 alas must it ever be so do we stand in our own light wherever we go and fight our own shadows forever
9032471 i want to work as a lee mcintyre intern in his manchester office because
9032472 ant claims that we will find a much more scientific way of building the social world if we abstrain from interrupting the flood of controversies we too should find our firm ground on shifting sands contrary to what is so often said relativism is a way to float on data not drown in them
9032473 we have to resist pretending that actors have only a language while the analyst possesses the
9032474 the atoms as their own weight bears them down plumb through the void at scarce determined times in scarce determined places from their course decline a little call it so to speak mere changed trend for were it not their wont thuswise to swerve down would they fall each one like drops of rain through the unbottomed void and then collisions neer could be nor blows among the primal elements and thus nature would never have created aught
9032475 weve got the best defense im ever going to play against their defense is nothing compared to ours
9032476 its one of the better teams in the nation it has been for quite some time
9032477 its a great opportunity for our program to play a team of that caliber
9032478 i think everyone is going to be a little bit nervous
9032479 its the first game and for a lot of guys its going to be their first start
9032480 we know whoever its going to be theyre going to be ready
9032481 we know theyre a solidly coached defense a very disciplined group i know its going to be a challenge for us
9032482 were a new team were trying to put our stamp on the usc tradition well find out a lot about ourselves on saturday
9032483 i really feel like were ready for any blitz situation they throw at us
9032484 if we can handle this situation we can handle anything the only way you become the best is to play the best i believe i hope were going to do special things
9032485 the child is in custody and in the care of afghan authorities
9032486 the united states never assumed custody of the boy as part of our effort to confirm the identity and citizenship of the child the consular official from our embassy in kabul are initiating a consular visit to check on the child and his welfare
9032487 before we go into a theoretical what happens we should probably wait and see what the status is
9032488 first we need to confirm and find out and then we will take the next step
9032489 consistent with that of a potential offspring of aafia siddiqui
9032490 under afghan and international law ahmed siddiqui is too young to be treated as a criminal suspect
9032491 he should never have been transferred to the custody of afghanistans abusive intelligence agency
9032492 oh hey manny yeah i got a homerun today how about you so what do you say we pull some antics to see if we can get on better teams
9032493 how can we get more 18 year olds to prepare for careers as professors at research universities what can the top research universities teach us about academic hiring
9032494 how can we make life easier for assistant professors with families at top research universities how can we produce a better pool for the top research universities to recruit from
9032495 when were done here well arrange a sandbag and a cage

9032504 breaking off diplomatic relations with tbilisi is not moscows choice and the responsibility lies with tbilisi
9032505 if european countries want to serve the foreign policy interests of the united states in my view they wont win anything from this
9032506 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
9032507 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
9032508 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
9032509 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia
9032510 oh wow speechless actually i think its just a gimmick right now
9032511 its not going to sway me im a republican so im gonna vote for mccain anyway
9032512 someone in my friends office just told me that she was a housewife before that and the mayor of a little town so thats good
9032513 it really pushed me to the edge to vote for mccain just the fact telling a story about her family just made me feel like it was my family
9032514 i think its great that its a woman however i dont know why he chose her because she has such limited experience
9032515 i dont get upset because i have answered this question many times theres no need to explain anymore
9032516 we are negotiating with both and theyre going at the same speed
9032517 now were talking about racial slurs and kind of like a death threat
9032518 the one had some rocks thrown through the window the other one had some graffiti on the shed that they had to repaint
9032519 i got to get rid of this because it affects my children so much
9032520 and it affects the community that people out there still think things like this and its still happening and its occurring and its sad
9032521 they need to stop its getting out of control before someone gets seriously hurt or injured its not funny
9032522 everybody does it does that make it right no but reporting it is wasted energy
9032523 shes one of many taxpayers who get irked when they see these cars being used for other than official use
9032524 if they are abusing a taxpayer owned vehicle then they should get in trouble it is your right and duty to look into it
9032525 we take very seriously our responsibility to insure that any publicly funded vehicle that we have is being used properly
9032526 it is only to carry state employees or someone whose presence in the vehicle is intrinsic to state business
9032527 and obviously it is very helpful if those people have a license plate number and description of the vehicle because it very well could be its not a penndot vehicle
9032528 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9032529 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
9032530 if this turns out to be a nonevent the market could really come roaring back down
9032531 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
9032532 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday
9032533 u s oil demand is currently 1 6 million barrels a day lower than when katrina struck
9032534 there is today more u s refining capacity offline for economic reasons than can be destroyed by gustav
9032535 we need to remember that the vice president is a heartbeat away from the presidency its especially poignant today on sen mccains 72nd birthday
9032536 i think it is an insult to women that the mccain campaign would think that simply because he picked a woman as his running mate that women would suddenly vote for him
9032537 whats the insult is that diana degette still serves in office
9032538 diana degette and her ilk dont have anything in common with a successful governor of alaska who has fought hard to control government spending and to develop oil resources
9032539 i have never heard of her it is in my view still about what this election is all about that we cant have four more years of george bush
9032540 his selection of someone weve never heard of from alaska i dont think will change a thing for this election

9032560 were all good friends off the track but its a battle royale out there on the track
9032561 it would definitely be cool for me to make the riders cup because i know red bull motogp rookies cup champion j d beach and it would be fun to race him and it would be great to meet some of the other kids too i think it will take more than just a top ten to get in the riders cup which for me is possible at this track its my home circuit but a lot of the other guys have been there too so that should make it interesting
9032562 im feeling really good i got the stitches out of my hand and i am super stoked to get back out there
9032563 ill have a lot of family and friends at the race and i want to get a top five for sure road atlanta is a really good track i like the way it flows and it has some nice off camber turns that are challenging there should be a lot of passing going on i have checked out the new section and it looks like a turn i would like a lot of hard braking down the hill
9032564 we have quite a few rookies that can earn one of the riders cup slots with a good result at road atlanta
9032565 i think well have more riders concerned about the points more than ever we have a tight spread for those last couple of spots it will be a challenging race some of the rookies have some experience here but they have never ridden the track on these bikes and the circuit is also a bit different
9032566 initially she refused bail and after you are arrested if you dont post bail you have to have the hearing within 48 hours

9032569 the cultural impact of elvis presley and rock n roll on the french was huge
9032570 lets not kick the can down the alley and let someone else be responsible for it
9032571 this is why i say its fiscally irresponsible to take money from local government or to borrow money from transportation in order to close that hole that we have that 15 billion deficit
9032572 we dont want to see any borrowing done to balance this budget
9032573 those games have been played for far far too long in sacramento its time for the legislature to collective deal with the problem they have at hand and not borrow from the future not borrow from our children and not borrow from our grandchildren
9032574 we urge the legislature to make responsible budget decisions now and balance the budget now without borrowing from local government and transportation funds

9032603 that defined early waterboys albums are the perfect note on which to start a glorious sun filled weekend
9032604 the idea of making music from an imaginary culture was to give ourselves a set of restrictions and parameters within which to work otherwise we might have just gone on all kinds of creative detours some of which might have been interesting but better we confine ourselves to something which kind of worked at least it kept us within bounds for a while and by the time we abandoned that whole idea which was pretty early on we already had a direction
9032605 i think the recovery not only in the ninth ward but in the city is not where it should be three years after the storm
9032606 i think the challenge that has gotten people so frustrated is they hear of all these great things they hear of the federal government saying weve approved over 100 billion
9032607 but theyre saying when are we gonna see it on our block
9032608 and the reason i start there is because people have to be safe before theyll come back
9032609 we still dont see a commitment to category 5 protection truly comprehensive hurricane and flood protection
9032610 the second thing thats missing from this is a deep commitment not only to flood and hurricane protection but coastal restoration building levees alone is like building a great wall to stop the ocean it doesnt work

9032616 the georgia crisis has provided a rude awakening the sight of russian tanks in a neighbouring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
9032617 the post cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around europe
9032618 the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
9032619 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational
9032620 moscow has acted brutally in georgia but when the united states and britain backed the independence of kosovo without un approval they paved the way for russias defence of south ossetia and for the current western humiliation what is sauce for the kosovo goose is sauce for the south ossetian gander

9032623 i stopped playing adult hockey because it was so hard to get ice time
9032624 john would buy ice time at sharks ice at san jose sharks ice at fremont the ice center of cupertino wherever
9032625 here they play hockey for hours then jump in the pool eat play video games and then go back to the rink and do it all over again
9032626 its really great for skills building passing and shooting that sort of thing
9032627 tyler and his friends love the rink it really was a simple decision

9032646 overheidsbedrijven zoals belgacom zouden beter geprivatiseerd worden de rol van de overheid is in de eerste plaats de voorwaarden cre ren voor een competitieve goedwerkende markt het is niet aan de overheid om zelf een marktspeler te zijn met in dit geval een quasi monopoliepositie er bovenop

9032659 first let me preface my first book review by noting that i am extremely skeptical of marketing experts who sell trading systems and technical analysis products however i believe the internet will allow a handful of successful investors and traders to build a loyal following if and only if said followers can make money brian is going to be one of those success stories

9032662 i was peacefully sidewalk chalking when i was forcefully pushed to ground by a police officer from behind as i was being cuffed on the ground the police officer pushed his knee into the back of my neck i was pulled roughly off the ground and taken away i was given no warning to stop and was completely shocked when i was arrested my back was throbbing from his knee
9032663 as i was sidewalk chalking i was rushed by a police officer without warning and lifted up off the ground and was cuffed i was then dragged by the police into the westin hotel
9032664 let every man look out for himself let every generation look out for itself
9032665 last season at burnley was the poorest away performance of the season or coventry could have been worse this is a new team and i am hoping the effects of burnley last year wont be with them we wait and see what reaction we get tomorrow
9032666 away from home is difficult enough especially when you have the kind of away record we have got and it is up to us now to turn heads
9032667 they have just signed russell anderson he was on loan at plymouth last season
9032668 graham alexander at right back is an international player steven caldwell and anderson have played internationally
9032669 they have got kevin mcdonald who is a very exciting talent from scotland although i dont know if he is getting a game or not they have eagles who they paid 1m plus for and paterson was also 1m plus although they did get 4m from the kyle lafferty sale to rangers
9032670 i am looking forward to the game it is going to be a challenge because we are coming off a big defeat not a big defeat as far as the result but a big defeat performance wise i want a positive reaction i want to be upbeat i was a bit morose after the game on saturday which was a frustration of mine because i should not let things like that get me down
9032671 we are looking forward to saturday after a positive result on tuesday night
9032672 it would be great to go into the international break with a first league win under our belt and a home game against plymouth gives us that opportunity but we know it is going to be a tough game
9032673 i think with the players we have we couldnt have foreseen the start we had it did give us a rethink but over the course of the last fortnight owen steve davis and myself have worked on that and there has been a lot of time spent on the training ground
9032674 much of it has been repetitive stuff but it was stuff that needed to be fixed and hopefully we are reaping the dividends the players are probably bored to death with it now but we needed an improvement and i think we have seen that
9032675 we have changed the system a little in the middle of the part to have graham alexander sit in there and that encourages both chris mccann and kevin mcdonald to get forward a little bit more
9032676 they can do that with their fitness levels because they are young men with great energy levels chris in particular showed that on tuesday night when he was a goal threat every time he got close to goal
9032677 as with anything results give you confidence and then you start making those runs you perhaps didnt previously make but theres certainly more to come
9032678 we are delighted to welcome steve to the trico management team
9032679 his years of financial and capital structure experience will greatly benefit trico as we continue to implement our strategic plan we are confident that he will make a significant positive impact and should help us deliver increased shareholder value

9032711 youd be surprised how often consumers tell us to get rid of it
9032712 the bad guys are using whatever they can to enhance the email
9032713 the information they use is pretty easy to find online
9032714 from a technology perspective there is nothing new with this spam
9032715 the real difference is that most social engineering is positive while this spam is threatening
9032716 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9032717 all human communities live out of some story that provides a context for understanding the meaning of history and gives shape and direction to their lives
9032718 if we allow the bible to become fragmented rather than a coherent story it is in danger of being absorbed into whatever other story is shaping our culture and it will thus cease to shape our lives as it should
9032719 the biblical story is a compelling unity on which we may depend and each of us has a place within that story
9032720 we need some sense of the big story of the world before the meaning of any event in our lives makes sense
9032721 individual experiences make sense and acquire meaning only when seen within the context or frame of some story we believe to be the true story of the world
9032722 because of the individualism and consumerism central to the western cultural story divorce is often portrayed as something rather positive
9032723 the basic story assumed in much of modern western culture is humanistic and has its roots in the european enlightenment of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the belief that human reason is the measure of all things and that knowledge is power permeated european society people believed that through science and technology alone and utterly apart from god humankind could build a perfect world it is a false story in stark contradiction to the truth of the biblical story the modern western worldview is not the only such grand story available there is another better and truer way in which to see our world
9032724 to be human means to embrace some such basic story through which we understand our world and chart our course through it this does not mean that individuals are necessarily conscious of the story they are living out of or of the molding effect that such a story has had on their thought and actions for instance many college and university students of our time are living sexually promiscuous lives they may live this way without thinking much about why they do so hence they are not at all likely to see that the story within which such conduct is approved is heavily indebted to jean jacques rousseau sigmund freud and other such thinkers of past centuries their views of marriage and the human person underlie the changes in attitude toward sexuality that took place in the 1960s and onward
9032725 kids have been getting jiggy with it for thousands of years
9032726 its perfectly natural we should be glad to live in a more enlightened era where these arbitrary religious suppressions can be exposed for the farses that they are
9032727 it is often difficult to be sure that our isolated experience has given us the complete picture of anything complicated
9032728 when we conduct polls the responses we get are we dont know how to manage someone we cant see
9032729 honestly from a business perspective gas prices are not as much a factor
9032730 that doesnt mean that senior management isnt concerned and doesnt see that as a definite problem but they still run their businesses and what they are going to react to is when it starts to affect their turnover and ability to attract employees they wont necessarily implement something unless they see it as a win for both

9032773 as for that vp talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that that vp slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up here for the rest of the u s before i can even start addressing that question

9032808 i feel that the most accurate representation of my candidacy and of the voters judgment would occur with a dual party listing on the ballot
9032809 but the states elections division requires that i choose either the republican or independent nomination based on their current interpretation of oregon election law
9032810 joel doesnt want to turn his back on the large majority of republican voters that supported him but we feel that maybe the independent party is more in line with traditional republican values than the republican party is

9032819 the key had the offsetting merit of permitting the white king to be checked
9032820 the procedure for solving three move problems is similar in many ways to that for two movers however three movers are commonly threat problems a waiting move three mover being rather a rarity accordingly the solver usually takes it for granted that a three mover has a threat unless the setting definitely suggests a block position since only an occasional three mover is a block few of them can be solved by any mechanical routine without resorting to an unnecessarily detailed analysis
9032821 the difficulty of a two move problem can be reduced to a mere mechanical analysis depending upon the rapidity with which the solver can take up each move in succession and see if the defense has a possible reply to the few checking moves that might terminate the solution as soon as a move is hit upon which might possibly be one of the first looked at which admits of no defense the problem is solved yet i have seen solvers baffled by a little problem where the attack had but twenty possible key moves
9032822 it shows i need to perfect my play of two move variations
9032823 i cannot dwell too strongly upon the importance of learning to solve a two move problem correctly i have devoted years of practice to this one object and am still far from perfect no matter how many moves a solution contains it can always be reduced to a series of steps or sequences of two moves at a time the key move and the second or objective move the latter being a sequel to the first simple as it may appear to those who can readily boast of announcing a mate in half a dozen moves or more the entire ability of a solver depends upon his powers of taking an accurate and exhaustive glance only two moves deep and i have yet to find the solver who can infallibly do so
9032824 it is remarkable to see how few moves there really are to a problem therefore in this position which is a very free one if the solver can look at each of the thirty nine possible moves in rotation and from that second standpoint say at a glance in thirty eight cases no two move mate he can thoroughly exhaust analyze and solve the most difficult three mover extant in less time than it takes to tell it
9032825 this is the original of what is known as the
9032826 i used to think it a very good scale to say that a three mover should be six times as difficult as a two mover a four mover four times as difficult as a three mover and a five mover five times as difficult as a four mover which would make it equal to 120 two movers this is not a very high estimate when we consider how few good five movers have ever been composed that are up to standard
9032827 there are two principal ways to set about discovering the solution of a problem the one is by the experimental trial of moves the other by the analytical examination of the resources of the position in the latter method we first study the placing of the two kings is the white king in a place of safety so that we are free to operate against the enemy or is he so open to attack that we must commence an immediate onslaught on the adverse king or else prepare a defense for our own does the white king take an active part in the fray is the black king already hedged in or has he got to be captured as well as mated in this problem the white king is exposed to a check that could not be allowed as it would give the defense an opportunity of prolonging the mate beyond the required number of moves white is therefore compelled to force the fight throughout or to prevent the counter attack
9032828 when taking up a three move problem the experienced solver judges from the general appearance of the position whether it has been composed to illustrate some form of strategy in the moves leading to the mates or for the beauty of the mating position themselves sometimes both of these objectives are combined in one problem but such instances are exceptional where the aim of the composer is centered on showing some interesting type of strategy in whites attack in blacks defense or in both combined the problem is termed a strategic one in the other general class of three move problem the beauty of mating positions is the reason in compositions of this kind there will usually be two three or more model mate positions and so are called model mate problems a model mate is a mate in which the square on which the black king stands and each adjoining square is guarded or blocked only once and every white piece on the board takes part in the mate with the possible exception of the white king
9032829 when most of the squares in the black ks field or a little outside it assuming that he may move out are controlled in only one way model mates are reasonably likely a solver should then search for play which will purify the remaining squares remembering that sacrifice is frequently used to economize the white force
9032830 the position has a model mate look six of the squares adjoining the black k are only once controlled no other theme seems likely from the lay out of the pieces which show little possibility of black strategy a well known type of model is seen to arise if the white r abandoning his control doubled by a white p on c2 can mate on the fourth rank provided that the qs control of d5 can be abolished the try 1 re3 is soon given up for 2 re4 while it shuts off the qs control of d5 is by no means a pure mate the b and n holding squares controlled by the r we come to the q how can we abolish her it is soon seen that qh4 achieves our aim and this may be taken to be the second move threat the key must be 1 rf3 with a model mate after the q sacrifice by rf4 the white p on a4 confirms a r key for its purpose must be the guard of b5 when the k moves out
9032831 the usual four move problem is often easier to solve than a complex three mover because of the great constructional difficulties involved only a few outstanding composers have the technical skill and patience to construct elaborate four movers with several complex variations so ordinarily the four move problem is either a dainty miniature or a strategic composition designed to illustrate some strikingly thematic line of play
9032832 it might be thought that the difficulty of a problem increases in proportion to its length but fortunately this isnt so few long problems are as difficult as a tricky three mover and the great majority are much simpler the reason is that the composer must ensure the problem is sound so in many long problems black has an enormous material advantage this compels white to keep making one move threats to prevent blacks extra material coming into play consequently the solver can often narrow the search down to a few moves with no more than a glance at the position

9033047 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

9033051 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

9033091 our concerns about the weak economy and job losses continue to fall on deaf ears
9033092 for the past several months democrats have told oregonians that our states economy is on the right track and holding steady we dont buy their spin and oregonians dont either
9033093 weve warned that 2 9 billion in new government spending and 1 billion in new government debt was irresponsible and unsustainable while the legislature established a rainy day fund a great bipartisan achievement the democrats insisted on raising business taxes to fund it despite having record new revenue the democrats spent every dime and did nothing to save for oregons future
9033094 our pro growth pro family tax reforms will put more money back into oregonians pocketbooks and put more money back into our struggling economy
9033095 in addition to providing relief to families our measures will create almost 20 000 new jobs according to a nonpartisan analysis
9033096 oregons high capital gains tax rate is a disincentive to keep capital within our state
9033097 reducing that tax rate will encourage new investments in oregon businesses and workers as weve seen at the federal level this reform would also increase state revenue to pay for better schools safer communities and expanded access to health care

9033124 i think that in the balance here sen mccain is going for a younger vote that is the 35 to 50 vote and that is i think a very different dynamic

9033139 the taliban and the insurgents in general are getting closer to kabul there are some outlying districts of kabul where the government is reluctant to go
9033140 and certainly wardak province which is right to the west of kabul is largely under the control of the insurgents logar which is another province very close to kabul is also very heavily populated by the taliban and by insurgents so we are seeing very heavy activity in places that were previously considered fairly stable or safe right around kabul
9033141 we have to take a closer look at what we mean by taliban western media have put the label taliban on anyone with a grievance against the central government or the foreign forces and that group of people is growing day by day
9033142 there have been attacks on government forces and on coalition forces that we assume or are saying come from the taliban that does not necessarily mean that it is it could be militants linked to other political groups such as renegade commander gulbuddin hekmatyars hezb i islami it could be ad hoc or an independent insurgency if you will
9033143 they are actively carrying out a policy which will eventually lead them to lose their monopoly over the insurgency in fact it is already happening
9033144 the taliban are the predominant group in the insurgency but decreasingly so and there might be political consequences for them in the long run many insurgent groups would prioritize the consolidation of the insurgency under their leadership rather than have a diversified insurgency the fact that they go the other way i think is very significant why they do so is not totally clear except that of course the advantage is that it facilitates their geographical expansion
9033145 i believe that they probably tried very hard over the last few years to expand their own organization eastward and northward and they found that there are big difficulties because they didnt have much of a base in these areas they never had
9033146 and after trying and trying they decided that probably they didnt have the potential to do much military action and therefore resorted to alliances with other groups in order to transform their jihad movement into a national movement
9033147 in a recent report we did we were looking at taliban propaganda and one of the interesting findings there was that in fact there wasnt the kind of coordination between the different groups the antigovernment forces whether it was haqanni or the taliban or those that are more closely associated with al qaeda
9033148 there wasnt a strong degree of cooperation that we could identify at least from their writings in fact often they were blaming each other or criticizing people who were claiming to speak for the taliban saying they do not represent the taliban but what you are seeing is that they are all more successfully pursuing their objectives
9033149 there has been a growing body of people who are opposed to the central government and are opposed to the presence of foreign forces here
9033150 some are ready to make alliances among themselves at least in the short term that does not mean that they are all taliban and i think that should they prevail and the foreign forces were to leave there would be a lot of political fallout i do not think that these diverse groups share a common vision of what afghanistan could or should be minus the central government or the international presence
9033151 that component of the pakistani state that supports the insurgency does not necessarily want an outright victory by the taliban nor does not necessarily believe that such a victory is possible or even positive
9033152 there are people i think who would like that in pakistans intelligence and military
9033153 in any long term as the insurgency continues to expand and the bigger it becomes the more difficult it will be for the pakistanis to control and restrain it so i think an insurgency divided into several groups makes it easier to control from the pakistani side
9033154 when he speaks hes really able to say how shall i put it inspirational things america needs this kind of voice
9033155 hes friendly and he cares about citizens he cares about people
9033156 im afraid he will not be as hard with iran as we wish he would be
9033157 the other issue i hope he will be hard with israel and force it to withdraw from the west bank and to form a palestinian state but i am sure he will not do so but im sure john mccain will not do so either
9033158 mr obama is like mr bush like all of them
9033159 no one does anything for the palestinians only for the jewish for the palestinians no one in america will do anything
9033160 one thing is that obama is connected to africa then he is close to africa and he knows a lot about africa
9033161 i think hes a great role model for afro americans and for the africans at large

9033167 the opposite is true the timely and decisive actions of the russian leadership prevented a destabilization of the entire caucasus region
9033168 violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia and is contrary to un security council resolutions supported by russia
9033169 ignores the arguments behind russias position in favor of the difficult but only right decision given the circumstances to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia
9033170 we are just entering the historically active part of hurricane season

9033172 the public got to see the national guard at work guard members and vehicles moving from armories to affected communities providing assistance to people in distress
9033173 we are able meet our mission requirements by preparing sufficient numbers of guardsmen to meet any anticipated weather event
9033174 we have a great deal of recent experience and know that when one weather event has passed we could have another on the horizon it is critical to our long term success to have enough capable people available who are also rested and motivated
9033175 the reason we do that is to be able to cooperate with state agencies and local authorities
9033176 the guard has continuous contact and coordination with the florida division of emergency management in tallahassee and our joint emergency operations center and planning cells ensure the capability to rapidly build up personnel and equipment if needed
9033177 russia will also complete the construction of some partially built facilities
9033178 we do a lot of humanitarian relief missions but this is definitely worthwhile what the c 5 is doing in delivering these items
9033179 we are trying to help as many people as we can by giving them what they need
9033180 good of the air force capability is being used to help the people of georgia
9033181 abkhazia and south ossetia have much stronger grounds for independence than kosovo
9033182 it is impossible to form an objective picture of what happened
9033183 georgia planned the action against south ossetia in advance the only thing they did not expect was that russia would react so forcefully
9033184 had westerners become certain that the resolutions would bring us down to our kneels they would have definitely intensified them the sanctions
9033185 they do know that ultra resolution actions will cost them more dearly
9033186 there are many requests for meeting with him mr ahmadinejads policies of winning audience have worked well
9033187 we have received no note to that effect however as mr ahmadinejad says if we receive any note we will study it and make decisions in line with interests of the two countries
9033188 reinforcing bilateral relations and rebuilding mutual trust with the united states
9033189 a lot of naval aviators cut their teeth on this aircraft and for 50 years its given good service the t 2 buckeye will not be used in naval aviation training anymore
9033190 i had my last flight four or five days ago in the mighty buckeye
9033191 its a great airplane but we understand that you cant keep stuff forever and the new t 45c goshawk is fantastic its going to bring our training a good 20 years into the future overnight
9033192 i started off as a student in the t 2a
9033193 i came back flying it again as an instructor and ended up with 600 to 700 hours in the aircraft its built well and the people who put it together have a lot to be proud of
9033194 sukhumi could easily host black sea fleet ships for instance a naval brigade of up to 30 vessels
9033195 if we cleared up the harbor at the cargo terminal we would be able to station the ships from the naval brigade there
9033196 the nuba mountains region is a microcosm of the tensions surrounding cpa implementation many local residents feel ignored with good reason by the international community and neglected by the un system
9033197 growing ethnic insecurity in the region has the potential to deteriorate significantly over the coming months and needs urgent attention to prevent it from spiralling out of control
9033198 with the sole exception of abyei kordofan suffers an attention deficit
9033199 the dangers of renewed violent conflict and humanitarian crisis in kordofan have been evident ever since the signing of the cpa
9033200 rather than socio economic integration and political reconciliation lubricated by a development efforts and a peace dividend south kordofan is the locus of an armed standoff with many fearing a return to war
9033201 the potential for armed group activity is fuelled by the large numbers of ex combatants the near absence of a comprehensive reintegration programme since organised hostilities ended in 2005
9033202 without the required co location in training centres the former enemies have separate chains of command training armaments and barracks administration of government and splm controlled areas remains separate two local government systems currently operate in parallel with separate policies for education two languages two systems judicial and security systems and local government structures passing from one area to the other involves passing through armed checkpoints
9033203 if you look at the new developments in the area there is a very big gap between what the report is saying and what is also taking place
9033204 i dont think the reports findings have become invalid but there has been a very big breakthrough in terms of integration of separate administrations and police forces
9033205 i would be the last person to say there are no problems in south kordofan that would be nonsense
9033206 but i think this is a huge step forward and i am amazed that there is hardly any attention for this fact i dont think war will be as inevitable as people have been saying
9033207 unmis has done little to calm tensions in contrast to the active efforts of the much smaller number of unarmed ceasefire monitors the joint military commission jmc which were present from 2002 05 military observers in the un mission in sudan unmis peacekeeping force are insufficiently resourced and supported there are no permanent un civil affairs and human rights officers and international ngos and other independent observers are few
9033208 i dont think that unmis has been weak or has failed in implementing its part of ddr
9033209 there are a lot of preparatory things we had to have in place before we could start
9033210 it would have been a disaster all these prerequisites have now been met and that is why we are moving towards a pilot project
9033211 a combination of weak political will an international community distracted by darfur and unmiss underperformance has led to the failure of cpa implementation in south kordofan many now view war in the nuba mountains as inevitable
9033212 all of us have seen in the news the frequent reports of young people killing strangers in the street killing fathers defending their property killing people with learning difficulties killing other young people who are different to them
9033213 for 41 years weve lived in a state sponsored culture of death that has killed five million children and were now surprised that some of the surviving children have turned out violent with no regard for the sanctity of life
9033214 how many children know that their mothers have had an abortion what effect will it have on them knowing that they have been deprived of a brother or sister through abortion
9033215 if a society holds human life so cheaply is it any surprise that young people will also hold life cheaply and engage in violence
9033216 crimes against life is it any wonder that criminality in general thrives and seeks to take advantage of the coarsening and darkening of conscience
9033217 i earnestly call on all catholics in my diocese to support politicians who are opposed to abortion euthanasia research on embryonic human beings
9033218 russias decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia in contravention of its own commitments and obligations could portend further disregard of this institution the security council and its undertakings by one of its permanent members
9033219 this should be a source of concern and reprobation not only for the members of the council but for every member of the united nations whose charter requires that all member states should refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state
9033220 i would like to say that i really liked the statement of the u s permanent representative who was reminding to the members of the security council that states must refrain from the use of force or from the threat of use of force
9033221 i would like to ask the honorable representative of the united states have you found weapons of mass destruction in iraq or are you still looking for them
9033222 the resolutions of the security council cannot be challenged or indeed written off by military action in defiance of the un charter
9033223 in particular the territorial integrity of a un member state reaffirmed repeatedly by an unanimous council cannot be undermined by a sudden armed intervention by a neighboring state
9033224 by its actions moscow has effectively ruled out agreements on a comprehensive council response to the situation in georgia
9033225 russias military action and its recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia represent a unilateral attempt to redraw the borders of a neighboring country through the use of force it is our view that it is entirely unacceptable and unjustified
9033226 more opportune moment and under a formula to be decided
9033227 georgian security services had been actively carrying out intelligence activities on the territory of the russian federation and were preparing terrorist acts on russian territory
9033228 all claims of the russian federation that georgias international legal status was defined in disregard of the will of the abkhaz and ossetian people are absolutely groundless
9033229 the 1991 referendum was held throughout the entire territory of georgia including abkhazia and south ossetia
9033230 its not an accident that theyve had quite a bit of success
9033231 i have seen a little but but not too much yet
9033232 they run pretty basic stuff they blitz a lot bringing linebackers stuff like that
9033233 small schools come out like theyve got something to prove they always have
9033234 they have nothing to lose if they come play a big school all the big schools kind of have a bulls eye on their back they just come up and give it all they got
9033235 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9033236 i think god is reminding us that on the eve of katrina god can bring nature back

9033247 todays talks must now try to see what else can be done to get a consensus among all three parties on the way forward so if it takes them longer i hope they will stay longer and resolve these outstanding issues
9033248 but unless theres a political solution you dont have the necessary framework in order to implement an economic recovery program so the talks are crucial all talks are crucial now in order to find a way forward
9033249 firefighters continue to be called upon to respond to many types of incidents disasters and situations in all kinds of weather day and night
9033250 our coun trys fire service is an amazing cadre of specially trained individuals whom the public relies on during emergencies including extreme weather and natural disasters this requires all firefighters to be prepared to respond in the most challenging conditions

9033263 weve got a bunch of animals and we cant just up and leave them
9033264 this house is pretty strong and i think its stronger now than it ever was before

9033267 the arbitrator shall not have the power to commit errors of law or legal reasoning and the award may be vacated or corrected on appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error
9033268 this is indeed a real hero this is not like any hero weve ever seen before
9033269 what form is better to take which one offers the most benefits
9033270 we have a chance to do something special for this program
9033271 you can only sell hope for so long you have to back up all that talk of being an up and coming program if you want a chance to get the truly elite kids
9033272 right now in the big ten theres a wide open spot for that proverbial no 2 team behind ohio state
9033273 ohio state doesnt recruit anymore they select the kids they want like a usc or a florida but its wide open for no 2 illinois michigan michigan state wisconsin all of them can make a claim
9033274 with the fans and support they have and with that coaching staff staying together they have as good a chance as anybody
9033275 you need to have success on the field in a year like this so you can keep having success in recruiting its all tied to recruiting talent trumps everything else when you put it with coaching and discipline thats when you get a program but you have to get the talent
9033276 my class i believe was ranked 14th in the nation and weve got like six people left
9033277 its basically all about the character of the people you recruit and ive noticed that the character of person that has been recruited lately has been a nice person well grounded i guess you could say
9033278 i would hope things are changing but theyre going to recruit good football players whether in michigan or elsewhere
9033279 no question michigan state has an opportunity and theyre taking advantage of it
9033280 theyve had to reaffirm themselves in the state sort of extend the olive branch to the high school coaches especially in detroit theyve had to work their butts off
9033281 and obviously the change in ann arbor is a factor when you bring in an almost entirely new staff and they dont have a lot of ties to the area theres going to be an opportunity for michigan state
9033282 but michigan is always going to recruit and you know that staff isnt going to turn its back on its own back yard this battle between michigan state and michigan is going to be one of the more fun and interesting stories to follow in national recruiting over the next few years

9033289 im worried that my younger brother has become a tattoo addict
9033290 a full investigation is now under way and i would ask anybody who witnessed the collision to contact police
9033291 i would also like to speak to anyone who saw a white nissan van with sign writing on the side travelling through gisburn towards clitheroe as well as anyone who saw a burgundy land rover discovery travelling from clitheroe towards gisburn before the collision happened

9033296 its a spark that is going to set off more development
9033297 it will add value to the village and hopefully increase the tax base for the community
9033298 i think it is fantastic they are taking an interest in the village
9033299 we did not find sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal prosecution
9033300 i certainly worked to promote the election of republicans but i never intended to violate any rules of the ethics commission and i acted in good faith in regard to the events at issue
9033301 it is good for them to help players learn english when i learned english i became a better player but to suspend them i dont think so
9033302 we have been puzzled if not surprised by some of the reactions
9033303 you have to interact effectively with your pro am partners you need to be able to do media interviews and you need to give a winners acceptance speech in english
9033304 they must speak at a level that effectively accomplishes those three things
9033305 what were seeing is that a handful of players dont speak to the level they need to be
9033306 were not just looking at the lpga as it is now
9033307 were looking at the future of the lpga as you well know we have a large international membership all indications are its not going to get smaller
9033308 if were getting any criticism its coming from outside the organization its not coming from the players and those are the people to whom it applies
9033309 surely if you can say hello thats english is that good enough
9033310 who draws the line about how many words youve got to know in english
9033311 its a big step to actually put it out there
9033312 i remember what roberto de vicenzo once said to me

9033314 if john mccain is looking for a way to shore up his support among evangelical voters he might start talking about adoption in 1993 the mccains adopted a daughter from mother teresas orphanage in bangladesh and the senator has co sponsored legislation to aid adoption including measures that would provide tax credits for expenses and would remove barriers to interracial and interethnic adoption but his efforts are rarely mentioned on the campaign trail at a time when adoption is a hot topic in the evangelical community

9033318 the state should ensure the security of life and property of everybody and must not allow the continuance of violent activities on any pretext there no body should be allowed to take law in his hands and the state government should take immediate and stringent action against the rioters
9033319 its a matter of concern that churches are being attacked yet the state government is just a mute spectator to all this
9033320 i will appeal to states which have not joined the scheme to join it
9033321 it is a logical compassionate step and a social security system that ensures a pension scheme for every working person
9033322 we strongly condemn whatever is happening in orissa and such incidents must be stopped immediately
9033323 we condemn the murder of catholic priest father p thomas the ap federation of churches has demanded a cbi probe into the incident we will take up the matter with the centre and also write to the state government
9033324 they want to form a parallel government they want to challenge the writ of the government and we have decided that we will not allow the militants to do that
9033325 every single statement that could possibly be seen as negative and theres quite a lot has been expunged from the beijing evening news article and almost every nuanced phrase that carries any negative connotation has been turned into one of unqualified praise
9033326 seeing the edits in the raw copy throws it into stark relief
9033327 i feel it would be in the interests of pakistan democracy and the pakistan peoples party that this office of president remains above controversy and i would humbly request mr zardari that he should withdraw his candidature in the supreme national interest and in interest of democratic stability
9033328 i do not want to comment on a persons mental health
9033329 but since he zardari is a public figure contesting a public office the office of supreme commander of the armed forces who has his hand on the nuclear trigger who is also chairman of the nuclear command authority it is legitimate for the people of pakistan to ask whether that story is true or not and what is his response
9033330 his masterful handling of pakistani politics since the assassination of his wife and party chairperson benazir bhutto
9033331 distorting the private health records of our nations leader is a remnant of a darker era of our national history
9033332 the people of pakistan would like to know what is the source of this wealth because this wealth has not been declared in mr zardaris tax returns
9033333 we had to resort to load shedding for six times because of the shortfall
9033334 centre can play a role if required if they desire to facilitate any discussion on this it will keep the investment environment in the country and west bengal alright

9033337 only about 10 per cent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 per cent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion

9033340 we do not condone any gelek gelek gyrating movements on stage
9033341 we are currently formulating a comprehensive guideline for concerts until then concerts of such nature are banned
9033342 we just do not want to allow the type of entertainment that could negatively influence people
9033343 it is best to aim a bit forward of the flys starting position to anticipate where its going to jump when it first sees your swatter
9033344 we were surprised to find that long in fly time before a fly takes off in response to a predator or swatter it plans the direction of the jump by making a rather complex series of postural movements
9033345 these movements are made very rapidly within about 200 milliseconds but within that time the animal determines where the threat is coming from and activates an appropriate set of movements to position its legs and wings
9033346 this shows how rapidly the flys brain processes sensory information into an appropriate motor response
9033347 the story is about a little boy and his best friend a donkey it is almost after 18 years that a bollywood film has been entirely shot in the valley and the experience was very overwhelming
9033348 the security personnel were friendly because we shot in winter a large crowd used to surround us all the time some women and children were very enthusiastic to work in the movie
9033349 our crew members thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful sceneries of j k at that time the valley was very peaceful and police and locals also supported us we have not imagined that when the film will be ready for release the condition would be so worse
9033350 anupam kher is a kashmiri but even he had some first time visit to some places he was very happy we also let locals to be the part of the film
9033351 the orissa government has completely failed to take steps on a war footing to stop the violence and there is no justification for it to continue in power
9033352 the violence let loose on chistians and their organisations by the vhp seems to be well planned
9033353 these bowl shaped depressions reflect the former location of relatively pure glacier ice
9033354 this late stage snow could accumulate in depressions on the crater wall and in favorable microclimate settings melt to produce the observed gullies and fans
9033355 are exciting because they establish a spatial link between recent gullies and accumulation of glacier ice strengthening the case for surface melt water flow in the formation of gullies on mars
9033356 rice production will surely touch record this year on the back of the areas sown and the overall crop condition as of now even though floods in some producing regions have hit the crop
9033357 the following problem is a quite fundamental problem in robotics
9033358 sometimes taxpayers are forced to pick up the tab by funding government spending on pollution control or they may pay indirectly for instance by funding treatment for asthmatic patients through their health insurance premiums
9033359 examples of environmental taxes include carbon taxes where industry is taxed for every unit of carbon dioxide emitted which incentivises firms to find energy efficient and low carbon alternatives congestion charges where motorists pay a fee for entering the congestion zone which encourages them to make fewer journeys in these areas and fuel duties where petrol is taxed to encourage motorists to buy more fuel efficient cars or use their cars less frequently
9033360 in australia the taxpayer is assured that no adjustment to their transfer pricing method will be made if an apa is complied with
9033361 statistical analysis shows that one extra disputed year raises legal compliance cost by 7 per cent the time taken to close an assessment varies from two years to twenty years if the tax dispute goes to the supreme court
9033362 a drug could be tested in india at a rate which is 50 to 60 per cent cheaper than in the us
9033363 the compulsory licensing regime absence of data exclusivity and the accessibility to an effective and organised distribution network are some such issues
9033364 this is great news for stroke survivors because results clearly demonstrate that long term stroke damage is not immutable and that with exercise its never too late for the brain and body to recover
9033365 this suggests that the brain is responsible for the improvement we saw in patients walking ability it seems to be recruiting other regions to take on the job of areas damaged by stroke
9033366 once developed this molecule will cause much less wheezing and shortness of breath and should be able to be given safely to the hundreds of thousands of patients with both heart and lung diseases furthermore because it will have so few side effects it has the potential to become the beta blocker of choice for all heart patients
9033367 i think this is going to be a real problem for us
9033368 that thing is almost all ash tree end to end
9033369 this is as extensive a landscaped area as we have in the village
9033370 we thought we would take the initiative and try to come up with some ideas
9033371 our intent would be wild flowers perennials things that take care of themselves and regenerate every year
9033372 we know that will be a considerable item to discuss
9033373 we will not be agreeable to any kind of ssa that would put an additional burden
9033374 now we think its our turn to get something back from the village

9033380 nanda cannot be prosecuted under section 304 when the lawmakers are undecided and seeking responses from the experts for doing away with the milder penal section 304a
9033381 the commission has sought responses from experts as to whether persons accused of drunken driving which results into death could be tried under harsher section 304 culpable homicide not amounting to murder instead of milder provision of 304a causing death by rash and negligent act

9033449 the cast i worked with had no cinematic training which i though would be useful to access things that a professional actor wouldnt be capable
9033450 usually an actor is trained to show things i thought it was important to show what a person was hiding
9033451 right up to the day of shooting i hadnt found a suitable character to play that role and i even thought about cutting her out
9033452 as it is a very masculine and male oriented society the thought of really coming out and revealing that fact they wanted to come out and revealing they are not a real male has real problems all of the women i met who wanted to be male didnt want this to be known for them it was a real problem coming out
9033453 the only way of really finding out a mans true character is to play golf with him

9033459 people probably wont know gerry but the truth of the matter is theyve probably gone to see something gerrys put on theyve probably seen a rolling stones show or u2 or gone to see david bowie or whomever
9033460 shes remarkable just because shes such an interesting personality and has so many interests wine photography architecture and corporate governance
9033461 and you probably learn something about the guy at some point whether you learn everything about his business or not you learn something more important you learn about the guy himself you learn about what makes him tick what interests him

9033465 in a corporate setting you and i are never going to see how that comes out because were never going to be invited when theyre negotiating a 30 million deal to take something over
9033466 the tricky part about it for me is how do you play a halfway decent golf game take notes and think up questions to continue the conversation
9033467 he said theres a lot of f words in this
9033468 hey where are you guys i got you delegate passes to the obama speech tonight youre in
9033469 will put the interests of black americans ahead of other americans
9033470 theres not a black america and white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america

9033478 celebrities dont have to worry about family budgets but we sure do
9033479 well yes john mccain has to worry about his family budget that budget by the way includes 273 000 a year for household help thats 50 000 more every year just for servants maids and gardeners than the median value of a family house in this country but obama son of a single mother who sometimes went on welfare who had to work his way through college hes the elitist
9033480 the bulk of obamas wealth has come only in the past few years with the huge success of his second book
9033481 t he kid who said theres no way i came from an ape looks like an ape the knuckle forward posture the hunched in head the heavy brows he looks like a gorilla this is called irony

9033483 first whether we like it or not a big part of the gay agenda for decades has been to repudiate what are regarded as overly restrictive expectations of monogamy and sexual fidelity even more unfortunately what has been happening in inner city and low income communities illustrates this all too starkly the rise of multi partner relationships as a way of life has been a major force in the decline of marriage so we should be wary of extending marriage to a community with influential people who believe that sexual monogamy isnt that important that sexually unfaithful partnerships are not such a big deal
9033484 male unemployment and low wages are primary reasons why parents do not marry why 2 parent families break up and why fathers fail to remain involved with their children
9033485 professor waxs first concern is that gay couples resist sexual monogamy and that allowing them to marry might entice heterosexuals to follow their libertine ways the force of this concern is blunted at the outset by the fact that two thirds of legally recognized same sex couples are lesbians who are famously monogamous the contagious promiscuity argument is really about guy marriage not gay marriage
9033486 more importantly theres no reason to believe that heterosexual couples model their sexual lives on gay men consider the numerical obstacle to such influence male couples will be about 1 of all marriages some will commit to monogamy others will be discreet about their non monogamy so were really talking about much less than 1 of marriages that paltry number will undermine heterosexual morals undermine them more than our super monogamous lesbian role models will reinforce them
9033487 if some tolerate philandering and that makes philandering more prevalent and more acceptable which it does and that leads to more philandering and that puts stress on relationships or creates more instability in relationships we have a problem if philandering breaks up families and produces extra marital children that the rest of us end up helping support that is what i call an impact indeed the havoc that lack of sexual restraint wreaks is very much something that affects all of us every single day
9033488 i f lots of homosexuals decide that monogamy is really not that important not an essential part of marriage which is really just about rights and getting equal recognition that is not just their business
9033489 but if you knew nothing about the gay marriage debate except what you read in this exchange youd get the impression its all about gay male sex this is odd but alas not uncommon in discussions about including homosexuals in the laws and institutions of this country forget lesbians forget children forget committed and tradition minded gay male couples who are the most likely even to want to marry all that matters is that a small number of married gay male couples may have too much sex with too many people
9033490 meanwhile what is the traditionalist response to the decades long growth of gay families including families with children so far its been malign neglect i really suspect that many traditionalists do not give much thought at all to the needs of gay families if they think about these things at all they wish it would simply go away but it is not going away
9033491 t here is a fundamental difficulty in the claim that there is too much love in the world and that we therefore must weed out love of the wrong kind
9033492 they have been moving the remaining 11 employees down to the first floor they told them it has to be done this week also they were seen moving stuff out of the building and loading box trucks only two remaining project managers and one remaining sales counselor have been spotted

9033530 if i wrote a book and said i think my stepfather is the zodiac killer they wouldnt believe me
9033531 it could be a knife he barbecued with or a knife he murdered someone with
9033532 when i first opened it up that did affect me my heart skipped a couple of beats when i saw it

9033566 they were pretty much hustled off they came right down the ramp jumped in some vans here and off they went
9033567 john mccain is going to make the choice from his heart hes going to choose someone who can be a partner in governing hes going to choose someone who brings character and principle to the table and who shares his priorities and im confident that hes going to make a great pick
9033568 i stood up to the lobbyists the big oil companies and the good old boy network
9033569 for showing such grace and determination in her campaign the women of america arent finished yet
9033570 the first middle aged non college woman should be democrats but they stayed home instead of turning out for al gore and john kerry they are all about the economy those women are not social conservatives nor are they pro gun they are definitely security conscious and so they may have an issue with someone who has two years experience being a heartbeat away from a 72 year old man thats asking a lot thats a big ask
9033571 experience should trump change they really wanted a more experienced person as president it was a bonus for these voters was that hillary was a woman because it made them proud of her and themselves but those women are social progressives i dont see them turning to mccain because of sarah palin

9033578 i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk they claim that our insistence on something larger something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values and thats to be expected because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from you make a big election about small things and you know what its worked before because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government when washington doesnt work all its promises seem empty if your hopes have been dashed again and again then its best to stop hoping and settle for what you already know i get it
9033579 we need a government that cares more about barney smith than smith barney
9033580 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
9033581 who can best help me shake up washington and make it start working again for the people who are counting on us

9033602 theres no buildup its like detention detention detention detention after school
9033603 some kids get sick some get stuck by trains on the way to school things happen the old policy was fine five tardies then a punishment it gave us a little leeway for unavoidable accidents
9033604 theres a lot of kids who were taking advantage of last years policy so now they have to punish everyone
9033605 they should find some type of medium i dont know how many tardies kids get on average so its hard for me to say its not fair to kids who are only late a couple times we should get a little leeway
9033606 not for being late to classes during the day but being late to school will be an issue as we get further into the year

9033639 caregivers have similar cortisol levels as controls their cells seem to be hearing less of this signal in other words something goes awry in caregivers white blood cells so they are not able to receive the signal from cortisol that tells them to shut down inflammation
9033640 because people have traditionally thought that higher cortisol is the reason that stress contributes to disease but this work shows that at least in caregivers its actually the opposite theres too little cortisol signal being heard by the cells rather than too much

9033650 its a federal offense to take a rock out of a national park
9033651 i dont think you need to worry about weekend hikers or casual adventurers coming up here

9033671 you dont have to like one another but its your job to love one another

9033689 i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure either he did that for a look or hes just not educated on politics

9033722 we the people in order to form a more perfect union
9033723 people began to shout to rise from their seats and clap and cry out a forceful wind carrying the reverends voice up into the rafters and in that single note hope i heard something else at the foot of that cross inside the thousands of churches across the city i imagined the stories of ordinary black people merging with the stories of david and goliath moses and pharaoh the christians in the lions den ezekiels field of dry bones those stories of survival and freedom and hope became our story my story the blood that had spilled was our blood the tears our tears until this black church on this bright day seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into future generations and into a larger world our trials and triumphs became at once unique and universal black and more than black in chronicling our journey the stories and songs gave us a means to reclaim memories that we didnt need to feel shame about memories that all people might study and cherish and with which we could start to rebuild

9033736 seriously yall ive driven through bigger than wasilla where palin got the bulk of her
9033737 wow if you dont like obamas stance on abortion good luck voting for sarah palins
9033738 completely agreed tear her apart for being laughably unqualified and frighteningly regressive in her social stances not for having recently borne young
9033739 there are many people with lots of ideas on how we can live smarter greener and sustainable lives ecorio is one piece of that mosaic
9033740 i think that the intent was to have more turnover and certainly it has done that
9033741 i dont feel as though the season the regular season has anywhere near the same impact that it had and so that could be a good thing because now we dont have to play as many events if we dont want to
9033742 positioning ourselves for the fedex cup is really not important because the last place guy if he wins vaults into first

9033744 the course is designed to bridge the gap between the realities that confront both engineering and construction professionals
9033745 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9033746 the vice president is a heartbeat away from becoming president so to choose someone with not one hours worth of experience on national issues is a dangerous choice if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9033747 thats right folks the old guy went for the hot young thing a may december political pairing of historic significance im sure hes thinking shes from alaska shes got to be in the pocket of big oil well get along fine or maybe hes counting on her hottie librarian look to appeal to all those disaffected clinton supporters either way she will be known henceforth as the geraldine ferraro of the gop
9033748 this is insulting and i feel pandered to clearly he wants to capture the voters hillary earned and he thinks a woman any woman will do
9033749 in the long run palin may help mccain win alaskas paltry 3 electoral votes but romney could have helped in colorado and nevada and tim pawlenty could have helped in minnesota i have a gut feeling that mccain just drove the straight talk express into a ditch congratulations to president barack obama
9033750 i think were of the same mind on that one the most we can hope for is a few bones as you say health care a tax cut on the middle class maybe some reform and protection of public education etc
9033751 im not disputing the facts just pointing out theres similar inconvenient facts regarding mccain and romney
9033752 perhaps my reaction is mainly a knee jerk one but i hope to zeus that i never start thinking of my marriage as an institution to be modeled after a corporation

9033757 oh my god i have to get to bed for work tomorrow ill check back in the morn
9033758 funny you should say that because my favorite parts tended to be towards the beginning and in the middle goes to show different angles and subjects appeal to different folks he covered the bases and never let up
9033759 its about time you realize youre powerless in this situation your greatest contribution would be to shut up and stay out of this

9033763 i didnt mention this before but i saw johnny kill logan in self defence and ill testify to it
9033764 we saw some seed rot before fay and even more since those rains most significantly in the earliest beans that only has impacted a small percentage of the overall crop but in those isolated areas the damage has been severe
9033765 if we get a lot of wet weather from this next system gustav much of the crop will be more susceptible to damage gustav is the one we really dont need
9033766 the more mature the crop is the less damage that can occur from soybean rust about 70 percent of our crop is past the vulnerable stages the latest planted beans will be at a greater risk
9033767 we are trusting our sentinel plots and trained scouts to alert us when it is time to treat fields that are at risk
9033768 corn growers who harvested earlier and invested in out of field drying will spend a little more on the front end but they will have a better quality crop in the long run
9033769 grain bins and heat dryers have made a difference this year
9033770 one possible saving grace for rice is that most of it was planted over several weeks and later plantings will be able to withstand storms better
9033771 we are seeing some problems with bollrot and in some cases we could see up to 10 percent yield losses

9033781 with vp2 out the door and banjo in its vinegar strokes were focusing on getting the avatars all finished and done for the new xbox experience
9033782 after that itll most likely be a mix of new projects and hopefully a banjo sequel maybe fingers crossed anyway

9033788 now that we have an accurate way to count these cells we are able to confirm what we long suspected that blacks might have a bigger army of hla specific b cells
9033789 if the recipient is not sensitized b cells represent only a patients potential for making antibodies
9033790 however about a third of patients in need of a kidney are sensitized since theyre often on their second or third transplantation and may have undergone transfusions
9033791 knowing that blacks have an increased number of hla specific b cells which increases their opportunity for antibody mediated rejection we may be able to customize treatments for black recipients to account for these differences and lessen the likelihood that the organ will be rejected
9033792 i concentrated on winning and as im starting to get a cold i was not able to think about a faster time

9033880 i was disappointed by the speech your mileage may vary of course but it was basically standard democratic convention boilerplate nothing we havent seen before from obama or for that matter every democratic presidential candidate in living memory

9033882 its just a little crazy its like a circus outside

9033888 she is going to appeal to a lot of working class women and hillary supporters
9033889 appeal to hillary supporters choosing sarah palin is an insult to hillary supporters
9033890 sarah palin is to the movement for womens equality what clarence thomas is to civil rights
9033891 sarah palin has a great deal of surface appeal at first but once americas women look behind that cheerleader smile and see at her extreme social agenda they will run the other direction
9033892 mccain picked a fan not an equal partner she has no international experience she was just fawning all over him no independence given mccains temper sarah palin probably wont challenge john mccain on any substantive issues
9033893 the only thing he is going to let her do in the white house is teach him how to use the internet
9033894 palin makes mccain look ancient out of touch and totally yesterday mccain makes her look like a perky kid each one dramatically and perfectly underscores the others weakness at least nobody can criticize obamas alleged youth and inexperience now but this is not the best team america could produce by any stretch

9033905 we have so much potential from tapping our resources here in alaska and we can do this with minimum environmental impact we have a very pro development president in president bush and yet he failed to push for opening up parts of alaska to drilling through congress and a republican controlled congress i might add
9033906 a changing environment will affect alaska more than any other state because of our location im not one though who would attribute global warming to being man made
9033907 i beg to disagree with any candidate who would say we cant drill our way out of our problem or that more supply wont ultimately affect prices of course it will affect prices

9033914 the findings of several studies on the practice of religion show further that islam exhibits an effectiveness in manifold forms that penetrates deeply into the daily life of muslims and presents a powerful force for the shaping of daily life as well as for the structuring of social relationships
9033915 a successful integration put into practice in everyday life can be identified only in somewhat more than 10
9033916 encourages young muslims to commit suicide attacks or instructs them in doing so
9033917 the use of physical violence as a reaction to the threat presented to islam by the west as legitimate

9033919 affirm the statement that democracy in germany is one of the reasons for the high rate of crime
9033920 the observance of the commandments of my religion is more important for me than democracy
9033921 absolutely substantial minority with a problematic attitude toward violence and or democracy and the rule of law
9033922 only a small minority of 6 displays a high acceptance of politically and religiously motivated violence
9033923 on the whole the results of this survey lead to the conclusion that in the muslim resident population a relevant potential on the level of personal attitudes exists that can be suitable as a ground of resonance and a field of recruitment for radicalisms and extremisms
9033924 in sum it therefore can be established that a significantly heightened acceptance of violence is connected with the affiliation with the islamic religion
9033925 if strong anti semitic or antichristian prejudices and or great distance from democracy are taken together as characteristics that define a group at risk then on the basis of the data in hand one can discern such problems for almost a quarter of young muslims 23 8 it is a matter here of a minority that is not to be underestimated and that shows clear indications of intolerance distance to democracy or authoritarian features
9033926 among the young people the potential of young muslims responsive to political radicalization up to the extent of excessive violence is noticeably higher than in the general population
9033927 thus also among the highly educated muslims as which students here must be regarded a high risk group quite definitely can be more exactly located significant here along with a religious alignment in a form that bears in itself a strong devaluation of the west and a wholesale upgrading of the value of islam is the intensive confrontation with the position of muslims in the world and the subjective perception of their discrimination and oppression
9033928 the descriptions are to a great extent interspersed with the locution of muslims as victims expressed with the most varied nuances to be sure this is substantiated to a certain extent with references to details which however in very few cases are attributed to direct personal experience dominant is the description of the situation of others who one personally knows and about which one knows
9033929 i am treated here and looked upon as though i am a terrorist as though one is a constant threat only because i come to prayer
9033930 there is such an effort to discriminate against muslim women that almost nothing any more can be done with a headscarf thus one becomes aggressive
9033931 developed a distinct feeling of being increasingly in the focus of observation and always being exposed to the danger of being placed under the suspicion of islamism and of struggling against democratic structures
9033932 an accommodation of his conduct or the conduct of other muslims to the rules of the receiving german society is in his eyes an unacceptable imposition
9033933 exclusion deprecation and oppression of muslims on a national as well as international level
9033934 in sum a quite considerable portion of the muslims living in germany students as well as the general muslim population is convinced that the community of muslims in the global sense is discriminated against and treated poorly
9033935 fundamentalist orientations that combine a close religious attachment a high relevance of religion in daily life and a strong orientation on religious rules and rituals with a tendency to exclude muslims who do not observe these as well as with the tendency generally to heighten the value of islam and to derogate western christian influenced cultures show an enormous dissemination in the general population about 40 are to be assigned to such a pattern of orientation
9033936 it seems to be the case that this search for meaning and the struggle for values requires a dialogue and credible dialogue partners who on the one hand do not dismiss islam and also do not encounter it with an arbitrary attitude but rather themselves are strong dialogue partners standing upon a solid foundation

9034046 were headed to the next adventure out on the plains of meridiani
9034047 we safely got into the crater we completed our exploration there and we safely got out we were concerned that any wheel failure on our aging rover could have left us trapped inside the crater
9034048 as we near what we originally expected to be the full length of the mission we are all thrilled with how well the mission is going
9034049 in the first two cells we analyzed samples from the surface and the ice interface and the results look similar our objective for cell 3 is to use it as an exploratory cell to look at something that might be different
9034050 the appeal of stone soup is that this deep area may collect and concentrate different kinds of materials
9034051 the trough between polygons is sort of a trap where things can accumulate
9034052 over a long timescale there may even be circulation of material sinking at the margins and rising at the center
9034053 we had a shootout between stone soup and white stuff in a trench called upper cupboard
9034054 if we had been able to confirm that the white material was a salt rich deposit we would have analyzed that but we were unable to confirm that with various methods

9034062 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs
9034063 the steps taken by the alaska state legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs
9034064 we in alaska feel that crunch and are taking steps to address it right here at home
9034065 this is a tool that must be on the table to buy us time until our long term energy plans can be put into place we have already enjoyed the support of alaska senator ted stevens and it is gratifying to see senator obama get on board

9034074 weve got people flying in from all over the world
9034075 because they were closing we decided to do it now
9034076 its really a shame and from the people we talk to staff and people alike it seems that everybodys kind of puzzled why its closing because it seems very popular
9034077 theres a tremendous amount of sadness as you can imagine this is a place that no one wants to end including our employees
9034078 it goes beyond just a great group of staff its a group of people whove invested everything they had to make this as realistic and special as possible

9034085 we also asked whether apples recent release of its 3g iphone has made respondents more or less likely to buy an apple mac computer in the future
9034086 a total of 17 say theyre now more likely to buy an apple laptop or desktop in the future because of the 3g iphone only 1 said less likely these very positive findings point to the strong likelihood that the 3g iphone is having at least some halo effect on mac sales going forward
9034087 its a cool feeling to have that kind of support
9034088 there is no doubt that iphone 2 0 x software is buggier and slower in contact browsing for instance not internet speed
9034089 its probably best not to pull the handle off as it will break
9034090 there is no technical reason that a third party could not accumulate and assemble the hardware components in an apple labeled computer hardware system such that said system would be capable of running the mac os
9034091 the kernel panic is self induced by apples embedding of code to prevent operability on computer hardware systems that are not apple labeled computer hardware systems
9034092 the mac os market is distinct and unique as compared to other operating systems including but not limited to the windows operating system
9034093 as such psystar alleges that the windows operating system is not and cannot be considered an effective substitute for the mac os the same holds true for any other operating system
9034094 apple is free to control and charge customers supra competitive prices
9034095 apple has at the least substantially lessened competition in the mac os capable computer hardware systems marketplace if not eliminated it in its entirety and as a result maintains its monopoly position with respect to the mac os and the artificially created apple labeled computer hardware system
9034096 certainly if you bought it two days ago there was no reason to hang around and speculate as to what happens over the weekend

9034108 its surprising that relatively little hurricane premium has been added to the market perhaps its because refiners are at present running only at 87 percent of capacity compared to running at 97 percent when hurricane katrina hit
9034109 could be that at present demand destruction is the engine thats driving the complex lower while at katrinas time of impact in august 2005 the talk was all about runaway demand
9034110 right now there is still uncertainty on where exactly gustav will hit and so it is difficult to determine the damage that the storm might bring
9034111 the dollar is up and so were seeing prices of crude move down from the highs remember that in 2005 the market sold off hard before katrinas arrival and then rallied again when it hit
9034112 dude remember that treaty and the whole oh we promise we arent going to go anywhere outside of this small band of land we are using as a way to get from one side of the dakotas to the other thing you swore yeah see those black hills you and custer are standing on not part of the deal best circle your wagons because im about to burn them down and adopt your children into my tribe

9034127 heres to alcohol the cause of and solution to all of lifes problems
9034128 is personnel who have medical capabilities who can do whats necessary to diagnose people and take care of them
9034129 theyre working hard to get the people to come back who are trained and outside
9034130 and mostly those are senior folks that can come in and teach and help get things back on what we would call a direct road for taking care of folks
9034131 right now its a matter of can you pay what i can make someplace else
9034132 but that said theres a lot of these people who want to come home

9034144 its my belief given the improvement in the security situation in iraq that there will be a continued withdrawal of u s forces as promised by gen petraeus at his last congressional hearing later this fall
9034145 my sense is that i will be able to make a recommendation at that time for some further reductions

9034168 yeah i have furs on my wall but i dont wear furs i had to show them my bunny boots and my north face clothing
9034169 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges
9034170 lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9034171 sarah palin for her entire political career has been underestimated
9034172 shes tough shes tenacious i believe that she does have what it takes to get out there again her ability to connect with voters and make a case is very very very strong
9034173 without such a channel for contacts we will have difficulties trying to bring our points of view to each others attention

9034184 dont you worry about the distance im right there if you get lonely
9034185 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like no 1 probably not but i cant judge too much on that because i really havent had chance to practice
9034186 this kind of loss i had today is just incentive to work harder to go back on the court and to keep working hard and practicing and improving
9034187 i thought i can slowly get into the match and she played completely different than i expected
9034188 she was serving extremely well and hitting very powerful shots so i really struggled and made too many unforced errors and my serve was not working really well in the third set i created a lot of opportunities for myself just didnt quite use them that was very very frustrating
9034189 maybe i was a little bit also too hard on myself at some moments
9034190 many people said i have the best draw as i ever had in the last two or three years because i never really had good draws especially in the grand slams

9034206 were taking many many steps to be environmentally sensitive the way we look at the environment is many small steps by a lot of people add up to a big impact thats part of what were doing right now the racing industry is all about performance the fact that we have a new product that is better for the environment and equal if not better performance on the racetrack is really a win win for all of us

9034208 7 eleven is one of the cornerstones of andretti green racing and were thrilled to extend our agreement with them weve accomplished a lot together but we feel like we can do even bigger things in the future the team 7 eleven car has been a fixture at the top level of the indycar series since it debuted in 2003 and we expect to keep it there for a long time
9034209 we joined forces when andretti green began racing in 2003 the year tony joined the agr team and have worked together over the last five years to build an even stronger 7 eleven brand through this international platform tony exemplifies the leadership team orientation and values we embrace at 7 eleven and has been a terrific spokesperson the unification of open wheel racing earlier this year has made the indycar series even more relevant to our customers were looking forward to enjoying future successes together
9034210 this morning was pretty good i had a problem with hitting the wall twice and bent the tow link we actually had to repair the car in the middle of the session and had to end early because we had to fix it the car was actually quick out of the box i think we were quickest in the first 10 minutes but we had a lot of understeer we tried dialing it out and made the car a lot worse we put a set of stickers new tires on the car and it was pretty average i think the car can be a little bit quicker and using the baseline setup from this morning it should have been quicker helio is quite fast but i dont know if the track changed because of the weather a lot of people seemed to have a lot of understeer during the session
9034211 its been a little busy today with me doing double duty briscoe is running both the indycar series and alms events at belle isle this weekend today was the first day ive been around this track in an indycar and i think practice went really well team penske made some good progress and i learned a lot today so now i think we just have to go back and figure out what we need to do to be a little quicker tomorrow

9034217 the car felt really good today during both practice sessions the key to all road courses is track position so hopefully we can get the motorola car into the firestone fast six tomorrow and have a good finish i feel really good about this weekend

9034294 george bushs own energy department has said that if we opened up new areas of drilling today we wouldnt see a single drop of oil for 7 years
9034295 i also believe that in the short term as we transition to renewable energy we can and should increase our domestic production of oil and natural gas but we should start by telling the oil companies to drill on the 68 million acres they currently have access to but havent touched and if they dont we should require them to give up their leases to someone who will we should invest in the technology that can help us recover more from existing oil fields and speed up the process of recovering oil and gas resources in shale formations in montana and north dakota texas and arkansas and in parts of the west and central gulf of mexico we should sell 70 million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process

9034333 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
9034334 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro l orizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
9034335 ogni santa notte ogni volta che chiudo gli occhi lei li ogni volta che la mia mente vuota lei la occupa oh wiliam quando tu non ci sei io mi sento cos inutile cos debole e lei mi logora dallinterno mi sento come se fossi divisa in miliardi di coriandoli tutti senza senso e tu non so come riesci a dargli quel senso riesci a farmi sentire che esisto quando invece io non so pi chi sono non lo so pi
9034336 ho visto te fra lei sue braccia ho sentito il male che ti ha fatto dalla prima volta che sei entrato in questa stanza penso che questa sia colpa tua
9034337 tu hai risvegliato la parte peggiore di me quella che mi faceva male ho rivisto frammenti del suo e del tuo passato ho visto come la guardavi ed anche se non volevo credere che fossi tu quel ragazzo inconsciamente io invidiavo natalie perch so che non potrai mai guardarmi come guardavi lei
9034338 ho sentito la sua perfidia lei mi perseguita mi dice che non sono niente e che tu gli apparterrai per leternit
9034339 ero gi un vampiro allepoca lei non lo sapeva o almeno io non glielo avevo confessato me ne innamorai perdutamente nellistante i cui la vidi
9034340 era bellissima fui superficiale a limitarmi allapparenza cominciai a frequentare il suo castello ogni giorno ogni notte sorgeva proprio qui questa era la sua stanza
9034341 decisi di dirle la verit ero stupidamente sicuro che lei mi amasse solo ora so quanto mi stessi sbagliando non so come ma venne a conoscenza della mia natura da sola allepoca circolavano strane dicerie sui vampiri si diceva che mangiando le nostre carni si poteva ottenere limmortalit senza linconveniente della dannazione
9034342 ma io non volevo vedere non volevo sentire volevo solo lei lultima sera che la vidi nella sua stanza fui attaccato da un esercito di vampiri allora non potevo pi sfuggire dalla realt
9034343 ero forte ma non cos forte per sfuggire ad un esercito lei era li di fronte a me mentre gli altri mi tenevano in modo che non potessi sfuggire non so come riusc a farsi ubbidire da quei vampiri non so nemmeno cosa promise loro in cambio mi disse il suo desiderio ed il suo intento mi aveva venduto ad una nobile famiglia del tempo in cambio di qualche trancio della mia carne lei voleva limmortalit la bellezza eterna lunica cosa importante per lei mi disse che avrebbe mangiato le miei carni che in questo modo avrebbe esaudito anche il mio desiderio essere parte di lei per sempre capii che era pazza che ero stato uno stupido a cercare qualcosa di cos profondo come lamore in una come lei ale era cos fredda cos vuota
9034344 mi fece rinchiudere nelle segrete del suo palazzo quello fu il suo unico errore piegai le sbarre di quella prigione avevo un solo desiderio ucciderla
9034345 rotornai nelle sue stanze alla mia vista i suoi occhi si riempirono di paura di terrore e ne fui felice perch in qualche modo ero riuscito a fargliprovare almeno unemozione alla fine non fui in grado di ucciderla
9034346 la baciai unultima volta cercando di trasmetterle tutto lodio che avevo tutto il ribrezzo me ne andai e non la rividi mai pi ora so cosa le accadde
9034347 lunica cosa che seppi dopo essermene andato che il suo esercito fin col distruggersi da solo soltanto uno si salv a quello scempio gli augur di subire tutte le pene dellinferno gli promise che lavrebbe perseguitata ovunque in ongi vita qualunque forma avesse assunto lui lavrebbe perseguitata sarebbe stato la sua paura pi grande
9034348 poi mi allontanai cos tanto da quel luogo da questo luogo che lei per me non divenne altro che un amaro ricordo un ricordo nitido del mio orgoglio ferito del mio cuore infranto un ricordo che mi perseguitava ed al quale non potevo sottrarmi la mia punizione per aver assaggiato il frutto proibito poi decisi di tornare ed te che ho incontrato tu risvegliasti tutto quel dolore che mi sembrava di tenere sepolto tu eri identica a lei to odiai per questo ti odiai con tutte le mie forze inizialmente pensavo addirittura che tu fossi lei che in qualche modo era riuscita a restare in vita io lo speravo
9034349 gi non sei nemmeno lontanamente paragonabile a lei per fortuna
9034350 e tu mi portasti qui qui dove tutto era cominciato decisi allora che qui anche tutto sarebbe finito ma tu non eri una normale ragazza di questa epoca
9034351 avvertisti subito la mia presenza e questo mi spavent ma ormai avevo deciso tu mi avresti liberato da tutte le mie pene poi a tutto questo si aggiunse il tuo profumo cos dolce cos intenso e la ciliegina sulla torta pensai sarebbe stato tutto pi semplice naturale io ero il vampiro tu la preda ma i tuoi occhi il tuo modo di fare il dubbio cominci a d insinuarsi nei miei pensieri tu non eri lei mi sentii un mostro eppure capii immediatamente di non essere pi capace di allontanarmi da te tu eri una perfida illusione per me lillusione che natalie fosse ancora li per me che fosse diversa

9034601 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9034602 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9034603 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9034604 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9034605 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano

9034608 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale

9034626 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9034627 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9034628 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9034629 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza

9034643 that they have not proliferated in great numbers may be due to their inability to provide for themselves especially if they have been kept as produce animals for generations

9034735 we are ridiculously excited to be hitting the states for the first time until now our bands closest experience to being in america was standing on the canadian side of niagara falls peeking across the water at buffalo ny so we literally cannot wait to start playing american shows its part of every british bands dream to tour in the us and the fact that we get to do it alongside such big and crushing names as suicide silence and emmure is simply awesome we just recently finished recording our new album hollow crown which were really really stoked on and were psyched to be shaking off the studio tan by playing some new tunes for american crowds at these shows alongside some tracks off ruin of course we love crowd interaction it really feeds our live show so if you know the words get down the front and well have a good fucking time see you there
9034736 it also allowed us to connect to their networks of non best buy people
9034737 figuring these extended networks have similar interests to those working for us already this seemed an easy way to use the dynamic of how information spreads through facebook to a recruiting and employment branding end we also wanted a place to post why youd want to work here kind of stuff like photos discussions and articles we felt this would allow people interested in potentially working for best buy to get a better feel for the real culture and what the actual employees were talking about far beyond what could be communicated via a job posting or banner ad
9034738 they were trying to come up with a way to get real time front line feedback on varioius promotions that were being developed at corporate and run in the stores
9034739 they shopped the idea for an internal social network around corporate but couldnt get sponsorship for it so they just did it themselves neither of them were programmers or developers just creative and smart they started it using
9034740 after 14 days of recording madness grave digger finished the recordings for ballads of a hangman the final master will be ready around the 15th of september we hope that you will like the new album which will be released on january 9th 2009 before we will release an ep on november 28th 2008
9034741 as we all know niche job boards are the future of online recruitment business keeping this in mind weve built a flexible platform that could be easily customized for any niche users can add job and fields they need and modify search forms and results for their specific online service
9034742 weve also added community features such as user comments and ratings of job and resume postings since these are essential parts of modern recruitment web sites
9034743 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9034744 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9034745 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9034746 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9034747 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9034748 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9034749 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9034750 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9034751 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9034752 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9034753 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9034754 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9034755 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9034756 doesnt know how its going to manifest itself to the public
9034757 today were announcing that beginning on oct 1 2008 we will amend our acceptable use policy aup available at and establish a specific monthly data usage threshold of 250 gb month per account for all residential customers
9034758 we recognize that service providers have to manage their networks but they must do so in way that addresses the issue that has come to their attention and that approach must be narrowly tailored
9034759 in the past there was clearly a cap but it was invisible users would know they had violated the cap only when they received a letter saying they were using the network excessively
9034760 basically you could exceed the cap with watching four hours of hd high definition quality television i can easily imagine a family of heavy internet users exceeding the cap
9034761 the fcc also expects them to make a filing with a detailed plan outlining not only what they intend to do but what their practices were when they were blocking bittorrent
9034762 i dont see the fcc releasing its bite on comcast with just this plan comcast is still faced with opposing the fccs order of disclosing its past practices
9034763 the user has full control with the rating and permissions system weve set up by using a feedback system similar to users will be able to see the higher quality rated apps with the permissions model users are able to view the areas the app will access on their device and choose whether or not to install
9034764 the basis of competition is where its likely to be interesting both in terms of the quantity and quality of applications but maybe even more importantly in terms of the ease of use
9034765 thats where apple with their iphone app store seems to have really struck a nerve theyve made it incredibly easy for users of the device to get at the applications
9034766 one of the great successes for the iphone is that its been very successfully placed in carriers catalogs around the world theres not a clear picture yet for android based devices
9034767 as an industry we need to begin setting some basic common sense standards that reward pc gamers for purchasing our games
9034768 the console market effectively already has something like this in that its games have to go through the platform maker such as nintendo microsoft or sony but on the pc publishers can release games that are scarcely completed poorly supported and full of intrusive copy protection and then be stuck on it
9034769 this is an awesome framework for the industry to aspire to and ultimately so that we can provide our customers with the gaming experience that they have wanted for years and really deserve
9034770 the pc market loses out on a lot of sales because a significant percentage of our market has pcs that may or may not be adequate to run our games without the ability to return games to the publisher for a refund many potential buyers simply pass on games they might otherwise have bought due to the risk of not being certain a game will work on their pc the average consumer doesnt know what pixel shader 2 0 support means for instance
9034771 pirates would have absolutely no credible excuses to download games beyond i m a cheap bastard
9034772 n s achamos que seria uma boa oportunidade de competir a s rio antes do in cio da volvo um barco diferente mas com um tamanho parecido e uma regata n s precisamos velejar juntos ent o esta uma tima oportunidade

9034776 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9034777 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9034778 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9034779 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9034780 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9034781 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9034782 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9034783 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9034784 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9034785 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9034786 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9034787 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9034788 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9034789 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9034790 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9034791 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9034792 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9034793 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9034794 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9034795 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9034796 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9034797 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9034798 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9034799 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9034800 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9034801 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9034802 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9034803 you know if they made a mistake i would not want them to be punished with a baby
9034804 a lifetime member of the nra she enjoys hunting fishing
9034805 the selection of governor palin is great news for conservatives for the party and for the country her dedication to principle her courage both before and after her election as governor of alaska and her personal qualities make her a perfect choice for vice president i predict any conservatives who have been lukewarm thus far in their support of the mccain candidacy will work their hearts out between now and november for the mccain palin ticket
9034806 i am absolutely delighted by this selection once again john mccain has shown that he is an independent thinker who paints in bold strokes sarah palin is a conservative reformer with executive experience who will bring a breath of fresh air to washington she will be an ideal running mate for john mccain and will make a major contribution to our countrys future
9034807 senator kennedy killed that girl the same as if he put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger
9034808 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia
9034809 with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds
9034810 how did it come about that highly sensitive technical information was given to the chinese why did the president ignore the national security experts who counseled against this deal what damage has been done to our national security
9034811 lone ranger work has taken him dangerously close to the neighborhood of what we used to call treason
9034812 indeed some of israels best friends and most articulate defenders can be found in the blogosphere little green footballs atlas shrugs hugh hewitt and debbie schlussel all provide a refreshing alternative to the moral relativism and politically correct anti israel blather of the media
9034813 we are perishing for want of wonder not for want of wonders
9034814 if you can become aware of the miraculousness which i symbolise you can help save the freedom mankind is unhappily losing
9034815 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9034816 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9034817 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9034818 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9034819 ladies and gentlemen ive learned there is a powerful hurricane brewing in the gulf of mexico aimed at new orleans if it makes landfall the destruction could be widespread and devastating
9034820 thats why today i am announcing i will be out of town this weekend

9034832 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9034833 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

9034855 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9034856 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9034857 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9034858 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9034859 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9034860 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9034861 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9034862 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9034863 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9034864 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9034865 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9034866 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9034867 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9034868 who are open to doing something on the production side
9034869 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9034870 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9034871 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9034872 yeah my husband thought i was kidding about that but i wasnt so i had to use our codeword to let him know that i was serious

9035034 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us

9035067 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9035068 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9035069 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9035070 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9035071 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9035072 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9035073 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop

9035075 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9035076 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9035077 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9035078 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9035079 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with

9035084 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9035085 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9035086 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9035087 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9035088 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9035089 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful

9035091 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9035092 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9035093 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9035094 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9035095 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9035096 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9035097 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9035098 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9035099 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9035100 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9035101 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9035102 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9035103 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9035104 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9035105 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9035106 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9035107 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9035108 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9035109 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9035110 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9035111 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9035112 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9035113 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9035114 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9035115 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9035116 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9035117 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9035118 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9035119 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9035120 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9035121 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9035122 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9035123 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9035124 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9035125 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9035126 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9035127 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9035128 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9035129 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9035130 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9035131 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9035132 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9035133 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9035134 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9035135 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses

9035150 the sad reality is that nobody can offer a 100 percent guarantee of your childs safety when they step onto that school bus
9035151 but as a parent you can identify whether your school district has taken specific steps to reduce the risk of a bus accident

9035179 its her choice yes but the one she made is in my mind not indicative of the outcome id like to see someone who is potentially going to be leading this country
9035180 that is why her decision bothers me because it indicates to me that she does not demonstrate an ability to make an informed decision
9035181 her choice to take a job like the vp is either abandonment of a minimal parental duty or negligence on the job househubby will raise the kids but really wouldnt it be prudent not to assume a massive amount of new duties now that she and her husband have a 4 month old with downs as well as 3 other at home kids shes exercised the choice to have the child and i support her right to choose to bear the child and to expect some societal support ie special education now she needs to get realistic

9035292 she is a tough conservative reformer who has spent her time in office shaking up the status quo gov palin is a true leader who will be ready to serve our country on day one
9035293 sen mccain picked a running mate with an excellent record of accomplishment in gov palin
9035294 this is an historic day for the republican party and the united states of america
9035295 ive never been more proud of my friend john mccain who made a wise and bold choice for his running mate in governor sarah palin

9035304 i didnt think the iphone had been released in jordan yet
9035305 no question tom is one of the most talented and respected basketball coaches to ever coach the game
9035306 he was the kind of person who treated everyone fairly he was as good a person as ive ever been associated with at the university of iowa
9035307 one of the things that helped that team was a trip set up to south korea and china the summer before i inherited that trip but it gave me a chance to get a feel for what the players could do and it set the table for the whole season it also helped the team see that we wanted to run and press at the time there werent many teams that visited china and i dont think we would have had a successful season like that if we hadnt taken the trip
9035308 the one thing those numbers point out is that its a tough job and its tough to last very long because of the pressures and circumstances
9035309 my coaching record isnt something that dominates in my mind the league was very strong during that period
9035310 the fact that i was a midwesterner was a big reason i became interested in the iowa job it had some appeal to my family too to come back to the midwest and come back to our roots i got good vibrations talking with director of athletics bump elliott and after touring the campus i could see that this would be a great place to work
9035311 the fact that i was a midwesterner was a big reason i became interested in the iowa job

9035313 the impact that had on all of us was devastating
9035314 the impact it had on the team the university and the state what it did to all of us who experienced that and how it impacted the program
9035315 you feel good and no doubt it gives you something to watch when you pick up the sports sheet
9035316 in most cases those guys were with me a long long time
9035317 i think the world of coach ferentz and what hes done another part of the story when you talk about success at iowa is how well the coaches in all the sports got along it was a good family atmosphere
9035318 he asks out of courtesy because he wants the old man to feel good
9035319 of course they did a nice job and won too 20 10 overall 2 1 in the ncaa tournament that last team i had at iowa was a nice blend of younger and older guys and i admired the spirit they had
9035320 i think the world of coach ferentz and what hes done
9035321 another part of the story when you talk about success at iowa is how well the coaches in all the sports got along it was a good family atmosphere

9035330 with all our freedoms in america today its hard to believe that while we are entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness we have not yet secured the right to be naked in public this sad truth was driven home recently when
9035331 the state of employee engagement 2008 study explores workplace attitudes among employees on four continents and is based on responses of more than 7 500 individuals and interviews with 40 senior human resource and line managers
9035332 compared with employees in other functions it workers are unusually independent and tend to identify more with their profession than with the organization
9035333 at the same time they are achievement oriented and keen on staying current in their field and this holds true in all regions studied so it wasnt a surprise to learn that by a clear margin the opportunity for training and development is the most important driver of increased performance for it employees
9035334 while organizations are keen to maximize the contribution of each individual people need to find purpose and satisfaction in what they do full engagement develops from an alignment of maximum job satisfaction with maximum job contribution
9035335 it employees are promoted mostly due to their technical proficiency and so they want continuous development and growth but their leadership and management skills may be limited and development has to address these dimensions too career development opportunities are the top driver of retention for it professionals they will stay if they think they can grow but they will surely leave if they dont see advancement
9035336 these people are key to a companys competitiveness and need to be managed and recognized in a unique way most are highly talented even rebellious at times the brightest minds can be an organizations biggest headache

9035361 democrats are so magnanimous in victory as they were after watergate they did nothing after the iran contra scandal they did nothing but what democrats are going to want to do is get on with positive programs to fix the damage that has been done by the bush administration but i view this as part of that positive change finding out who hijacked the department of justice and who used it as a political weapon
9035362 i went to bed the winner the media had been sent home the pollworkers had been sent home the party chairmen had been given their copies of the election results and then after midnight a light went on in the basement of the capitol the basement of the courthouse in the sheriffs office and 5 200 votes that were mine were shifted to my opponent
9035363 look if this doesnt happen now its not going to happen afterwards
9035364 exclusive video interview gov don siegelman on stolen elections roves contempt and the magnanimous democrats
9035365 were headed to the next adventure out on the plains of meridiani
9035366 we safely got into the crater we completed our exploration there and we safely got out we were concerned that any wheel failure on our aging rover could have left us trapped inside the crater

9035369 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
9035370 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
9035371 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
9035372 experiments in high tech edutainment engaging students in a media rich popular culture course

9035374 some 12 years ago my husband got sick i had never seen a person so sick outside of a hospital his fevers were so severe that when they broke the bed sheets were sopping wet he couldnt keep anything in his stomach we battled to keep him hydrated
9035375 he wasnt alone in his misery he was among a small group of people who contracted salmonella when a restaurant cook failed to properly clean a cutting board where raw chicken had been cut
9035376 so it surprises me when theres such outcry when the food and drug administration approves a practice to help make our food safer
9035377 as soon as fda officials made the announcement critics were all over the airwaves claiming radiation makes food less nutritious and potentially toxic
9035378 as canada grapples with a deadly outbreak of listeriosis a leading food safety expert says the federal government has not done enough to educate pregnant women and seniors about the potential dangers of eating deli meats
9035379 there are a number of food safety tips and fact sheets and a lot of consumer education on this
9035380 the cdc data show existing efforts to reduce fodborne illness have stalled we need new messages using new media to really create a culture that values microbiologically safe food
9035381 the media monitoring team here at the canadian food inspection agency has been asked by our director to start monitoring reputable food safety related blogs
9035382 i was wondering if you would happen to have a prepared list of any of these sites and if so if you would be willing to share these with us
9035383 i once again wish to express my deepest personal sympathies to those canadians who have been affected by this tragedy while this is the most unfortunate of events possible i absolutely do not believe that this is a failure of the canadian food safety system or the regulators
9035384 certainly knowing that there is a desire to assign blame i want to reiterate that the buck stops right here
9035385 as ive said before maple leaf foods is 23 000 people who live in a culture of food safety we have an unwavering commitment to keep our food safe and we have excellent systems and processes in place but this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
9035386 a comprehensive study done at the university of regina gave canada one of five superior ratings out of 17 top tier oecd countries in a world review of food safety this highlights that listeria is a particularly challenging bacteria for the entire food industry to manage including the united states and europe simply because it is pervasive
9035387 did the surveillance system work no independent voice has said so yet and it is hard to see why mr clements or mr clarkes word should be taken at face value the two year old public health agency which reports to mr clement has yet to distinguish itself for independence and everyone government health officials and the company involved maple leaf foods inc considered it enough that the first warning of possible contamination went out to distributors not the public for four days the loop was closed whether that was the right or the wrong approach it does not do much for the publics confidence in canadas food safety system
9035388 federal health minister tony clement says the recent tainted meat outbreak that killed six people and caused at least 14 more serious illnesses is a shining example of how well canadas food inspection system works
9035389 if this is what clement calls a success story id hate to see what he considers a system failure i dont think six deaths and 14 serious illnesses is anything to be proud of
9035390 as canadas chief public health officer i want to update canadians on the state of the ongoing listeriosis outbreak
9035391 we are all understandably concerned whenever we hear that something as precious as the food we eat may pose a danger years of effort to ensure safe and secure food supplies have allowed us to be confident in what we eat
9035392 while not everything is preventable fortunately there are some simple steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of illness for ourselves and our families
9035393 canadians should be confident that the government of canada through the
9035394 we can never be completely immune to the risk of contaminations and outbreaks even with the best food safety system in the world that is why we operate surveillance and other systems to identify potential outbreaks and do the detective work that helps us to find the cause and stop further problems and what we learn from each experience helps us to improve the system further
9035395 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
9035396 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
9035397 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
9035398 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
9035399 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
9035400 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
9035401 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
9035402 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
9035403 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
9035404 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

9035407 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
9035408 as we near what we originally expected to be the full length of the mission we are all thrilled with how well the mission is going
9035409 in the first two cells we analyzed samples from the surface and the ice interface and the results look similar our objective for cell 3 is to use it as an exploratory cell to look at something that might be different
9035410 the appeal of stone soup is that this deep area may collect and concentrate different kinds of materials
9035411 the trough between polygons is sort of a trap where things can accumulate
9035412 over a long timescale there may even be circulation of material sinking at the margins and rising at the center
9035413 we had a shootout between stone soup and white stuff in a trench called upper cupboard
9035414 if we had been able to confirm that the white material was a salt rich deposit we would have analyzed that but we were unable to confirm that with various methods

9035434 in a dangerous world it is john mccain who will lead americas friends and allies in preventing iran from acquiring nuclear weapons
9035435 it was john mccain that cautioned long ago about the harm that russian aggression could do to georgia and to the world oil markets it was senator mccain who refused to hedge his support for our troops in iraq regardless of those political costs

9035438 theyre very popular with conservatives especially social conservatives and theyre real reformers theyve begun to do in baton rouge and juneau what many voters would like to see done in washington principled conservatism and vigorous reform could be a winning combination
9035439 mccain himself is intrigued by the bolder possibilities of youth or bipartisanship
9035440 and he could be especially intrigued by sarah palin and meg whitman i run into plenty of moderate and conservative women who dont consider themselves feminists but would be pleased to see a qualified woman on the ticket

9035448 this is a potentially revolutionary advance in the field of forensics
9035449 by employing the powers of genomic technology it is now possible to know with near certainty that a particular individual was at a particular location even with only trace amounts of dna and even if dozens or even hundreds of others were there too
9035450 as technology advances we need to be prepared to keep evidence that down the road could prove again to be useful
9035451 it opens up a whole new can of worms of whats possible to do forensically
9035452 we demonstrate an approach for rapidly and sensitively determining whether a trace amount of genomic dna from an individual is present within a complex dna mixture

9035560 however the analysis is still ongoing and no decisions have yet been made
9035561 its my belief given the improvement in the security situation in iraq that there will be a continued withdrawal of u s forces as promised by gen petraeus at his last congressional hearing later this fall
9035562 my sense is that i will be able to make a recommendation at that time for some further reductions
9035563 but i do believe there will be certain assets that as we are already looking at the picture right now well be able to recommend can be either redeployed or not deployed to the theater in the fall
9035564 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9035565 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9035566 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9035567 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9035568 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9035569 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9035570 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9035571 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9035572 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9035573 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9035574 this is shrimp we lookin at here this is schools of shrimp
9035575 we going through a swamp im workin on top of where my grandfathers walked they was hunting on this very spot where im catching shrimp can you imagine
9035576 i would say im in them i know im in them i know they gonna be a little while and they all belong to the lil rick
9035577 look like about 1 500 pounds of shrimp on the drag
9035578 while i was up there i was fussing fussing and raising heck just fussing at that hurricane i was furious out of my mind angry
9035579 i dropped them booms down and said let it blow blow blow blow and let me tell you that she did she blew blew blew blew
9035580 thirty forty people that slept on this boat that first night
9035581 hundreds of people just lined up on the bayou floating on boats you look at the movie
9035582 you know thats disturbing to hear these people crying could you imagine hearing these people crying for four five days and it never did stop
9035583 i play the horn to calm em down and make em see a little laugh come out of these poor people that was crying
9035584 my biggest flashback is thinkin about my daddy he committed suicide put a rope on his neck and committed suicide three months after the hurricane i lose my daddy yknow its just one of them it added to the problem we already had
9035585 a day like today he catches 1 500 pounds of shrimp but hes gonna go to the dock now and get a dollar and a half a pound
9035586 and where you and i live those same shrimp are showing up in the supermarket for 16 50 a pound
9035587 somebodys making money but its not the gulf shrimper and this its an endangered species
9035588 thats right and the culture that in a strange way its sort of knitted into the fabric of the landscape
9035589 once its gone you cant put it back together again
9035590 the good you know hard down family people is gone
9035591 to investigate the circumstances and events surrounding the termination of former public safety commissioner monegan and potential abuses of power and or improper actions by members of the executive branch
9035592 todd and sarah are scratching their heads why on earth hasnt this why is this guy still representing the department hes a horrible recruiting tool you know
9035593 ironically the participant in the affiliate program whose original objective was to drive traffic to the fake security softwares site may in fact start receiving so much traffic due to the combination of traffic acquisition tactics that
9035594 ive blogged before about the problem of google adwords pushing antivirus xp antivirus 2008
9035595 dont burn your bridges with people because you just never know when or where youll be and might need them
9035596 he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
9035597 he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it
9035598 his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame
9035599 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9035600 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9035601 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9035602 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9035603 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9035604 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9035605 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9035606 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9035607 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9035608 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9035609 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9035610 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9035611 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9035612 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9035613 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9035614 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9035615 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9035616 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9035617 there is strong potential that hanna will move around the bottom of a high pressure area currently over the east through the straits of florida and into the gulf of mexico where it could become another major hurricane by late next week
9035618 if something goes wrong and you pout or get upset and people see it then they are going to be uncomfortable
9035619 we are the busiest weve ever been period all four services all of our instructors have done multiple deployments
9035620 the op tempo is going going going we bring the veterans here because they have the knowledge of whats going on in theater we also try to give them time to decompress
9035621 it is inherently a physical exercise but its also intellectual
9035622 if you are in 80 pounds of kevlar and ceramic plates it will take its toll on you
9035623 its like a workout you are soaked in sweat and your ability to think and act is inhibited its something you have to work through the physical exhaustion and the heat
9035624 you drive past that wall run past it every day and its a reminder that i have to do my best every day to limit the number of names up there
9035625 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9035626 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9035627 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9035628 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9035629 especially if its one we can direct particularly at those people who live in trailer parks and tract housing and dont be so hard on your own people
9035630 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9035631 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9035632 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9035633 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9035634 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9035635 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9035636 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9035637 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9035638 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9035639 inspired by god the bible is truth without any mixture of error
9035640 a pastor a priest a rabbi certainly they have the freedom to say whatever they want to say and you know thank the lord that we do have that freedom of speech faith is very important to so many of us here in america and i would never support any government effort to stifle our freedom of religion or freedom of expression or freedom of speech you know i would just caution maybe a pastor to be very careful if theyre in front of a congregation and they decide to endorse one candidate over another you know there may be some frustration with that candidacy endorsement being made manifest by a few fewer dollars in the offering plate so i would just offer that bit of caution laughing but no ill tell you freedom of speech is so precious and its worth defending and of course freedom of religion and freedom of expression will be things that i will fight for
9035641 governor palin is a vice presidential selection which shows that john mccain at the age of 72 today is still able to think outside the box governor palin will delight the republican base she is pro life it appears that senator obama played it safe in picking senator biden and senator mccain made the bold and unconventional choice in picking governor palin
9035642 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9035643 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9035644 we have only tested 11 of the 369 targets this year numerous quality targets remain to be tested and with our new targeting strategy we believe there is excellent opportunity to discover kimberlite on ualliq
9035645 the exploration and trial mining operations at kono project are progressing well and continue to deliver encouraging results
9035646 the first commercial tender of diamonds from the kono project is planned for august in johannesburg through existing petra marketing channels
9035647 as diamond production from the trial mining stopes increases over the coming months revenues from diamond sales are expected to generate regular cash flow to offset development expenditure
9035648 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9035649 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit cards bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach
9035650 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9035651 he re aggravated the injury in the tournament semi final versus the u s on august 22
9035652 an mri scan earlier this week confirmed he had re aggravated the injury and that there was no additional damage to the ankle or ligament
9035653 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9035654 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9035655 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9035656 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9035657 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9035658 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9035659 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9035660 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9035661 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9035662 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9035663 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9035664 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9035665 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9035666 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9035667 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9035668 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9035669 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9035670 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9035671 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

9035676 we are very pleased to report completion of this most recent tranche sale this sale continues to support our overall business strategy and market position
9035677 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9035678 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9035679 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9035680 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9035681 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9035682 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
9035683 i never thought id live to see the day that a man who looked like me would become the presidential nominee
9035684 this is one of the reasons im proud of this country as people from a vast array of ethnicities have put their prejudices and bias aside
9035685 tell that to the proud autoworkers at a michigan plant who after they found out it was closing kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever
9035686 the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
9035687 what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose and thats what we have to restore
9035688 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
9035689 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain sen obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way
9035690 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
9035691 subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
9035692 in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own
9035693 out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots

9035701 do you want this woman to be responsible for responding to the likes of vladamir putin
9035702 we just went out and kind of wanted to that last corners a bit funky
9035703 we got going pretty good on race tires and then came in and just put a new race tire on and went out and went a bit quicker so i mean it went good but nothing crazy special but track temp will be down tomorrow so times will probably be quicker yet again and well see if it holds up i doubt it i think itll be a little quicker tomorrow but that was it for today we tried as hard as we could and well see what happens tomorrow
9035704 if you put a lot more focus and effort and try to really think about this race too much youll probably go out and make a mistake if youre driving on pins and needles the whole 500 laps or 500 miles
9035705 so i think the biggest thing is just to go out and do what youve been doing and certainly maybe be a little extra cautious passing a lapped car on a restart or something like that but for the most part you just have to race and everything is gonna happen for a reason
9035706 if we dont make the chase its not gonna be because of these last two races
9035707 i can pick out five races from daytona to this point now that we didnt do some things right so these last two races arent gonna be the 100 percent reason if were in or if were out its gonna be a combination of a lot of things since daytona in february
9035708 i felt like i could go out and be superman and qualify on the pole and lead every lap and win the race and i hit realty pretty quick all of these guys are pretty good racers you can go out and practice and test and be as fast as you want but when you put yourself on a race track with 42 other drivers thats what makes it a little tougher than what it seems to be
9035709 you just have to go and do what youve been doing
9035710 if you drive yourself crazy trying not to make that mistake youre probably gonna slip up and make that mistake

9035726 its not just obama fans signing up to vote republican students like eliza drew are also getting registered
9035727 because now im registered to vote im officially a citizen i can have my impact on society i guess

9035734 as the chairman of seanergy i am very proud that as of today we will be an operating company in this attractive shipping sector our strategic vision is to position seanergy among the shipping industry leaders and generate shareholder value for the long term
9035735 the support by our sponsors to make our business combination happen has been unprecedented and indicates tangibly their belief in the positive fundamentals of the dry bulk sector and their faith in seanergys management to deliver shareholder value for the long term
9035736 seanergy commences its operations at a time when the dry bulk sector enjoys strong fundamentals with robust demand and attractive freight rates our strong cash flow generation due to the attractive charter rates we have secured for our initial fleet enables us to support a dividend payout of 64 of our distributable cash flow while retaining the rest for growth given our moderate leverage access to bank financing and expected capital inflow from the conversion of warrants we believe that seanergy is strategically positioned to take advantage of the positive market environment
9035737 why do christians say there is only one way to god
9035738 if i could answer all your questions to your satisfaction would you put your life in jesus hands
9035739 i guess a person could be sincere in what he or she believed but be sincerely wrong
9035740 i dont have answers to every question but if my conclusion about jesus is wrong i have a bigger problem what do i do with the evidence for his resurrection his deity and the prophecies he fulfilled and what do i do with changed lives including my own
9035741 causes all things to work together for good to those who love god
9035742 if you are worried about the people outside of faith in christ the most unreasonable thing you can do is to remain outside yourself
9035743 if christianity is a psychological crutch then jesus christ came because there was an epidemic of broken legs
9035744 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father but through me

9035746 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain

9035783 the present litigation is more complex than the misinformed and mischaracterized allegations of copyright infringement
9035784 the litigation involves the anti competitive nature of the apple eula and similar anti competitive tactics related to the misuse of apples copyrights issues related to the fair use of various by psystar also come into play
9035785 psystar alleges that there is no technical reason that a third party could not accumulate and assemble the hardware components in an apple labeled computer hardware system such that said system would be capable of running the mac os that is such that the system would constitute a mac os capable computer hardware system
9035786 on information and belief psystar alleges that but for the exclusionary conduct of apple and other conduct amounting to unfair competition as set forth in greater detail herein and as exemplified by the activities of psystar a third party could and would assemble the hardware components capable of running the mac os
9035787 that but for the anticompetitive conduct of apple as outlined herein apple labeled would otherwise be a competing member of the otherwise diverse mac oc market
9035788 any other operating system including but not limited to the lacks the potential or ability to deprive apple of its customers especially at a significant level of business as it concerns the mac os
9035789 we have seen increased interest in opencomputer with only a slight decrease in sales
9035790 we are allowing more people to take advantage of a great operating system that apple has created at a more accessible cost than the pricey mac

9035797 the op tempo is going going going we bring the veterans here because they have the knowledge of whats going on in theater we also try to give them time to decompress
9035798 it is inherently a physical exercise but its also intellectual
9035799 if you are in 80 pounds of kevlar and ceramic plates it will take its toll on you
9035800 its like a workout you are soaked in sweat and your ability to think and act is inhibited its something you have to work through the physical exhaustion and the heat
9035801 you drive past that wall run past it every day and its a reminder that i have to do my best every day to limit the number of names up there
9035802 we just have to batten down the hatches and see what happens
9035803 where we have our equipment seems to be ok for now
9035804 the good side of what happened in 2005 is theyre better prepared
9035805 i was struggling with that stroke but i managed to win at the end so that is the most important thing
9035806 i felt i had some chance but she had lots of heart
9035807 i played sometimes so well but then i made mistakes
9035808 i was not too bad i tried to go to the volley and put pressure on her but i felt my serve was not good i double faulted too much
9035809 i have no idea how she played what the other girl did i have no idea i only heard it on the news

9035813 may have triggered a public health catastrophe among the more than 300 000 people many of them children who lived in the fema homes
9035814 its important for people to know whats going on to make them see and listen to others who are critical of and opposed to the situation inside syria that will encourage them to break the silence
9035815 most people even from the opposition dont like the national salvation front because of its affiliation with khaddam a long term regime figure
9035816 most people dont know the names of the leaders of the damascus declaration they dont know the goals of this movement and they dont know what the opposition work on or do
9035817 its very dangerous right now and the authorities regard the national salvation front as a red line
9035818 the caucasus is the kind of place where when the guns start firing its hard to stop them that is the brutal reality of south ossetia
9035819 wrapped up in the dispute over russias attack on georgia is a moral argument between russia and the west that will shape the future of georgias breakaway territories
9035820 when i came i liked the language the culture the people
9035821 relations between the two peoples are not bad but if the political situation was better that would make the relationship easier
9035822 syria is probably the best place to study arabic and to learn the language and the culture in the environment
9035823 the knowledge that students are getting about syria by being in the country is about how good the falafel is about the lives of ordinary syrians and of course how to speak and read the language
9035824 i dont think theyre learning anything that would be new to the us government
9035825 i explain to my family and friends that syria is really the safest country i have ever visited its people are so friendly
9035826 but to be honest the relationship between syrians and americans usually is not deep at all westerners in syria between each other always criticise the country the habits the traditions the policy everything
9035827 we have good relations because we avoid discussing any serious subject with syrians
9035828 the caucasus is the kind of place where when the guns start firing its hard to stop them that is the brutal reality of south ossetia
9035829 wrapped up in the dispute over russias attack on georgia is a moral argument between russia and the west that will shape the future of georgias breakaway territories

9035835 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9035836 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
9035837 if this turns out to be a nonevent the market could really come roaring back down
9035838 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
9035839 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday
9035840 u s oil demand is currently 1 6 million barrels a day lower than when katrina struck
9035841 there is today more u s refining capacity offline for economic reasons than can be destroyed by gustav
9035842 however the analysis is still ongoing and no decisions have yet been made
9035843 its my belief given the improvement in the security situation in iraq that there will be a continued withdrawal of u s forces as promised by gen petraeus at his last congressional hearing later this fall
9035844 my sense is that i will be able to make a recommendation at that time for some further reductions
9035845 but i do believe there will be certain assets that as we are already looking at the picture right now well be able to recommend can be either redeployed or not deployed to the theater in the fall

9035867 shes a fairly articulate spokesperson for the pro drilling view that will provide an interesting contrast to the opposition
9035868 shes taken the ethical high ground and distanced herself from veco
9035869 she also has attempted to reverse the course established by the murkowski administration which was one where the administration directly negotiated with the oil industry in secret

9035873 the appeal of stone soup is that this deep area may collect and concentrate different kinds of materials
9035874 the trough between polygons is sort of a trap where things can accumulate
9035875 over a long timescale there may even be circulation of material sinking at the margins and rising at the center
9035876 we had a shootout between stone soup and white stuff in a trench called upper cupboard
9035877 if we had been able to confirm that the white material was a salt rich deposit we would have analyzed that but we were unable to confirm that with various methods
9035878 were headed to the next adventure out on the plains of meridiani

9035934 michelle obama said shes been in love with barack ever since he took her on their first date and bought her ice cream isnt that sweet yeah meanwhile john mccains wife cindy says shes been in love with mccain ever since he hit her over the head with a club and dragged her back to his cave
9035935 tomorrow this is a little fun fact for you both john mccain and michael jackson will celebrate their birthday yeah so it will be the birthday of an old white guy and john mccain
9035936 barack obamas freshly minted running mate sen joe biden also spoke tonight and i have to say after all the name related problems this campaign has had why obama would pick a vice president with the last name biden is beyond me not that theres anything wrong with the name of biden but obama biden its like theyre trying to make their ticket sound as much like osama bin laden as possible they found the two guys in america whose names match up most closely with the person we hate more than anyone in the world and they put them on the bumper stickers very good thinking
9035937 i dont think kobe is the best player im the best player theres a line that separates having confidence and being conceited i dont cross that line but i have a lot of confidence in myself

9035960 john mccains choice of sarah palin as his running mate proves just how rigid and extreme his administration would be when it comes to a womans right to choose
9035961 for 25 years mccain has opposed a womans right to choose and we know that he will continue to push anti choice policies in the white house mccains pick of anti choice sarah palin is further evidence that his white house will be just another four years of bush style policies any remaining doubts about mccains extreme anti choice position should be put to rest when voters learn about the combined anti choice records of sarah palin and john mccain
9035962 governors race top contenders meet one last time to debate
9035963 americans are tired of the kind of divisive anti choice policies that sen mccain and gov palin have pledged to continue to support the contrast between pro choice sen obama and anti choice sen mccain is clear voters are looking for a leader who respects womens freedom and privacy barack obama is that leader

9035966 systematically eliminating the root causes that drive women to abortion primarily lack of practical resources and support through holistic woman centered solutions
9035967 preconception issues including abstinence and contraception are outside of our mission
9035968 some ffl members and supporters support the use of non abortifacient contraception while others oppose contraception for a variety of reasons
9035969 sarah palin clearly addresses the issues so many conservatives are concerned about it balances out the ticket
9035970 shes also really a checkmate for the democratic party because folks who were looking to make history for barack obama can make history by voting for john mccain in seeing the first woman elected to the vice presidency it was a very strategic move by john mccain
9035971 sarah palin is the whole package there couldnt be a better vice presidential pick
9035972 by choosing the boldly pro life sarah palin as his running mate john mccain has taken his stand as the one true authentic pro life ticket

9036100 we have observed the excellent work of the label in the past few years napalm did see the writings on the wall and is one of the leading companies for example in online promotion and marketing they elevated older bands like atrocity to new heights and established newcomers like alestorm thus we are convinced that napalm will bring out the best in us and in return we will deliver a masterpiece of german true metal a storm is coming the sea is rough the coxswains are the veterans only the ship is new and manned by an excellent crew who know their craft
9036101 by far the bands most ambitious and dense material yet longer songs complex rythms and dynamic vocals fill out this 11 track monster
9036102 permission was not sought or granted nor would it have been given
9036103 only the size of a boxers heart wins on the canvas
9036104 he taught me to look forward and just learn from the negatives of the past
9036105 it would take too long to describe all the things i have changed
9036106 i have prepared very hard and very long i am in very good shape i want to win

9036110 politics is a lot about navigating conflict and there is just a thrill about it
9036111 the cool thing about doing it with school is that i can put what ive learned into practice
9036112 im going to meet so many people over the next two weeks
9036113 it costs just as much to grow a pretty apple as it does an ugly one
9036114 because of you our esteemed dignitaries festival sponsors and faithful attendees we are able to celebrate this wonderful mountain tradition
9036115 weve all had it so we dont know how to live without it
9036116 ulcerate is really looking forward to calling willowtip home a label weve respected for a long time and whose reputation for quality bands and quality service is something we really identify with its feels great to have their support and backing
9036117 and im just as new as you are i moved in just a week ago and im delighted to be here as the new chancellor of the university of wisconsin madison were starting together and you the class of 2012 are always going to be very special to me because we start this journey together
9036118 seventy eight percent of you said that you expect to have that same game point average at the end of your freshman year so i hope you get back to me about that
9036119 and learn to love what it feels like to produce them in your own mind think about intellectual achievement on the model of sports we are amazed and even awed by great olympic and big ten athletes and what they can do with their bodies
9036120 while youre here i want you also to learn the thrill of mental or intellectual athleticism as you witness it from others and experience it for yourselves push yourselves to see what your minds can actually do and exercise those minds often
9036121 for the most part when it comes to freshman convocation you need to get the big idea items out of the way
9036122 thats why i brought up safety as being one of the more important issues but pretty much i was just trying to give an introduction to madison life and campus life
9036123 strange scary and so unexpected second guessing yourself is second nature and its hard to break out of that box youre so comfortable in if you dont let madison into your heart if you dont let uw pump through your veins then you may just miss out on one of the best experiences you will ever have
9036124 it was worth it to get the idea about how the faculty feels about us coming in and getting a chance to see the new chancellor
9036125 it was also interesting to get an idea of the scope of what the class was like all of us in one place
9036126 but it was good to hear things reiterated ive met a lot of good people so far and im excited to get things going
9036127 certainly if you bought it two days ago there was no reason to hang around and speculate as to what happens over the weekend
9036128 after youve made the money on the upside you might as well sell and get out of it and you dont have to be involved

9036131 all the things people would look at no variables are supportive of sterling
9036132 especially when its pretty clear the white race is the most superior
9036133 you the class of 2012 will always be very special to me
9036134 what would you tell a new student about life at uw madison
9036135 id never heard of him but thats how it goes sometimes
9036136 the market is just very fragile theres not a lot of support going into the labor day weekend
9036137 the dell news has compounded the downside move when you have a non financial company missing its earnings thats disconcerting to the market
9036138 falta mucho camino por delante ahora el objetivo es calificar a la liguilla y ese ya ser un torneo aparte pero en este hay que tratar de seguir igual mantener el mismo nivel y seguir sumando
9036139 se ha tenido un buen nivel pero se puede tener uno mejor y eso puede ser con el transcurso del campeonato coment el habilidoso jugador del conjunto cruzazulino
9036140 s es algo en lo que se est trabajando tratar de mantener una ventaja primero y estar muy atentos atr s en algunos partidos ante guadalajara 2 2 y contra san luis 1 2 no nos ha alcanzado el tiempo y en la mayor a s hemos remontado
9036141 habla bien del equipo porque se ha tenido una buena reacci n se ha podido remontar o empatar y eso indica que el equipo est enchufado los 90 minutos
9036142 totalmente de acuerdo con ustedes que el equipo no consigue los resultados no tiene el funcionamiento que queremos estamos heridos pero no muertos
9036143 esto es un mensaje para el presidente porque en estos ltimos a os de mi carrera como t cnico he tenido cuatro y a los mismos los he hecho ganar t tulos y esta no ser la excepci n voy a poner todo mi empe o toda mi capacidad vamos a dar mucho m s porque sabemos que los jugadores tienen para hacerlo
9036144 ni los aficionados ni el presidente piensen que nos vamos a derrotar tan f cilmente al contrario vamos a seguir luchando trabajando intentando encontrar un equipo que tenga una contundencia y es lo que vamos a intentar hacer de aqu en adelante

9036152 si hubiera participado en los 400 metros con mi tiempo ganar a el oro
9036153 fue el resultado de una fuerte preparaci n y tuvieron su recompensa
9036154 no tengo cabeza para pensar en el futbol en este momento sino para pensar en la vida y seguridad de los jugadores
9036155 no s cuando vamos a volver a practicar la situaci n es ca tica
9036156 el cambio ha sido bastante no ha sido muy light como se dice venir a una instituci n como am rica son muchos factores que uno no los ten a considerados en otro club aqu tienes que ponerte a pensar las cosas entonces tanto en lo futbol stico como en lo extrafutbol stico voy por buen camino
9036157 no estamos en una crisis ni nada por el estilo el equipo est consciente que necesita un buen resultado tenemos que ganar todos los partidos pero tambi n todos los contrarios juegan diferente contra am rica hay que aceptarlo y jugar con ese plus porque a veces debes hacerlo contra equivocaciones de los rbitros

9036161 were pursuing the request for services for the project manager at this point
9036162 that includes putting together the rfs which weve been doing the last couple of weeks we had a building committee meeting in july and then again in august where we selected a subcommittee to do the bulk of the work on that weve been sharing the details of that with the sba and we should have the final document soon
9036163 the person either needs to be registered by the commonwealth as an architect or a professional engineer with at least five years experience in construction or supervision of construction specifically in school programs
9036164 in addition to all that theres an establishment of 11 criteria that were going to be using past performance is a big one familiarity with school guidelines is another experience with green building were going to be looking at personality all of that kind of stuff is going to be provided in the rfs part of what we did is to establish weight to each of these criteria so we can identify which is important
9036165 everybody thats looking into doing projects is going to look at those option in terms of potential savings
9036166 also it contributes to additional reimbursement points from the state if we make use of green building and that could cut the towns share by even more
9036167 we keep going as long as theres a commitment on the part of the two towns which was the first step in getting this feasibility study
9036168 when the study is done we will have schematic drawings with what it will look like that will be shown to people so they know what theyre getting that will be shown to the people at town meetings in both towns to approve the projects that will have to be presented to the sba

9036171 our hope is that by covering preventive services in full itll motivate our members to receive the preventive care they need to improve their chances for a healthy future
9036172 when it comes to protecting ones health few things are more important than staying up to date with routine preventive screenings
9036173 these tests can find serious diseases in the early stages when interventions are generally more effective and less expensive
9036174 the advent of modern drugs has led to demands for still less memory

9036177 we dont subscribe to a marketplace of ideas americans as a whole are more tough minded and more prepared for verbal combat
9036178 the articles tone was mocking and biting but it said nothing that conservative magazines and blogs in the united states do not say every day without fear of legal reprisal
9036179 i think it is a little silly that the nyts first source for saying that the us has gone too far in speech protection has spent most of his life outside the us
9036180 western governments are becoming increasingly comfortable with the regulation of opinion
9036181 the articles tone was mocking and biting but it said nothing that conservative magazines and blogs in the united states do not say every day without fear of legal reprisal
9036182 you cant draw a circle that small because of flux quantization
9036183 my ideal fantasy is to be running on a hot dusty road just wearing running shorts and some kind of top that wicks away sweat but in reality im running in 20 below temperatures so i wear layers of fleece and always a good outdoor waterproof trail shoe right now ive been running in nike air structure triax and i always wear sunglasses my kids tell me to put them on so i dont freak people out when they see me with a goofy hairdo and no makeup

9036189 todays budget vote was neither courageous nor productive it was more of the same from liberal politicians who would rather pick the pockets of hardworking families instead of cutting wasteful spending
9036190 assembly republicans commend our senate republican colleagues for defending hard working californians from billions in higher taxes and billions in new spending by standing united against the senate democrat budget
9036191 their irresponsible budget would have hurt working families by increasing the state sales tax threatened public safety byincluding a dangerous direct discharge parole scheme and done nothing to reform our broken budget system
9036192 now that the senate has joined the assembly in rejecting a budget proposal containing tax increases i hope we can finally get serious about working together to reach consensus on an honest budget compromise we must come together to craft a state budget that helps california live within its means improves our economy and protects californians from higher taxes
9036193 the stars tend to get all the credit but no team can accomplish important things without key contributions from role players players who are willing to put larger goals ahead of things like personal accomplishment or say self respect can you imagine how humiliating it must have been for swift who already had a reputation as a malingerer to miss games with back spasms and a sprained ankle and the flu he did it though and to heck with what people thought some people try to play through injuries swift courageously sat through his
9036194 jeff van gundy had him one year in houston 05 06 and concluded its been a career long quest to find a game and intensity level and focus so that the word potential is not always used in the sentence with him and he can reach some kind of consistency

9036240 another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in politics
9036241 put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9036242 why with so many other qualified women and men in his party did john mccain choose sarah palin
9036243 they both want to continue the failed economic policies of the bush administration and they both offer more of the same that has led this country down the wrong path
9036244 john mccain has made clear from the start that he wants to change washington and he proved it today by going as far away from washington as possible in selecting his running mate
9036245 he said that the mccain palin ticket is very strong he wished her good luck told her that she will be a fantastic vice presidential candidate and that he is looking forward to a great victory in november
9036246 shes not someone who has millions and millions of dollars
9036247 this is a tough smart person who can relate to the average joe
9036248 she is going to energize the republican party at that convention
9036249 shes new shes fresh theyre going to like her and theyre going to believe her
9036250 i think shes more representative of the future of the republican party
9036251 the first thing needed for innovation is a fascination with wonder
9036252 but we are taught instead to decide just as our president calls himself the decider
9036253 this breaks the major rule in the american belief system that anyone can do anything
9036254 thats a lie that we have perpetuated and it fosters mediocrity knowing what youre good at and doing even more of it creates excellence
9036255 i apprentice myself to someone when i want to learn something new or develop a new habit
9036256 other people read a book about it or take a course if you have a pathway to learning use it because thats going to be easier than creating an entirely new pathway in your brain
9036257 it helps keep your brain healthy it turns out that unless we continue to learn new things which challenges our brains to create new pathways they literally begin to atrophy which may result in alzheimers and other brain diseases continuously stretching ourselves will even help us lose weight according to one study researchers who asked folks to do something different every day listen to a new radio station for instance found that they lost and kept off weight no one is sure why but scientists speculate that getting out of routines makes us more aware in general
9036258 whenever we initiate change even a positive one we activate fear in our emotional brain
9036259 if the fear is big enough the fight or flight response will go off and well run from what were trying to do the small steps in kaizen dont set off fight or flight but rather keep us in the thinking brain where we have access to our creativity and playfulness
9036260 you habitually do it one way now try doing it with the other thumb on top feels awkward doesnt it thats the valuable moment we call confusion when we fuse the old with the new
9036261 you get convergence and we keep doing the same thing over and over again

9036346 even during the cold war regardless of political or other circumstances the soviet union always promptly met its contractual obligations to deliver energy to europe and russia being a responsible and reliable partner will also uphold such principles
9036347 made the international situation much more tense the direct consequence being a forceful strengthening of natos military and political position and all that will be happening close to our borders
9036348 i think we will shortly be witness to a dramatic change of the east west policies

9036370 as an industry we need to begin setting some basic common sense standards that reward pc gamers for purchasing our games
9036371 the console market effectively already has something like this in that its games have to go through the platform maker such as nintendo microsoft or sony but on the pc publishers can release games that are scarcely completed poorly supported and full of intrusive copy protection and then be stuck on it
9036372 this is an awesome framework for the industry to aspire to and ultimately so that we can provide our customers with the gaming experience that they have wanted for years and really deserve
9036373 the pc market loses out on a lot of sales because a significant percentage of our market has pcs that may or may not be adequate to run our games without the ability to return games to the publisher for a refund many potential buyers simply pass on games they might otherwise have bought due to the risk of not being certain a game will work on their pc the average consumer doesnt know what pixel shader 2 0 support means for instance
9036374 but its not really a risk inherent in the single parent family per se you cant assume that every child raised by a single parent is going to have difficulties the majority dont
9036375 their concerns were driven by a lot of cultural assumptions which led them to propose kids are better off in the traditional family

9036389 the volcanic plumes get most of the attention but there are probably also things like fumeroles and geysers on a previous flyby the particles and fields instruments saw a deficit of energetic particles over io where gas was probably coming out of the surface but no plumes were seen we call this the stealth plume hypothesis the closest earthly analog to whats happening would be a water geyser like old faithful in fact if you put old faithful on io it would be about 37 km high
9036390 the cloud of volcanic debris which extends 330 kilometers 200 miles above the moons surface only the upper part of the plume is visible from this vantage point the plumes source is 130 kilometers 80 miles below the edge of ios disk on the far side of the moon
9036391 ios surface is dotted with volcanic depressions known as paterae paterae generally have flat floors bounded by steep walls these features resemble terrestrial calderas but it is unknown if they are produced through collapse over an emptied lava chamber as with their terrestrial cousins one hypothesis suggests that these features are produced through the exhumation of volcanic sills with the overlying material either being blasted out or integrated into the sill unlike similar features on earth and mars these depressions generally do not lie at the peak of shield volcanoes and are normally larger with an average diameter of 41 km 25 mi the largest being loki patera at 202 km 125 mi

9036468 this new finding may help to explain why the clock is so far reaching in its effects on the organism
9036469 we found that some 25 percent of the genes in our model organism appear to be under clock control i wasnt suspecting anything remotely like that
9036470 it appears the clock influences a number of biological processes including cell cycling protein metabolism and varied signaling processes
9036471 but perhaps the most important role weve seen so far is the clocks role in ribosome biogenesis
9036472 the resulting molecular mechanism or genetic network for the clock identified by this mode guided discovery process will have a broad appeal to geneticists physiologists and those with an interest in signaling pathways
9036473 the methods used to characterize what makes a biological clock tick will have numerous applications in finding genetic networks describing other complex traits in many biological systems
9036474 we found that if e2f3a is present the animals can develop normally through adulthood even when all the other genes are absent
9036475 if the e2f3a gene was doing something unique replacing it with one of the others should prevent development
9036476 we conclude from this that it is the genes location in the genome plus the timing and level of its activity that makes it so important during development
9036477 organisms above insects have multiple e2fs and these findings dont tell us what the others are doing
9036478 we surmise that the other genes are required for adult survival under the stressful conditions in the wild we are investigating that now
9036479 we want to know how the brain areas that encode memory are organized
9036480 if your memory is affected by aging or alzheimers disease is there a way to learn that can capitalize on the brain structures that may still be working well
9036481 because of the large deformation signals from the dike intrusion we needed to do some detailed detective work to prove the existence of this slow earthquake
9036482 we used state of the art insar satellite data to constrain the dike source and that allowed us to demonstrate the existence of the slow earthquake motions recorded by the gps stations on kilaueas flank
9036483 a dike intrusion could be seen with the seismic monitoring network the tiltmeters and the gps network but these slow earthquakes can only be seen with the gps network
9036484 these slow earthquakes are an interesting phenomenon that has only been studied within the last decade and were still trying to figure out how they fall into the bigger picture of earthquakes says cecily wolfe also an associate professor in higp and another co author
9036485 theyre definitely a part of the earthquakes cycle and trying to understand how they relate to other earthquakes and how they may be generated and triggered will give us greater insights into how predicable
9036486 this is the largest investigation to date to compare fracture rates in hiv infected patients with those of non infected controls
9036487 this very large study group with more than 8 500 hiv infected patients and over two million controls has the power to detect significant differences in risk for both men and women at critical sites such as the hip and spine risks that increased with age
9036488 these data indicate that we should screen hiv infected patients both men and women for low bone density as they age
9036489 we also need to learn more about the mechanisms of this bone loss whether antiviral drugs the virus itself or other metabolic factors are responsible and investigate specific fracture rates for women before and after menopause

9036491 as they capture mosquitoes that have had a blood meal and thus more opportunity to become infected
9036492 each female mosquito has the potential to produce about 200 eggs and she can have as many as five cycles so when we capture a gravid mosquito that can remove as many as 500 females
9036493 sampling the species in urban environments has been a challenge until studies on its oviposition cues allowed the development of gravid female traps that collect mostly females that previously have blood fed and therefore had a chance to become infected

9036578 for a while they all talk the talk and nothing happens then in the last four or five days every half an hour there is a headline saying someone has signed somewhere
9036579 when you have experience of transfer dealings you know that as long as something is not signed you know it can change very quickly so you can look very silly so you dont want to come out and announce it
9036580 i wanted you to confide in me but i wasnt willing to make the same effort
9036581 quando riapri gli occhi dopo aver sognato ricorda il tuo sogno nel tempo potresti scoprire che nn stato un caso
9036582 quando i sogni diventano numerosi e lontani da un qualcosa che pu essere collegato allinconscio o alla vita reale preferisco ricordarli poich nulla viene a caso tutto un percorso e voglio accogliere ci che nella notte invade il mio sonno e farne tesoro e chiss che come in un puzzle i tasselli svelino limmagine che cerco
9036583 i know my transgressions and my sin is always before me
9036584 therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed

9036654 isenhour 40 created a national controversy when while filming an instructional video dec 12 at grand cypress resort in orlando he attempted to quiet the noisy hawk by hitting golf balls with a 7 iron at the tree in which the bird was roosting about 50 or 60 yards from the set on about the sixth shot isenhour hit the hawk and killed it
9036655 im not denying that the bird accidentally was killed by the golf ball and were not denying it was wrong
9036656 i did something wrong and i have to take ownership of that
9036657 it was one thing if he hit a couple of balls but two elements give it away
9036658 the first is that he was unsuccessful the first time and did it again
9036659 isenhour and other members of the crew did contact the local audubon society to inform officials about the accident and were told that if the hawk was not breathing to then bury it
9036660 he wasnt angry he didnt come off to me as being angry at all
9036661 he was just like trying to scare it away he wasnt like you know seriously like trying to like hit the bird or do anything like that he definitely wasnt trying to kill the bird
9036662 the part that bothers me the most in all this is the conduct of the officer
9036663 he shouldnt be in a position of authority if you abuse that authority
9036664 i look at things in perfunctory way i have no vested interest
9036665 to go through what i went through in march when the charges were filed with the media circus and everything i went through i didnt want to put my family through all that the fact is im not denying the accident occurred but it would be very hard for a jury even though the circumstances are much different than what was reported it would be very difficult for them to find me not guilty given the way the law is written

9036687 mahkamah konstitusi mk telah membatalkan pasal 28 ayat 2 undang undang uu nomor 22 tahun 2001 tentang minyak dan gas yang menyebutkan harga bahan bakar minyak bbm dan gas diserahkan pada mekanisme pasar
9036688 pihak pertamina tidak berhak menetapkan harga eceran gas elpiji dan penetapan harga menjadi kewenangan pemerintah dan pemerintah telah kecolongan dengan membiarkan pertamina menaikan harga gas elpiji secara beruntun selang waktu dua bulan yang menyengsarakan rakyat
9036689 pemerintah terkesan tidak obyektif melihat persoalan cendrung berpihak kepada pertaminan dan membiarkan rakyatnya menjerit akibat kenaikan harga gas elpiji
9036690 keputusan menaikan harga elpiji hanya solusi yang menguntungkan pertamina sementara masyarakat semakin terjepit dan memperpanjang mata rantai carut marutnya tataniaga gas karena berakibat semakin langkanya persediaan elpiji di pasaran
9036691 saya rasa gas elpiji kemasan 3 kg juga akan mengalami kelangkaan karena diburu konsumen pasca kenaikkan harga gas elpiji 12 kg
9036692 konversi minyak tanah ke gas sulit terwujud sebab persediaan gas semakin langka pasca kenaikkan harga gas elpiji kemasan 12 kg dan 50 kg
9036693 a lot of things that happened during katrina were beyond our control but after the storm we did some things to make sure wed be ready the next time
9036694 our first step was to gather contact information from our employees as to how and where they can be reached once they evacuate
9036695 we started preparing the building for a hurricane moving things off the floor taking important records from the first to the second floor and making sure anything outside that can be secured is secured
9036696 after katrina came we had two publications at the printer they were printing them and wanted to be paid for them but our advertisers werent going to pay us for magazines that couldnt go anywhere
9036697 i dont want 50 000 copies of something thats going to have to sit
9036698 we want to make sure we have the distribution channels to get them out
9036699 we found it very difficult to communicate with our staff after katrina because cell phones with the 504 area code didnt work very well
9036700 we had people out there and we couldnt find them
9036701 we went ahead and did a one week payroll so we could get money into peoples hands in case they need it we just tried to think of everything
9036702 all of our circulation subscription and advertising lists now are stored at an offsite data center by a company that has dual backup in other markets
9036703 that has helped tremendously now we dont have to worry about a flood ruining our servers and wiping everything out

9036725 this makes a lot of sense that we should have a standard accounting language across the world when you look at a set of financial statements it ought to be readable by someone in china and london
9036726 here in columbus ohio were going to have our bankers the people who run our pension funds and others who use financial statements in a daily part of their work theyre going to have to be able to understand ifrs
9036727 there may not be a lot of companies that want to be pioneers in this but there could be some advantages
9036728 strategically even though we may not technically be required as an organization it will behoove us to move in that direction

9036746 we should do the dems one better well get a chick but not just any chick well get a hot chick well get a milf
9036747 well get mccain to pick the woman named the hottest governor wonkette even has an acronym for her shes a gilf
9036748 but wait isnt the idea of this game to pick someone bad so far everything youve said is good shes a woman and therefore we might get the hillary supporters back and shes hot so that might help us get the horny vote but wheres the downside

9036753 axl rose didnt call the fbi but today it became more than obvious that someone really was serious about that threat johnny and i sat on a pew in the u s district court building in downtown l a as skwerl sat behind glass in handcuffs and still in his jammies since the fbi arrested him at 6 59 this morning after five or so other cases were presented the united states of america presented her case against skwerl the proceeding was mostly about what his bail was going to be set at the u s a requested bail be set at 50 000 skwerls court appointed attorney thankfully called b s on that one and recommended his bail be 5 000 and that this case is the kind of case where the defendant should have been summoned to appear instead of being accosted by five f b i agents at his home in a quiet neighborhood interestingly the judge chimed in to add that he had actually recommended that it be a summons case and wasnt sure why it went down as it did he also dismissed the idea presented by the u s a that squirrels be forbidden to use the internet in the end the judge ruled that his bail be in the form of a signature bond at 10 000 what that means is that skwerl has to remain within the central district of california until his next court date or someone has to cough up that 10k so for now hes home stay tuned moving forward a preliminary hearing has been scheduled for september 17th at 4 30 pm and the arraignment for september 22nd at 8 30 am both will be at the u s district court building and the address is 255 east temple street third floor in downtown los angeles skwerl johnny and i appreciate your concern and warm wishes during these hard times as we deal with democracy
9036754 while conditions in the financial sector have been challenging we believe bankatlantic bancorps stock price has been unfairly depressed largely due to misinformation provided to the market

9036756 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9036757 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
9036758 if this turns out to be a nonevent the market could really come roaring back down
9036759 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
9036760 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday
9036761 u s oil demand is currently 1 6 million barrels a day lower than when katrina struck
9036762 there is today more u s refining capacity offline for economic reasons than can be destroyed by gustav
9036763 as a tourism community at this point we are operating business as usual
9036764 in a very sort of counterintuitive way it was a net benefit for the hotels in the area because of storm displacement and temporary housing
9036765 its not the way you want to boost your business but unfortunately its the reality
9036766 when we see something like this happen earlier in the week people will tend to look at other places other destinations that arent going to be affected
9036767 given the flight cutbacks and high load factors you may have a heck of a tough time finding a substitute trip that quickly
9036768 its become the norm that were always looking at potential events or significant weather coming through
9036769 its just become a way of life for us to have the ability to react to situations like this
9036770 with a sunny and clear forecast for the weekend we hope to have a normal labor day as people arrive on friday evening stay through the weekend and depart on monday morning
9036771 we came away impressed with the new ceo and his resolve to repair the damage at wachovia
9036772 it appears chicken is still being used as a political tool
9036773 but theyre still the most significant and if they quit buying that would certainly dull that bright spot
9036774 we are doing more business in places such as china africa and the middle east
9036775 we have over 100 export markets so its not going to have a dramatic effect
9036776 of course we like to avoid any such situations but weve learned to deal with it through the years
9036777 i never even gave any thought to it being awkward
9036778 i dont find any of this surprising given the actions of the past three weeks
9036779 south ossetia and abkhazia are a part of georgia under un recognized laws in fact laws and security council resolutions that russia itself has supported
9036780 and before august 6th you did not have russian bases on that territory
9036781 we continue to be dismayed that russia has not fulfilled all of its requirements in the peace agreement

9036865 bangladesh may now be among the worlds most dangerous countries for journalists that makes mr choudhurys courageous stand for muslim jewish dialogue all the more admirable and vital to defend
9036866 the united states must encourage people like mr choudhury to speak out but when they do it also should do all it can to protect them freeing mr choudhury will tell others like him that when you stand against islamists the united states will stand with you
9036867 mr choudhury is a man in the mold of such heroes of freedom as vaclav havel and lech walesa
9036868 would choudhury consider it if along with this acknowledgement the request also nevertheless came to give up his fight and to free the family from their state of siege the family would have enough money to lead a calm life abroad and they would have a good chance of leaving bangladesh despite the current legal proceedings but for choudhury his struggle has long ago become his who leaves the battleground has lost he says however whoever struggles for the right cause always wins
9036869 this is why we ought to be taking notice of choudhury its not just a question of saving one mans life he is part of a threat that is facing all of us and he is on the right side in a very long battle of ideas
9036870 now that weve found a man willing to advocate for peace and denouncing extremism we must seize the opportunity no one else will speak out if we allow those who already have spoken to die
9036871 in this tense atmosphere choudhury has paid a very heavy price for his beliefs in november 2003 he was arrested at dhakas international airport just prior to boarding a flight on his way to israel where he has been scheduled to deliver an address on promoting understanding between muslims and jews
9036872 shoaib in an outspoken supporter of muslim jewish and muslim christian dialogue opposes anti israel
9036873 they are neither they work alone with no support forging ahead to bring the truth into open the international press freedom awards that recognizes courage in journalism is an important event that brings the plight of these journalists to light but its not enough they deserve encouragement and support because in dangerous situations they champion everything we hold dear and often take for granted

9036889 well it was a bit of a flop olini to tell you the truth
9036890 six months from now were all going to remember the event we will not i think remember what he said
9036891 im actually putting a little edge on my criticism just to make up for the fact that on msnbc last night somebody said quote it wasnt a speech it was a symphony i wont even name who said it im here to balance that bit of fatuous suck upping
9036892 my way of saying it would be that was not a sissy speech okay it wasnt that kind of usual uhhh the poor child born with two heads and no medical insurance and theyre using him as a bowling ball you know the terrible things they say
9036893 everybody is sick in their world im sorry everybody is an unhappy unwed single mother whose feet are exploding and they dont exactly see the bright side of america guys
9036894 if you want to claim yourself as a responsible journalist and not an agent of us israel government as you mentioned to check to accommodate us please stop such propaganda against bangladesh also any individual please do not use any abusive word like nasty everybody knows to use slang but i never like to do so to a woman
9036895 yes i said the information you used were very old and made story based on this report with an intension to defame bangladesh and the government please oil your own machine may i assign you to make an in depth report on what the indian and us government is doing to repress newsmen
9036896 may i ask you to report on israels continuous attack on palestine may i ask you who assigned you to defend some bangladeshi journalists what you have done to defend journalists in india or your master us and israel please check their state how they are passing their time
9036897 please do something for betterment of humankind as a journalist you have some responsibility instead of trying to be agent of us and its collaborators in middle east you know israel is trying to occupy palestine with the help of its master us you better know what us done with iraq and what it is doing with iran and syria
9036898 unfortunately you are not aware of many things who salauddin shoeb chowdhury is for your information shoeb chowdhury a former employee of itar tass news agency of former soviet union joined the daily inqilab a local vernacular newspaper which is known as the patron of islamic fundamentalists and militants in bangladesh chowdhury worked there several years he also wrote a lot of articles in the new nation and the daily inqilab praising the talebans and islamic militants he also wrote many articles against americans and also jews
9036899 interestingly one day we saw a news item in the daily inqilab that chowdhury was suspended from job for misappropriating funds for establishing a tv channel by the inqilab authorities losing job in the inqilab he suddenly became desperate and was trying to get blessings from somewhere else which would make him solvent financially
9036900 yes it is true that he has the capability of writing using this skill he wrote an article in favour of jews which was quite surprising and did not match his past records and political ideology because he had already proved himself as a patron of islamic forces anyone can find this truth if he she feels the necessity to investigate about it coming to bangladesh
9036901 bangladesh may now be among the worlds most dangerous countries for journalists that makes mr choudhurys courageous stand for muslim jewish dialogue all the more admirable and vital to defend
9036902 the united states must encourage people like mr choudhury to speak out but when they do it also should do all it can to protect them freeing mr choudhury will tell others like him that when you stand against islamists the united states will stand with you
9036903 mr choudhury is a man in the mold of such heroes of freedom as vaclav havel and lech walesa

9036905 this is why we ought to be taking notice of choudhury its not just a question of saving one mans life he is part of a threat that is facing all of us and he is on the right side in a very long battle of ideas
9036906 now that weve found a man willing to advocate for peace and denouncing extremism we must seize the opportunity no one else will speak out if we allow those who already have spoken to die
9036907 in this tense atmosphere choudhury has paid a very heavy price for his beliefs in november 2003 he was arrested at dhakas international airport just prior to boarding a flight on his way to israel where he has been scheduled to deliver an address on promoting understanding between muslims and jews
9036908 shoaib in an outspoken supporter of muslim jewish and muslim christian dialogue opposes anti israel
9036909 they are neither they work alone with no support forging ahead to bring the truth into open the international press freedom awards that recognizes courage in journalism is an important event that brings the plight of these journalists to light but its not enough they deserve encouragement and support because in dangerous situations they champion everything we hold dear and often take for granted
9036910 and as far as i know soheb choudhury was arrested for violation of our passport laws
9036911 i will tell the government that the united states believes credible elections would be extremely difficult under a state of emergency and it should be lifted
9036912 my hope is that those elections will result in a more stable and deeply rooted democracy
9036913 this is a critical time for bangladesh a country in transition in a region of the world vital to us interests
9036914 we look to increased partnership as bangladesh takes its rightful place as a country that can help to bring stability and strength to south asia
9036915 promoting democracy ensuring development and denying space to terrorism are the key challenges bangladesh faces and are vital to the future of the relationship between our countries
9036916 much has been accomplished in a short period of time but with less than eight months remaining of this governments tenure there is much work that remains to be done
9036917 the biggest problems here in regard to terrorism are lack of good governance and lack of prosperity
9036918 the human rights report from last year was not a good one
9036919 bangladesh shows over reaction on minor causes turns sensitive whereas it does not show reaction where required when american newspaper wall street journal write bangladesh broken then it government remains silent did not even send a protest note but always jumps when diplomats say anything this is nothing new that diplomat said this afresh diplomats expressed their thoughts on democratic government military regime or even emergency government sometime it went in favor of bangladesh sometime against let us take the case of one eleven diplomats were vocal in pre 1 11 time their initiatives were open they spoke at home and abroad we all too appreciate in unison could a single individual be located who did not support 1 11 politicians who are in jail on various allegations even went to bangabhaban presidential palace to express their support

9036924 a woman cannot enjoy rights equal to a mans because a woman is not equal to a man by birth can there be two prime ministers one male and one female in a country at the same time
9036925 this policy has strongly hurt the pious muslims of the country since many sections of it clash with the koran and sunnah it does not go with bangladeshs constitution religious traditions and culture
9036926 existing disparities between women and men in light of the koran and the sunnah
9036927 must be given equal opportunities and participation in wealth employment market and business
9036928 it was a pathetic sight it was a despicable display of use of a religious and venerated place by the so called protagonists of islam to vent their anger at the government what we witnessed last friday inexplicable acts of violence and vandalism by people believing that whatever they were doing was to safeguard the interest of islam their protest was against what they believed to be certain provisions of the recently declared womens policy being inconsistent with the provisions of islam related to the issue what they failed to realize was that their violent behavior was itself inconsistent with the teachings of the religion whose interest they were claiming to protect little did they realize that their vandalism had done little to enhance the image of islam if anything their actions beamed worldwide on the electronic media have helped reinforce the misperception of those that are disposed to see islam as an intemperate religion where violence happens to be the only expression of dissent and no room is ever given to those perceived as opposed to their views mosques become bastions of protests a result of malicious thoughts demonstrated through depraved actions their actions have served islam very badly and must have made those that are prone to paint bangladesh as a country going down the road to radicalism very happy indeed ignorance and wrong political motivation have much to do with all that transpired on the friday afternoon which witnessed pitched confrontation against the law enforcing agency directed by alleged supporters of some islamic parties although i am loathe to believe that those we saw on the street wielding bamboo staffs and throwing brickbats at the police are actually what they claim to be and i am even less convinced that the party that they claim to belong to really believes in the tenets of islam and the teachings of the holy prophet one is at a loss to reason what their protest was about if it was against the said policy which its opponents believe proposed equal share in the inheritance rights of both men and women then there is enough ground to believe that it is either ignorance or some other ulterior motives that have motivated these people to resort to violence on both counts there are reasons to be concerned there is nothing worse than actions particularly destructive ones initiated on the basis of wrong premise or ignorance of facts the situation is more compounded when the issue is one that has to do with the deep seated belief and practice of the majority people of the country if there are other compulsions stemming from ulterior motives that led to them resorting to the hostile acts merely legal actions against the perpetrators of the violence is not enough what is it that they want to achieve and what is the benefit that they would want to derive from an already unstable situation caused by a degree of political uncertainty and spiraling prices in the country but if these radical elements are responsible for the violence that we saw the government must also shoulder its share of responsibility for allowing the situation to develop in the way it has in the first place and then to see it pass last friday since the policy was declared a policy that is not this governments brainchild but an inheritance from the past regimes expressions of dissent were heard from the religious parties in the country and to my mind these were based on misperception of the provisions that they believed were in contravention of certain islamic decrees and in this regard i have no reason not to take the advisor for religious affairs at her words when she said in unequivocal terms that the proposed policy does not have anything that is anti shariah and it is only a policy and not a proposed ordinance however one must admit that reports appearing in certain newspapers the day after the announcement regarding the proposed policy was made did convey the impression that there were indeed certain provisions that were inconsistent with the existing islamic law but that was clarified subsequently by the relevant advisor and that is what begs the question why did the government fail to convince those that were apprehensive about the proposed policy and why is it that it did not take adequate measures to dissuade or prevent these parties from taking precipitate action that they were threatening they would take following the announcement of the proposed policy the handling of two matters has raised questions about the government capability to address serious issues the undue haste with which the government constituted a committee formed of religious scholars gave one the impression that it was not sure about the substance of the policy that it did not anticipate the reactions that it might generate suggests that adequate time was not given to study the issue one wonders whether it was for this government to announce a policy that required to be studied in details before it was finally formulated and if inputs of the alems are being sought now why were they not sought during its formulation and before it was announced its handling of the religious parties has raised the question whether the government is not too soft on them while holding of public demonstration under the epr is prohibited these parties seem to do it without any hindrance not only in the recent instance on a few previous occasions too demonstrations organized by some religious parties were allowed to traverse many kilometers of the road despite police presence one would like to ask why these elements were allowed to stage demonstrations last friday outside bait ul mukarram in the first place and it is from these demonstrators that the attack on the police was launched initially before the mayhem started lasting almost 3 hours there may be genuine reservations about the policy and many that have doubts about it are not all radicals if there are suspicions about the provisions than there is a more islamic way a more civilized way of addressing it and that is through dialogue and the government must initiate a discussion on the issue without delay or make public the proposed policy in its entirety but for the government it is important too to remove the public perception about its being tough on some political parties while softening its attitude towards others
9036929 the women development policy is a significant step by the current government for establishing equal rights and respect for women but the fundamentalists and war criminals in the country are opposing the policy terming it an anti islam policy
9036930 when the entire nation is vocal about trial of war criminals a certain quarter is trying to create anarchy in the country in the name of religion
9036931 the so called islamic scholars backed by war criminals dishonored the national mosque while staging protest against the women development policy
9036932 the intimidation of the minorities which had begun before the election became worse afterwards
9036933 president bush and america is the most heinous terrorist in the world both america and bush must be destroyed the americans will be washed away if bangladeshs 120 million muslims spit on them
9036934 once the students graduate from the madrassas they either join mosques as imams or similar religious related jobs there are hundreds of thousands of mosques so there is employment in that field but they find it difficult to get employment in secular institutions certain quarters grab this opportunity to brainwash them make them into religious fanatics rather than modern muslims
9036935 there are areas in all parts of the world where strong jihadist forces are present from indonesia to algeria from kabul to chechnya from bosnia to sudan and from myanmar to kashmir
9036936 because bangladesh is seen as this development success story its fallen under the radar
9036937 theres too much at stake here until now we could say this is a really good example of islam and democracy coexisting
9036938 theyve received monetary help from saudi arabia south africa pakistan
9036939 the rise of islamist parties creates a permissive environment making it difficult to crackdown on militants when the people in power are aligned with islamist politics
9036940 the number is very low its not proof that jamaat e islami was involved in terrorist activities
9036941 they are an economy within the economy a state within a state
9036942 democracy has gone far downhill since it came in 1991
9036943 bangladesh is really not a democracy because the government which is elected freely and fairly cannot govern and that applies to both parties
9036944 although we have reduced poverty over the last few years by about a percentage a year inequality is still increasing
9036945 consensus is a must for the people to come together as a bulwark against this that is the need of the hour
9036946 i fear that bangladesh might revert to its pre 1991 condition in which even the peaceful transfer of power after credible elections was not possible
9036947 this impasse has serious implications not only for bangladesh but also for the south asian region and the islamic world
9036948 change the geopolitics of our engagement with islam and our efforts in countering terrorism
9036949 because minorities especially hindus were subjected to intimidation and other forms of pressure during previous election campaigns the united states has increased its monitoring of this issue in anticipation of the 2007 election
9036950 bangladesh lost her secular image after amendments to the constitution in 1977 and 1988 bangladesh was a secular democratic state a state which makes no difference between a citizen and a citizen which deals fairly with all irrespective of caste creed or community in the constitution of bangladesh 1972 but the elections in bangladesh since 1979 have become a tussle between army owned political parties versus peoples political organizations
9036951 there is a difference between international terrors and local goons

9036953 despite a host of newspapers reports the government apparently cloaked all terrorism episodes in mysterious silence
9036954 in the present debate over terrorism threats bangladesh is generally not the first country that comes to mind as a hotspot of al qaida activity
9036955 is bangladesh emerging as a new staging ground for the al qaida
9036956 southern bangladesh has become a haven for hundreds of jihadis on the lam
9036957 fighters trained and given new identities regularly find their way to conflicts in afghanistan and kashmir
9036958 has been involved in scores of bombings including two attempted assassinations of the then prime minister sheikh hasina
9036959 in the past bangladesh has been hit by a series of bombings the worst were in august 2005 when hundreds of bombs were simultaneously exploded across the country security forces have uncovered large caches of weapons and explosives suggesting that these groups have well established links with outside organizations a former commander of a training camp inside the country who did not want to be identified told us that he has intimate knowledge of the international links bangladeshi groups have with outside organizations including al qaida he told us that 3 000 afghan veterans are in bangladesh that rebel leaders met osama bin laden in afghanistan in 1998 and with his support they set up a branch of al qaida in bangladesh experts say the groups have infiltrated every sector of the bangladesh economy
9036960 professor abdul barkat a bangladeshi economist says the money comes not only from the middle east but also from second or third generation muslims in the west who do not realize that their donations will end up in the madrassas religious school system
9036961 they want to destroy the madrassas education system as it is gaining in popularity and people are coming towards islam
9036962 so they want to destroy the madrassas by linking them with terrorism but the reality is the madrassas is not linked with militancy
9036963 there is no suggestion that mufti aminis madrassas has any links with so called terrorist groups
9036964 while the united states dithers a growing islamic fundamentalist movement linked to al qaida and pakistani intelligence agencies is steadily converting the strategically located nation of bangladesh into a new regional hub for terrorist operations that reach into india and southeast asia
9036965 have connections with groups in nepal and bangladesh which are directly or indirectly connected to pakistan
9036966 we are alarmed by the growing pattern of intimidation of journalists by islamic groups in bangladesh
9036967 as a result of its alliance with the jamaat islamiyah the government appears to lack the ability or will to protect journalists from this new and grave threat
9036968 in many ways bangladesh seems an excellent place for al qaeda to find sanctuary in the decisive years ahead

9037024 and there came one of the seven angels saying unto me come hither i will show unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters 2 with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication 3 so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns 4 and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication 5 and upon her forehead was a name written mystery babylon the great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth 6 and i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of jesus and when i saw her i wondered with great admiration 7 and the angel said unto me wherefore didst thou marvel i will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carrieth her which hath the seven heads and ten horns 8 the beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the beast that was and is not and yet is 9 and here is the mind which hath wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth 10 and there are seven kings five are fallen and one is and the other is not yet come and when he cometh he must continue a short space 11 and the beast that was and is not even he is the eighth and is of the seven and goeth into perdition 12 and the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings which have received no kingdom as yet but receive power as kings one hour with the beast 13 these have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the beast 14 these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful 15 and he saith unto me the waters which thou sawest where the whore sitteth are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues 16 and the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast these shall hate the whore and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire 17 for god hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will and to agree and give their kingdom unto the beast until the words of god shall be fulfilled 18 and the woman which thou sawest is that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth
9037025 and there are seven kings five are fallen and one is and the other is not yet come and when he cometh he must continue a short space and the beast that was and is not even he is the eighth and is of the seven and goeth into perdition
9037026 and the woman church fled into the wilderness where she hath a place prepared of god that they should feed her there a thousand and two hundred and threescore days
9037027 and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place where she is nourished for a time times and half a time from the face of the serpent
9037028 and there are seven kings five are fallen and one is and the other is not yet come and when he cometh he must continue a short space

9037030 the beast that thou sawest was the catholic church was once a beast until 1798 and is not during her wilderness experience and shall ascend after the fall of benedict xvi the eighth will restore her beast status out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition

9037032 and the beast that was and is not even he is the eighth and is of the seven and goeth into perdition
9037033 and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beast

9037041 and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet for they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of god almighty
9037042 behold the days come saith the lord god that i will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the lord and they shall wander from sea to sea and from the north even to the east they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the lord and shall not find it
9037043 the beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the beast that was and is not and yet is
9037044 to the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light in them

9037046 did jesus make this sacrifice for me did he endure humiliation shame and reproach and suffer the cruel death of the cross because he desired to save me from the sufferings of guilt and the horror of despair and make me unspeakably happy in his kingdom
9037047 the lord shall have the service of my life i will no longer unite with his enemies i will no longer lend my influence to the rebels against his government all i have and am is too little to devote to him who so loved me that he gave his life for me his whole divine self for one so sinful and erring

9037070 after trying to make experience the issue of this campaign john mccain celebrated his 72nd birthday by appointing a former small town mayor and brand new governor as his vice presidential nominee is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgement it shows political panic

9037140 without natural predators the beavers have proliferated to a population now estimated at 200 000 naturally herbivorous they have taken to eating fish increasing in size and creating dams 100 metres in length
9037141 canadian beavers are now rampaging across the boreal forest into russia and displacing their european brethren
9037142 they were introduced in 1665 by king charles ii who released them into beautiful st jamess park in london
9037143 i was studying near an english castle last year and the moat was full of smelly messy canada geese who would honk so loudly it was sometimes difficult to hear the teachers
9037144 i lived in new zealand a country plagued with introduced species for a time and when a fellow discovered i was from canada he sneered slightly and said canada eh thanks for the bloody geese they were everywhere with all their predictable residue
9037145 they persist for years when all else around them breaks down to damp humus
9037146 i have started doing my laundry in cold water and have purchased a cold water detergent but it is quite a bit more expensive than other varieties what if any advantage is there to using a detergent that specifies it is for cold water
9037147 peter rost has become the drug industrys most annoying and effective online scourge
9037148 what exactly is it that the vp does every day
9037149 my wife and i first dined at 43 degrees north years ago because of their talented young chef evan hennessey
9037150 we were delighted when he returned to the area and became a part of the dunaways opening team now peter and i are thrilled to have evan take us to the next stage with the dunaway he has plans to broaden the menu to appeal to even more people and still uphold the integrity and quality the dunaway is known for
9037151 build upon what the dunaway has achieved already i am excited about expanding the menu and expanding the minds and going forward with our creative local mission
9037152 its a great move for him to have rob evans as a mentor it is an ideal match ben was an integral part of putting the dunaway on the map and he pulled together an ace team here we are happy for him and for evan it is the best of both worlds

9037157 after five years of six feet under and peering into the existential abyss and contemplating the constant presence of mortality and therefore contemplating my own mortality and the general sort of impermanence of everything i was ready to just have a little fun
9037158 were keeping it close to the books but at the same time were adding a lot of stuff because the books are narrated by the main character and there are a lot of other great characters and were creating stuff for them to do
9037159 im working with a lot of new people dan minahan is doing an episode and i think besides myself hes the only director that has worked on six feet under i feel like working with new people you have a chance to learn stuff and honestly i couldnt afford a lot of the people that worked on six feet under there are definitely some the production designer is the same the editor is the same but there are also a lot of new people
9037160 we havent had an official deal for season two yet
9037161 but they have made a deal with the studio for stage space so im assuming were going to have a second season im just waiting for the official pickup i think this show could run for many seasons theres a lot of stuff in there theres a lot of doors to open theres a lot of places to go and the characters and the cast are really phenomenal i mean really really top notch and first rate so you know im hoping
9037162 is it just a coincidence is it part of a larger phenomenon i dont know but i think people seem to love vampires there seem to be a lot of people who are big fans of vampire related material so hopefully they have a lot of things to look forward to our show included
9037163 once hbo greenlit true blood then i figured i cant read anything else about vampires because i dont want to be influenced
9037164 there is nothing confirmed r justin m i think this actually proves a different point
9037165 als iedereen er was er op een fluitje geblazen werd en dan gingen we
9037166 in die tijd werden op kazernes regelmatig pornofilms vertoond ter ontspanning
9037167 dat was voor ons natuurlijk uit den boze op een dag ontdekte iemand waar en wanneer zon nieuwe lading films bezorgd zou worden toen zijn we daar met zijn allen naartoe gegaan hebben die vrachtwagen tegengehouden en hem opengebroken het was een bliksemactie voordat die chauffeur van de schrik bekomen was waren we alweer weg
9037168 maar ik vond het toen wel aardig om de discussie wat minder zwart wit te voeren natuurlijk pornografie is over het algemeen plat maar het probleem is breder kookrubrieken waren vaak net zo plat in die bundel stond een stuk waarin ik analyseerde hoe in de bouquet reeks over seks werd geschreven tot mijn grote verbazing wemelde het in die romannetjes van de halve verkrachtingen en van de mannen die namens de vrouwen beslisten dat die wel zin hadden in seks waarna die vrouwen er dan maar in meegingen
9037169 als sommige acties en teksten van toen nu een beetje onbegrijpelijk overkomen dan geeft dat ook aan hoeveel er veranderd is
9037170 je kunt het je niet meer voorstellen maar in die tijd werden er nog geen vrouwelijke auteurs gelezen bij die studie en als je dan toch virginia woolf wilde lezen werd je meewarig aangekeken o ben je er zo eentje kreeg je dan te horen
9037171 het medisch tuchtcollege weigerde de klachten daarover serieus in behandeling te nemen toen zijn wij uiteindelijk maar voor zijn praktijk folders uit gaan delen dat was illegaal ja de politie arresteerde je daarvoor vanwege het aantasten van iemand in zijn goede naam
9037172 de wet is organisch is altijd in beweging buitenparlementaire acties zijn soms nodig om de wet te veranderen in de jaren zeventig werd je als vrouw volstrekt niet serieus genomen als je aangifte deed van mishandeling door je man of van intimidatie door een dokter dan bedachten we dus zelf iets
9037173 er bleven maar mensen toestromen er werd enorm veel gepraat en gediscussieerd en iedereen liep natuurlijk van alles te organiseren er moest eten verzorgd worden de pers te woord gestaan
9037174 mvm was vooral gericht op het be nvloeden van beleid
9037175 datgene waar sociale bewegingen zich volgens het huidige maatschappelijke klimaat kennelijk toe dienen te beperken
9037176 ja we hadden ook met het bestuur om tafel kunnen gaan zitten maar dit was toch echt effectiever zo zette je mensen aan het denken over man vrouwverhoudingen we kregen toen een heel goede pers leuke jonge meiden met leuke acties zo werden we gezien
9037177 daarbij richt een beweging zich niet op beleid maar probeert de idealen van onderaf vorm te geven
9037178 het misschien wel grootste belang van sociale bewegingen is het inbrengen van nieuwe idee n over de samenleving die bedenk je niet als je alleen maar aan een onderhandelingstafel binnen politiek haalbare marges blijft
9037179 een totaal afgesloten wereld daar kwam je niet buiten dat schoot op een gegeven moment ook wel een beetje door
9037180 en we konden urenlang discussi ren over de vraag tot welke leeftijd jongetjes nog mee mochten met hun moeder naar het vrouwencaf dat die jongens daar op een gegeven moment z lf helemaal geen zin meer in hadden dat kwam niet in ons op
9037181 als je bij a staat en je wilt bij m uitkomen dan moet je heel hard z roepen
9037182 we schminkten ons als heksen en trokken met fakkels langs enge plekken in de stad waar bijvoorbeeld een verkrachting had plaatsgevonden ondertussen schreeuwden we heel hard ja dan werden we wel eens agressief bejegend door mannen en omgekeerd vloog er wel eens een steen door de ruit van een pornobioscoop
9037183 men keek steeds jaloerser naar de traditionele vrouwenorganisaties die wel ingangen bij de politiek hadden we gingen steeds meer keurig in de pas lopen er kwam ook steeds meer subsidie beschikbaar voor initiatieven die van onderop begonnen waren zoals de blijf van mijn lijfhuizen en de vrouwenspreekuren in buurthuizen bovendien kwam de kraakbeweging toen op veel mensen met radicale idee n vluchtten daar toen naartoe achteraf gezien zijn we toen veel creativiteit kwijtgeraakt
9037184 wat heeft die hele inkapseling nou opgeleverd als je al die subsidies bij elkaar optelt dan is dat een schijntje vergeleken bij wat het gekost had om gewoon netjes de pensioenrechten van vrouwen te repareren
9037185 als je tegenwoordig bij de politie aangifte doet van huiselijk geweld zoals dat nog steeds heel knus heet dan komen ze ook echt in actie een pluim daarvoor maar de maatschappelijke deelname van vrouwen is nog steeds beneden peil heel veel mensen stellen ouderschap nog steeds gelijk aan moederschap en vader mag dan af en toe gaan voetballen
9037186 en dan doen we alsof het tussen witte mannen en witte vrouwen allemaal koek en ei is
9037187 dit is een heel groot probleem voor onze gemeente we hadden al onze hoop op dat stuk land gevestigd
9037188 we hebben gewoon niet genoeg scholen en vooral kleuterscholen die 47 hectare zouden de oplossing voor onze problemen zijn
9037189 dit is een moeilijk gevoelig thema weet u vooral ook politiek
9037190 de wet die zegt dat er tegen beslissingen van deze commissie geen beroep kan worden aangetekend is in strijd met de constitutie
9037191 waarom hier de zusters zijn toch in poznan waarom moeten ze hier grond krijgen waarom worden wij opgezadeld met hun probleem
9037192 ik ben diep gelovig katholiek dus als de kerk iets wil dan moet het zo
9037193 iedereen zou zijn bezit moeten terugkrijgen maar de kerk heeft als instituut gewoon veel meer kracht dan individuen hier op deze aarde is geen rechtvaardigheid
9037194 het is even wennen dat wij ons hier druk om maken in nederland we doen heftige pogingen om het nederlanderschap te defini ren vooral door ons af te zetten tegen buitenlanders van allerlei pluimage
9037195 omgangsvormen veranderen per dag in de bronx geven ze elkaar een high five hier zoenen we vrouwen drie keer moet ik ook aan wennen dat deden we niet toen ik dertig jaar geleden vertrok
9037196 we zijn in nederland vergeten wat ons groot heeft gemaakt het nederland dat ik ooit verliet was ondernemend tolerant en individualistisch leven en laten leven was de houding en de mentaliteit die wij naar amerika hebben gebracht die is bepalend geweest voor het succes van new york als centrum van de wereld vrouwen waren ooit naakt op tv bij de vpro nu maken we ons druk om vrouwen in bikinis op billboards niet te geloven
9037197 we gaan amerika achterna toen ik uit dit land vertrok hadden we geen conservatieve orthodoxe christenen in de regering nu wel ik ben voor de serie door de bible belt getrokken en heb gezien hoe de kerkelijke boodschap als product wordt verkocht heel amerikaans met entertainment de politiek idem dito zoals kay van der linde voor verdonk een amerikaans aandoende campagne opzet en de media gaan de verenigde staten ook hard achterna met hypes als joran van der sloot en duyvendak dat graven in iemands verleden om dingen te vinden waar je iemand op kunt pakken dat is een heel amerikaanse manier van doen
9037198 we zijn een tolerant land maar als je kijkt naar de krantenkoppen boevenpak moet weer ingevoerd worden avondklok tegen jongeren lokhoeren ingezet tegen prostituees het is toch bizar dat er belastinggeld wordt besteed om mensen in de val te laten lopen komt ook weer uit amerika overwaaien entrapment heet dat daar we maken ons hier nu druk om happy hours dierenseks en boevenpakjes maar niet om het feit dat je hier wordt wegbelast met de slurptaks ecotaks vliegtaks en verpakkingstaks zo kun je toch niet meer ondernemen
9037199 ja dat kritische is wel heel hollands aan mij amerikanen zijn positief ingesteld daar kan ik jaloers op zijn maar nederlanders behoren wel tot het gelukkigste volken op aarde dat blijkt iedere keer uit onderzoek misschien draagt dat kritische gedoe wel bij tot ons geluk
9037200 nooit eerder in de geschiedenis is er een beschaving geweest die zoveel goeds voor zoveel mensen tegelijk heeft gebracht als de huidige westerse kapitalistische samenleving

9037205 het koning willem i college loopt voorop maar de anderen reageerden positief
9037206 dit kan wel eens een goed antwoord zijn op de problemen van het onduidelijke imago van het mbo
9037207 op een dag vroeg mijn oudste zoon toen vier jaar oud geloven wij god hoezo vroeg ik het dienstmeisje beneden gelooft god o nou wij geloven god niet maar er zijn heel aardige mensen die god w l geloven het gekke is dat ik niet goed weet wat geloven betekent daar heb ik te weinig ervaring mee ik heb nog nooit iemand meegemaakt bij wie het geloof in god en de heilige familie die daar bij hoort zo groot is een collega heeft wel eens tegen mij gezegd zelfs het abstracte godsbegrip van de joden is jou nog te antropomorf en dat noem jij dan athe sme ik wist meteen daar zou je wel eens gelijk in kunnen hebben als je de natuur de wereld ziet dan heb je toch niet k nog eens een extra god nodig hoe henri bergson het precies bedoelde weet ik niet maar er is een betekenis van het begrip l volution cr atrice waarin ik het wel snap de evolutie heeft zichzelf gemaakt daar een of andere grote knutselaar bij te bedenken is eigenlijk een anticlimax
9037208 beeldende kunst raakt het goddelijke niet nee ze s het goddelijke hoe het komt dat ik erdoor ontroerd kan raken zou ik je niet kunnen vertellen misschien hierom de gedachte dat mensen dit kunnen een gewone meneer heeft dit gemaakt zoiets wat zorgt ervoor dat iets me raakt ik weet het niet maar er zijn nog meer wereldraadselen die ik nog niet heb opgelost
9037209 als ik met een hamer op mijn duim sla bestaat de kans dat ik de naam van de schepper ijdelijk gebruik maar ik vind het niet erg als we die schepper zien in de aardige definitie van spinoza waarin god alles is en alles god dan lijkt het me ook nogal kras dat hij gekrenkt zou kunnen worden tot dergelijke menselijke kinderachtigheid acht ik de geest van het heelal niet in staat ik kan met enige ongerustheid kijken naar de vermenigvuldiging van het aantal mensen dat kennelijk beledigd raakt als je hun god of hun profeet beledigt ja ik bedoel mohammedanen maar vrome joden kunnen er ook wat van en met de calvinisten en de katholieken hebben we ook het een en ander meegemaakt ik zal me niet inhouden als iemand me vraagt hoe ik over zijn religie denk zal ik het zeggen of het moet levensgevaarlijk zijn dan zal ik proberen eronderuit te komen ik vind niet dat je eergevoel je dat moet verbieden dit schiet me nu te binnen er is in parijs een gedenkteken voor een of andere chevalier die werd onthoofd omdat hij weigerde een processie te begroeten daar heb ik respect voor das een held hij wist welk risico hij liep en t ch verdomde hij het zich aan te passen
9037210 ik vier de sabbat op geen enkele manier ik kom nooit in sjoel als goede vrienden trouwen of als zij vinden dat hun kind bar mitswa is vind ik het een affront om een uitnodiging te weigeren maar eigenlijk vind ik het zonde van mijn tijd als ik ooit overlijd wil geen religieus gedoe er hoeft voor mij geen kaddisj gezegd te worden ik heb die tekst wel eens gelezen en gedacht nou nou nou is het niet een beetje masochistisch om god te prijzen terwijl hij iemand heeft weggenomen later heb ik begrepen dat hij wordt geprezen omdat hij die persoon heeft laten bestaan dat is beter maar toch laatst werden we uitgenodigd voor een seideravond ik had er absoluut geen zin in maar ik wou ook geen lullige spelbreker zijn dus ik ging mee ik stapte daar binnen en barstte onmiddellijk in tranen uit toen dacht ik nu begrijp ik waarom ik niet wou wat er aan de hand was dat kan ik je niet zo goed uitleggen het thema het is toch een verhaal over bevrijding ontroerde me de herinnering aan opa baard de vader van mijn moeder het zal allemaal meegespeeld hebben al snel daarna dacht ik ik hoop dat ik er volgend jaar niet w r heen moet alles wat met godsdienst te maken heeft en dan ook nog in een taal die ik niet spreek vind ik vervelend ik ken het verhaal van de uittocht uit egypte wel maar op den duur denk ik toch gooi het maar in mijn pet ik heb dezelfde voorgeschiedenis ik weet hoe de dingen zijn gegaan en dat ik afstam van mensen die liever vervolging trotseerden dan dat ze zich lieten dopen vind ik ook wel tof maar verder ik ben jood daar kom ik niet vanaf ik kan hooguit iemand zijn die er niet voor uitkomt ik moet nog vaak denken aan een uitspraak van opa baard hij had het grootste respect voor gedoopte joden zei hij maar als de joden de grote machtige meerderheid zouden vormen en de christenen een kleine verdrukte sekte zou ik nog meer eerbied voor ze hebben gehad
9037211 misschien is het wel erg braaf om te zeggen ik voor mij heb dit gebod helemaal niet nodig ik vind het een vanzelfsprekendheid dat ik mijn vader en moeder eer ik keek tegen ze op doe ik nog steeds ik heb met mijn vader niet veel strijd geleverd ik herinner me daar weinig van het wordt bijna psychoanalytisch om daar op in te gaan maar ik denk dat ik veel te weinig met hem heb geconcurreerd ik denk dat ik instinctief dingen niet deed waar hij jaloers op had kunnen worden bijvoorbeeld hij is nooit gepromoveerd ik ook niet achteraf kan ik zeggen dat ik niet uit was op een academische loopbaan wat is kip en wat is ei ik was onbewust of impliciet bang voor zijn reactie ik denk ook dat hij mijn zuster voortrok omdat hij van haar geen concurrentie op zijn eigen terrein hoefde te duchten er was nooit iemand jaloers bij ons thuis dat heb ik later pas geleerd ik beleef het als een grote errungenschaft een aanwinst de familiemythe te hebben doorbroken door te weten hoe jaloers ik ben mijn moeder was eerlijk een totaal echt iemand ze stelde zich niet aan ze was ook erg geestig toen bij haar een hersentumor werd ontdekt en ze geopereerd moest worden zei ze dit is misschien wel de gelegenheid voor onvergetelijke laatste woorden of zijn dit ze al en vlak voordat we uit het kamp werden bevrijd zei ze tegen me zeg als je nog een pondje boter over hebt mag je je schoenen wel eens invetten ze zien er niet uit en ik ja dat zou geen luxe zijn daar lachten we geen van beiden bij een beeld je wilt je een voorstelling van mijn ouders kunnen maken het waren betrekkelijk kleine mensen daarom ben ik er de laatste tijd pas achter dat ik zelf klein ben terwijl ik mezelf tachtig jaar lang niet als klein heb beleefd haar ogen ik denk dat ik die nu bij wijze van zelfbescherming niet kan zien een diepe blik het spijt me ik heb geen zin om mijn emotionele kunsten te gaan vertonen in een interview ik ben er erg voor als mensen aangedaan raken maar heus het wordt zo droevig als ik ga proberen mijn moeder voor de geest te halen ik merk dat ik dat niet kan ze is er niet meer mijn ouders zijn er niet meer dat maakt me zo verdrietig gemis dat is het toen mijn moeder in 1970 stierf gaf werken troost acht jaar later na het overlijden van mijn vader heb ik veertien dagen niets kunnen doen ik ben geneigd te beamen dat het gemis zo groot is doordat we met zn drie n bergen belsen hebben overleefd maar dat is niet zo het gaat me eerder om de leuke dingen die we hebben meegemaakt dan het gevaar waarin we hebben gezeten weet je wat het is ik weet dat het onredelijk is maar ik betrap mezelf op de gedachte dat het zo langzamerhand te lang begint te duren ze mogen nu eindelijk wel weer eens terugkomen
9037212 in sobibor is een opstand geweest een handjevol mensen heeft het er levend vanaf gebracht zij die daarbij eigenhandig een mof kapot hebben gemaakt blijken je zou het omgekeerde verwachten geen last te hebben van schuldgevoelens ik denk nu wel eens sommige van die nazis had ik zelf dood moeten maken het ging tegen mijn gevoel in en ik heb de kans niet gehad ik zal niet weten of ik de voldoening van de wraak had kunnen smaken het enige wat ik kon doen was mijn wraakgevoelens inslikken de mensen die zich toen zo hebben misdragen zijn n g ouder dan ik nu wat heeft het voor zin om zon ouwe dibbes een stomp voor zijn kop te geven het is frustrerend belemmerend ook geen moord gepleegd en t ch schuldgevoelens survival guilt ik heb nog altijd de neiging om als ik in bepaalde amsterdamse buurten kom mensen die al lang niet meer bestaan mijn excuses aan te bieden dat ik het wel heb overleefd dat ik er nog ben
9037213 je moet iemand gelukkig prijzen die zo dol is op zijn eigen vrouw dat hij een andere vrouw maar behelpen vindt ik geloof niet dat ik principieel monogaam ben maar praktisch ben ik het wel want ik ben 87 en als ik in de tram contact denk te hebben met een leuke vrouw blijkt al snel dat ze voor me opstaat omdat ik een oud baasje ben iemand die niet goed meer op zijn benen staat en kan omvallen in de bocht en zelfs als het om iets anders gaat zou ik er waarschijnlijk niet altijd gebruik van kunnen maken ik ben wat dat betreft dus noodgedwongen zeer monogaam over de tijd die hiervoor ligt over de huwelijkse trouw zullen we er het zwijgen toe doen want ik vind liegen uiteindelijk toch erger dan echtbreken
9037214 meteen komt het kamp weer terug en dan zeg ik dat het een heel essentieel gebod is ja dan denk ik aan situaties waarin ik iemands leven bedreig door van hem te stelen ik heb dat niet gedaan de meeste mensen deden het niet dat viel me wel op eigenlijk hoe fatsoenlijk het grootste deel van de mensen is gesocialiseerd het heeft niets met straf te maken de schande van een ontdekking is al genoeg die naam wil je niet hebben of het nooit geoorloofd is wacht even ik maak een verschil tussen doen en goedkeuren ik kan me voorstellen dat ik chocola pik als ik daar trek in heb en als het toch niet opvalt maar niet van anderen in tijden van hongersnood dan komt het er inderdaad op aan dat zoiets niet gebeurt
9037215 een valse getuigenis spreken waardoor iemand die onschuldig is moeilijkheden krijgt dat is natuurlijk het summum van etterigheid maar liegen om niet zelf te worden betrapt op iets dat niet mag ja dat heb ik meer dan eens gedaan natuurlijk vraag me niet om voorbeelden die willen me niet te binnen schieten loog hij het kamp niemand gelooft dat ik het meen maar in verhouding tot andere kampen was bergen belsen niet zwaar ik weet nog dat een medegevangene een griekse schurk toen we net bevrijd waren zei denk erom dat je wat wij hebben meegemaakt niet bagatelliseert overdrijf het liever dat vond ik vreselijk g nant natuurlijk bagatelliseer ik ik neig altijd naar het understatement als stijlfiguur het werkt ook beter mensen denken dan die meneer overdrijft niet die nemen we serieus ik vind het g nant om dingen op een doorzichtige manier te overdrijven nee niet vanwege de ander bij schaamte blijkt wat andere mensen vinden niet eens zon grote rol te spelen het zijn gefantaseerde anderen schaamte is een heel eigenwijze emotie k bepaal waar ik een figuur mee sla en als iemand zegt o maar das helemaal niet zo erg dat is mij ook herhaaldelijk gebeurd dan denk ik ja ja dat zou ik ook zeggen om iemand op zn gemak te stellen die groep gefantaseerde anderen begint zich vanaf je jeugd te vormen de psychoanalytica mevrouw groen prakken heeft eens bedacht dat het met vies zijn te maken heeft iemand wijst je erop dat je vies bent daar kom je zelf niet op want je kunt je achterste niet zien in een fase van je wording waarin je maximaal afhankelijk bent van je opvoeders hoor je van anderen dingen die g nant zijn of die daardoor g nant worden daar begint het met bestaande anderen die gaandeweg veranderen in anderen die jij bedenkt schaamte is mijn onderwerp ik weet niet hoe het zo ver is gekomen mijn ouders waren boh mien achtig als zij iets gewoon vonden kon je er nooit helemaal op vertrouwen dat het dan ook echt gewoon was dus ga je opletten of denken dat je moet opletten maar schaamte in mijn rol van therapeut is schaamtegevoel een enorme uitdaging want het kost een heleboel moeite en subtiliteit om iemand daarmee te helpen en ik herinner me slechts een paar interventies die geholpen hebben deze is misschien wel leuk iemand was me iets aan het vertellen onderbrak zichzelf en zei toch heb ik het gevoel dat je er tegen bent tegen wat ik je nu vertel in plaats van dat is niet waar of dat denk je maar te zeggen antwoordde ik en moet ik dan op mijn wenken bediend worden waarop die persoon zei dat geeft ruimte hij hoorde dat ik het onderdanige element in de schaamte aanwees dat je het in je macht hebt om te zeggen ik weet dat jij het afkeurt maar ik doe het lekker toch en als je op die mogelijkheid komt dan heb je de afhankelijkheid voor even buiten haakjes gebracht dan zie je dat die afhankelijkheid een fantasie is dat werkt

9037218 want ik hoop dat we ooit nog eens zover komen dat de hele bollenteelt ecologisch verantwoord is
9037219 in 1991 toen hij met een collega op kleine schaal eenderde hectare begon met zijn biobollen was er nog geen markt voor
9037220 de zweden en zwitsers bijvoorbeeld willen vooral grote bollen en die konden we onvoldoende leveren
9037221 maar we kunnen beschikken over een prima stuk land bij lelystad schoon van onkruid bijvoorbeeld ideaal voor de volgens mij noodzakelijke bemesting en middelen om het gewas te versterken
9037222 biologisch teelt is dure arbeidsintensieve teelt dat kan niet iedereen zich veroorloven en zeker als de bank ziet dat de opbrengsten achterblijven stemt dat tot nadenken
9037223 je stuit voortdurend op verrassingen dan komen bijvoorbeeld de bollen mooi uit maar is de steel van de bloem te kort dat soort zaken
9037224 eigenlijk zou iedere biologische tuinder een vader moeten hebben die zegt dat moet je toch anders doen
9037225 nu moet het dier groeien betere producten meer variatie en beter inspelen op wat de markt vraagt

9037286 people are going to be tripping over themselves to get to this guy not only is he a phenomenal competitor not only does he have three above average pitches he is one of the greatest teammates a guy can have he is such a phenomenal presence in the clubhouse
9037287 so hopefully those long passes and runs will all go for touchdowns so we dont have to worry about getting up there and getting a play off in time
9037288 our offensive coordinators and coaching staffs like this because in the past youre always at the mercy of each referee being a little different each crew being a little different now were consistent
9037289 the offensive team can come up and snap it with 39 seconds on the clock or they can let it run all the way down to 1 the offensive team determines the pace at which theyre going to operate not the official
9037290 what i told doug is i want to see where are you going to get the ball ready as opposed to when that 40 seconds starts and how much time do i really have
9037291 if were no huddling people i want that ball and i want our team over that ball with 33 seconds am i going to be able to do it can i snap it with 33 seconds can i speed the game up or can i significantly slow the game down with a 40 second clock

9037295 the womens sites are a great testament to the fact that women not only control the household dollar but are very active participants online
9037296 they are more than half the internet users and more than half the bloggers it is a womans domain
9037297 are increasingly wanting what they want when they want it from people who seem like themselves what blogging brings to the whole online experience whether research shopping or communication is the ability to see what makes people tick and figure out if theyre someone who you trust
9037298 that was definitely a motivation behind our tone and voice for shine
9037299 one thing we learned in researching what we should do with shine is that women feel they do need a place to congregate theyre tribal on some level they want their own little corner a place to nurture each other and help each other out thats the great thing about a womens site you feel like you have a spot where your problems are everyone elses that your worries the things you like to do like shop and your guilty pleasures are shared by other people who are there

9037304 the aaron game used bat value depends on the amount of use
9037305 a signature does not mean that much on a game used bat if the player is still living it is from late in his career which hurts a bit if it shows nice use it should be worth 3 000 to 4 000 an aaron bat from the 1950s is much rarer and worth 15 000 or more the signature might add 200 to the price
9037306 the 1941 bat given to all players coaches and executives is worth around 800 1 000

9037338 we will as a matter of urgency review these documents and within the constraints of national security follow up any matters arising especially as they may pertain to any allegations or evidence of irregularities or wrongdoing relating to the arms deal
9037339 clear up the matter of the south african governments co operation or lack thereof in the investigations into the arms deal
9037340 by accessing the mlas we would be able to hold government to account in terms of whether it assisted the german and british investigations
9037341 we believe that the german investigation was abandoned because of a lack of co operation from south africa and we suspect that the british investigation may likewise also be ended due to a singular lack of assistance from the government

9037353 we had forecast the deficit at r3 8bn because the rand weakened quite a bit against most currencies so exports should have done better
9037354 the oil price was at a record high so obviously this contributed to the figure
9037355 in the light of the further information which has now been disclosed by transnet there is no reason to believe that the sale of shares to lexshell was unlawful in any way or that the transaction in question saw assets being disposed of by transnet substantially below value or in otherwise irregular circumstances

9037381 this part of the bill will be very helpful to ensure the safety of our keiki
9037382 there is no greater punishment than the loss of a child and as a parent of a young child i sympathize with parents who have considered leaving children in their car because the errand will only take a few seconds but this law will help make it clear that the risk is not worth the consequence

9037421 just as we respect the right of married women to wear their wedding rings we also believe that similar treatment and respect must be accorded to hindu women wearing their powdered dots stick on or liquid
9037422 what is seriously concerning is that we are tolerant and accommodative of women who apply cosmetic powder on the whole face but intolerant when other women exercise their customary and religious rights by placing a powdered dot on their forehead

9037505 you see phelpsy took another stroke he cavic took a glide and obviously phelps arms are coming over at a faster pace
9037506 he phelps made the right decision and the other guy made the wrong decision
9037507 but if he phelps had made the other decision he might not have been as lucky and he might have come away with a second and he would have come away with equaling spitzs record
9037508 im not saying he didnt deserve it im saying he did everything he could do to win those golds and he came away with it but at the same time there were little mistakes by other people that allowed him to do that
9037509 i guess what else is left to do for him except come down and win races he hasnt won before
9037510 when you are the greatest swimmer ever i guess you can afford to do that
9037511 hes accomplished so much already he wants to accomplish more
9037512 he better bring his a game because us sprint boys are a different league and we are not going go easy on him
9037513 the other 52 percent will say she damaged him too much and five or six of us will say you should have let us do our job
9037514 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to be president thats a debate id like to have

9037527 this is one emergency that we cant drill our way out of
9037528 even during the cold war during the harsh confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we always avoided direct clashes between our civilians even more so between our military personnel
9037529 ordinary experts even if they teach military affairs should not do so in combat zones but in training areas and training centers
9037530 what was the purpose of that gentleman being among the special forces and what is he doing today i so far cannot answer

9037532 maybe they wont notice that i am taking john mccains straight talk express campaign themes
9037533 i dont think so america knows mccain just sold out the country for a politic tactical stunt the woman has no experience on diversity of economics no national experience with any issue if the 72 year old kicks the bucket so would we as a country this woman is soooooo under qualified

9037541 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 of the time sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 of the time
9037542 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
9037543 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more

9037553 he had written a great book before he was chosen as vice president
9037554 its easy to take shots its part of being a public figure and being in public office you catch a lot of arrows
9037555 al gore knew more about the importance of the rain forest than the scientists
9037556 i asked him a couple of questions and he began a tutorial flying 30 000 feet over the rain forest he told us how the important the rain forest was to the environment and how it affected weather patterns i didnt know that stuff it was one of those life changing moments that ill never forget

9037572 he thoroughly and compellingly explained his plan for change with specific distinctions between what government should be responsible for and personal responsibility
9037573 we must also admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need
9037574 i cant imagine why youd have a hard time making up your mind
9037575 its important to understand how our democracy works not just looking on television but to participate is important to me
9037576 i believe we wouldnt be in iraq in his administration mcnally said
9037577 i think you get the handlers in there and you just get lost
9037578 were corrupting more and more people to care about this stuff
9037579 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
9037580 when he walks out onstage tonight in front of 75 000 to 80 000 people hes a very tangible symbol of whats at stake in a presidential election
9037581 anyone who looks at al gore and whats happened over the last eight years knows whats at stake
9037582 im leaning obama but im still mad its a childish mad but there it is
9037583 i wasnt going to let my disappointment stand in the way of being at what is an historic event
9037584 orangina is a drink which is mainly aimed at children and young people
9037585 the almost sinister portrayal of animals in an animation style filled with sexual innuendo leads to very mixed and confused messages
9037586 in four short years bush turned that around and we now have debt for years to come
9037587 right now we need to campaign on turning virginia from a red state to a blue state
9037588 im talking to people every day who were republicans forever but are just not able to do it this year
9037589 for years and years they bought the plan to cut taxes but the middle class now is beginning to catch up with that idea and understand that a trick has been pulled on them
9037590 i want to vote for somebody who is going to deliver what he says he is going to do
9037591 forget about the wealthy think about the people and help the middle class rather than the wealthy
9037592 we have got a good start but we have our work cut out for us all across the country
9037593 we need to bring the lost to the light and reap the harvest
9037594 this election if probably one of the most important of my grandchildrens lives
9037595 i think historically we have left behind the disadvantaged and the people the policy was developed for
9037596 i think obama has done things more than any candidate to reach out to my generation
9037597 compare that to john mccain who said he barely knew how to use the internet and had to have help from his wife
9037598 the campaign of barack obama and joe biden is a very exciting one
9037599 we want a change that is going to help us all
9037600 their strength is not only how they campaign but how they govern
9037601 this country needs someone with his intelligence honesty and values
9037602 i feel strongly that this country needs to change direction
9037603 seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president
9037604 the question for the american people is whether they can make this odyssey that democratic delegates to the convention made seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president
9037605 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
9037606 because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change
9037607 hes said many times that the primary battle was historic and exciting and that in the end result it would be good for the democratic party that it would energize a lot of people and bring a lot of new people out
9037608 he expected all along that this would resolve itself elegantly and organically and it did
9037609 i think hes very happy with where we are we have a nominee a spectacular nominee and hes going to do everything he can to see him elected
9037610 we think gore can deliver a compelling message on both the economy and foreign policy as relates to energy
9037611 hes a messenger there are a lot of elected officials that voters dont readily accept information from and hes one that they do they think that hes got credibility he has some credibility because a lot of voters believe that if he were elected the last eight years would have been different
9037612 what he has said is that he is not interested in serving in a future administration but that he hasnt ruled out public office and that if he ran for office again it would probably be for president
9037613 he has found a very unique role and platform as a kind of public private citizen able to harness resources creatively to make a huge impact on the climate crisis
9037614 sees the fundamental cause of the worlds problems in the very expansion of homo sapiens
9037615 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9037616 i have contacted some of our church leaders and pastors in orissa as they are watching their houses being destroyed the villagers fled to the nearby jungle and for three days they have had hardly any food
9037617 i have talked with one of our pastors jesus film coach brother ajit and with cracking voice he replied that his family has been in the jungle for three days
9037618 i dont know how our pastors in more remote areas are doing but there are many other places from where it is being reported that many christian homes have been burnt to the ground and people are in deep trouble
9037619 as this region faces tensions that are resulting in violence pray that all parties involved may respond in love and not fear and hate
9037620 and send them to global treasury services 17001 prairie star pkwy lenexa ks 66220
9037621 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
9037622 our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome
9037623 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
9037624 we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
9037625 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families
9037626 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9037627 the experience lincolns supporters valued most was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9037628 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning
9037629 and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
9037630 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
9037631 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
9037632 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9037633 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again the last best hope for those who are called to the cause of peace
9037634 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
9037635 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9037636 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me
9037637 on november 4 we must stand up and say eight years is enough
9037638 let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
9037639 im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
9037640 i dont believe senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
9037641 why else would he define middle class as someone making under us5 million a year
9037642 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9037643 hes now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
9037644 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9037645 look bro we are reaching if not already reached peak oil peak coal and peak natural gas
9037646 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
9037647 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight on nov 4 we must stand up and say eight is enough
9037648 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
9037649 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9037650 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families
9037651 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them gore said
9037652 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9037653 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
9037654 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the startups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
9037655 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9037656 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9037657 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
9037658 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9037659 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
9037660 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
9037661 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
9037662 if like me you still believe america must always be a place called hope
9037663 i went on a trip to europe with my father and mother
9037664 and everywhere we went we were met by vast crowds of people hundreds of thousands of people who came out into the street because they wanted to be near to an american politician and it wasnt because his brother had been martyred three years before
9037665 our nation was the most loved nation on the face of the earth because we were regarded as an exemplary nation
9037666 it took 230 years of discipline restraint and visionary leadership by republican and democratic presidents to build up those vast reservoirs of love and adoration for the united states for the past seven years through monumental arrogance and incompetence we have drained those reservoirs dry anyone who thinks its good for our country when hezbollah is more popular in the middle east than the us has their head in an oil well
9037667 his life has been the 21st century incarnation of the american dream
9037668 gov crist now has an opportunity to make a lasting impact on the florida supreme court much like president bush has been able to do on the u s supreme court
9037669 hell be able to pick people who reflect his judgment and his conservative principles
9037670 theres no better way to accentuate your beliefs than with appointments to the court
9037671 this has not been a partisan court if i thought we were getting ideologues on the court id be concerned
9037672 we worshiped the lord enjoyed his word prayed for our brothers and presented this young couple to the congregation which received them with much love and affection

9037684 we are pleased that the court recognized that the advancement of legal fees is perfectly legitimate and can be necessary to recruit and retain skilled employees in heavily regulated professions
9037685 the prosecutors were wrong to treat fee advancement as reason for suspicion
9037686 the first half of 2008 was the coolest for at least five years the world meteorological organisation wmo said on wednesday
9037687 summer heat continues in short supply continuing a trend that has dominated much of the 21st centurys opening decade
9037688 there have been only 162 days 90 degrees or warmer at midway airport over the period from 2000 to 2008 thats by far the fewest 90 degree temperatures in the opening nine years of any decade on record here since 1930
9037689 the almanacs 2009 edition which goes on sale tuesday says at least two thirds of the country can expect colder than average temperatures with only the far west and southeast in line for near normal readings
9037690 based on the past armagh measurements this suggests that over the next two decades global temperatures may fall by about 2 degrees c that is to a level lower than any we have seen in the last 100 years
9037691 a great interest in keeping the market liquidity here in our continent in creating new products developing bilateral relations among countries to prevent a flight of capital or investment to other places
9037692 our idea is not acquisitions but cooperation if it is necessary to invest in new trading platforms product development or invest in people we are prepared to meet and work together
9037693 you then seek to create a network with the exchanges in chile peru and colombia by using cooperation partnership and not by creating a single entity to manage the markets in the region
9037694 i think this is going to be a real problem for us
9037695 that thing is almost all ash tree end to end
9037696 being in like minded company with people who support the cause
9037697 it was inspiring to see the mix of black and white old and young
9037698 we must seize this opportunity to elect united states of america
9037699 if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis
9037700 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9037701 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of mankind
9037702 we started out with a camp of 60 and it grew to 80
9037703 then we did a camp for four local primary schools we had 200 at this camp
9037704 he would meet them for dinner meet them at their hotel meet them at the childrens home or just call up for a chat he wanted to practice his english but he was also intrigued by these people
9037705 he had many conversations about life about christianity he was curious as to why these students would come all this way to help a bunch of people they didnt even know
9037706 he said he saw our faith was real he saw that it meant something in our lives and he wanted to know more about this
9037707 they were able to give patrick a bible in thai english he was so excited this was not an easy time for patrick though that night his mother caught him reading it and told him he was not to read it anymore since then patrick has told his mother he will continue to read his bible she hasnt really said anything in response but patrick is too scared to bring other christian things into his house
9037708 oh can you take care of her oh maybe you can spare her several moments of your consideration leading up to the final destination
9037709 oh the earth is calling out i wanna learn what its all about but everything i read global warming going green i dont know what all this means but it seems to be saying wake up america
9037710 hes a hero hes going to bring pollution down to zero
9037711 i know that you dont want to hear it especially coming from someone so young
9037712 stand up ill try if you will wake up its not a fire drill
9037713 once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches this transition
9037714 the question simply put is will we seize the opportunity for a change
9037715 why is the election so close its close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
9037716 and then let us leave here tonight and take that message of hope from denver
9037717 and do everything we can to serve our nation our world and our children and their future by electing barack obama president of the united states of america
9037718 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
9037719 involved engaged and getting briefings and working to make sure that the federal assistance is there
9037720 now is the time to prepare yourself your family and your friends
9037721 one of the most important lessons we learned after hurricane katrina was that there is no substitute for awareness and self help especially in the days before a hurricane is predicted to hit
9037722 no no jimmy stewart for governor ronald reagan for best friend
9037723 sportsmen have been stereotyped as concerned with one issue guns but if you listen to sportsmen as i have over the years we hear a different story
9037724 democrats are all about conservation they are all about preservation i think thats a huge opportunity
9037725 with sen obama you have a lifetime record of supporting gun control voting for gun control speaking out against gun rights and voting against gun rights either as an elected official or a private citizen
9037726 the carbon based interests oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for everything its worth
9037727 some of the best marketers have the worst products and this is certainly true of todays republican party
9037728 living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant no matter how friendly and even tempered the beast one is affected by every twitch and grunt
9037729 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families we would not be showing contempt for the constitution wed be protecting the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation

9037731 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
9037732 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
9037733 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9037734 the five senators alan cranston d ca dennis deconcini d az john glenn d oh john mccain r az and donald w
9037735 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 8 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
9037736 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
9037737 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
9037738 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9037739 weve had thousands die in the first few years and mccain wants to keep it up for 100 more years
9037740 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
9037741 so long as they are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9037742 this is as extensive a landscaped area as we have in the village
9037743 we thought we would take the initiative and try to come up with some ideas
9037744 our intent would be wild flowers perennials things that take care of themselves and regenerate every year
9037745 we know that will be a considerable item to discuss
9037746 we will not be agreeable to any kind of ssa that would put an additional burden
9037747 now we think its our turn to get something back from the village
9037748 in our opinion the bank of canada would have great difficulty explaining how a faster than expected deterioration in the economy would justify inaction for another month and a half until the next interest rate announcement in october

9037754 this is no ordinary time this is no ordinary election
9037755 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
9037756 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
9037757 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
9037758 candidate dialogue does not seem to help anyone learn during a campaign
9037759 there are not many papers that go right to the core of some of the assumptions of democratic theory the way this one does
9037760 c andidate dialogue does not seem to help anyone learn during a campaign
9037761 there are the hard core more conservative ones who will vote for him but hold their nose
9037762 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
9037763 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
9037764 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
9037765 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
9037766 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
9037767 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year

9037770 i think it will help the show draw people every year a lot of people have never seen a steam engine let alone a working one
9037771 every day they threaten me and want to drive me out of ossetia
9037772 it was a concerted action of russian official military forces together with paramilitaries
9037773 they aim at pushing georgians out of their villages to make sure they have no place to return to
9037774 emphasize the need for russian authorities to hold these militias accountable
9037775 we will not leave georgian houses orchards nothing we will erase them from the face of earth
9037776 praja rajyam peoples rule party in the temple town tirupati the actor and his advisors woke up to their shoddy homework
9037777 names of several political parties are registered every year by individuals with or without political clout these are one person outfits and matter little at the political arena
9037778 it is time the election commission reconsiders its norms for registering a political party and make them as stringent as for recognition of party
9037779 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
9037780 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
9037781 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
9037782 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
9037783 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
9037784 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
9037785 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
9037786 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
9037787 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
9037788 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
9037789 the most powerful country in the world to the weakest
9037790 why do they dislike intelligence in this country in leaders
9037791 i knew abe abe was a friend of mine and baracks no lincoln
9037792 senator i knew abe lincoln abe lincoln was friend of mine senator youre no abe lincoln
9037793 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
9037794 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9037795 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace who yearn for a better future
9037796 america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to walk into the future
9037797 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
9037798 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
9037799 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush

9037826 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
9037827 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
9037828 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
9037829 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
9037830 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
9037831 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later

9037890 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
9037891 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
9037892 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
9037893 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
9037894 when people rightly complain about higher gasoline prices we propose to give more money to the oil companies and pretend that theyre going to bring prices down
9037895 i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
9037896 the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
9037897 over time wall street firms began to trade against their clients for their own account such that now the direct investment activities of a firm like goldman sachs dwarf their activities on behalf of outside customers
9037898 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
9037899 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome

9037901 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
9037902 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
9037903 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
9037904 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
9037905 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
9037906 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
9037907 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
9037908 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
9037909 the next six months are going to tell the story
9037910 why dont these bloody people just knock their nonsense off
9037911 as perplexed as people whod togged up for a fancy dress party and gone to the wrong address
9037912 at their age i was disdaining the opportunity of a free university education in favour of loafing and trying to scratch a living as a rock journalist theyd voyaged halfway around the world to fix a busted country
9037913 the soldiers swept their rifles back and forth up and down then gathered in a corner
9037914 this is ridiculous observed rana correctly we stopped so did the soldiers i told the one who seemed to be in charge that he was spoiling our walk youre spoiling our patrol he grinned
9037915 who arent doing smart things that they should or are doing daft things they shouldnt

9037920 palin is young hard working and a person hard to put away was one comment that emerged
9037921 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
9037922 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
9037923 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
9037924 using the net map method to understand the political economy of social sector interventions
9037925 power control is key to the mobile and network success if the ue requires too much downlink power then the base station or node b can run out of transmitter power and this is what was happening as you get more ues on the cell the noise floor rises and the cell has to compensate by ramping up its power to the ues
9037926 if the ue power control algorithm is faulty then they will demand more power from the cell than is necessary and with multiple users this can cause the cell transmitter to run out of power the net result is that some ues will drop their call i have seen the dropped call graphs that correspond to the iphone launch and when the 2 0 2 firmware was released the increase in dropped calls
9037927 the power control issue will also have an effect on the data throughput because the higher the data rate the more power the node b transmitter requires to transmit if the ues have poor power control and are taking more power than is necessary then it will sap the networks ability to deliver high speed data
9037928 this is one of the reasons why at amp t has been sending text messages to users to persuade them to upgrade to the 2 0 2 software in a mixed environment where users are running 2 0 2 0 1 and 2 0 2 the power control problems of 2 0 and 2 0 1 will affect the 2 0 2 users
9037929 it is not the network that is fault but the interaction of the bad power control algorithm in 2 0 and 2 0 1 software and the network that is at fault the sooner everybody is running 2 0 2 software the better things will be having seen the graphs the 2 0 2 software has already started to make difference
9037930 hi virgo thank you for being a fan of my work in the media machine

9037960 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race

9037962 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
9037963 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
9037964 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates

9038254 i have always had a plan to come back to australia and i still believe i have this option open
9038255 its just a matter of convincing my family it is very hard its my wife and my mother and my mother in law
9038256 in such situations russian diplomats will have to leave georgia
9038257 georgia expects political and economic aid from the upcoming eu summit
9038258 will be personally involved in the efforts aimed at supporting georgia
9038259 i have seen no sign of return in those georgian villages north of tskhinvali
9038260 human rights watch researchers personally witnessed ossetian militias looting and burning down ethnic georgian villages during their research in the area
9038261 these satellite images indicate just how widespread the torching of these villages has been in the last two weeks
9038262 winston peters has been found guilty by a large number of journalists and politicians when in fact he is completely innocent in respect of these allegations
9038263 there hasnt had to be a lengthy argument about it at all
9038264 as late as this morning he was saying it would take five minutes for the sfo to clear it up
9038265 if its as simple as that winston peters would have presented that information months ago
9038266 there is an enormous talent going to waste in our parliament
9038267 if he is going to stay it is the big job that he needs to do
9038268 everyone has realised that peter costello is by far and away the best performer in parliament and we are a better team with him
9038269 i am sure we will find an accommodation for brendan
9038270 on advice i am relinquishing all of my practice and income
9038271 its to ensure my wife has a clear run as governor general without my being in the marketplace
9038272 this is a little legacy and keeping the name is very good for the business that is buying my practice
9038273 the 5 0 thing puts a lot more extra pressure on us as it would take us up to second in the world rankings
9038274 that is the kind of pressure we want pressure is a privilege and if we win 5 0 it takes us right up to the top it is something we have talked about and if we deliver we can win 5 0 the dressing room is very happy place
9038275 we are putting pressure on their batters and playing to our potential were hitting their good balls for four and doing a really good job on them
9038276 i know south africa really well and they wanted to beat us they are very proud people and stubborn people
9038277 the cricket we are playing is not good cricket but england are playing unbelievable cricket they are one of the best one day sides we have played against recently
9038278 it has always been a dream to play for england as an individual you couldnt ask for more i played against south africa for the lions and although it was always going to be tough they knew i could bat
9038279 his recent form with the bat is another triumph for new captain kevin pietersen who has promoted the all rounder up the order and persuaded steve harmison a crucial figure in this series out of one day international retirement
9038280 the management of alitalia will remain in the hands of italians

9038282 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
9038283 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers

9038285 yes thats where i was supposed to go thats what i had planned
9038286 we want to have a strong penetration in the northeast
9038287 in particular with washington and virginia there seems to be a very strong demand for early childhood education from what weve seen in the market the biggest challenge is that theres a lot of competition going in as well
9038288 john mccain has chosen wisely in selecting governor sarah palin as his running mate john mccain has again demonstrated his judgment and his commitment to conservative values fiscal discipline and reform
9038289 i had the opportunity to meet with gov sarah palin on my recent trip to anwr i found her to be very down to earth and personable she is a person who would feel at home in southern indiana she hunts and fishes and is pro life
9038290 sarah palins selection is an outstanding example of john mccains willingness to reach out to fresh voices embrace new leadership and continue the republican partys strong support of conservative women leaders
9038291 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
9038292 what is it exactly that the v p does every day
9038293 many newspapers have already passed the point of opportunity for those who have not made the transition technology and market factors may be too strong to enable success
9038294 south east asia has plummeted to levels it took europe 150 years to reach in just 30 years
9038295 the span of fertility across countries has never been wider
9038296 both extremes cause their own problems if europe continues at 1 5 the population will halve every 65 years if africa continues with half its population under 15 it will continue to consume more than it produces making it harder to escape from poverty and illiteracy
9038297 people are very bad at calculating survival probabilities twenty years ago fertility started to decline in nepal and bangladesh when they were still poor korea wasnt rich when fertility declined by contrast the gulf oil states continued with high birthrates long after they got huge wealth
9038298 in africa most women work in agriculture around the home
9038299 but in bangladesh women get out and meet other women at work who may be using contraception getting outside the home fixes a new social norm prosperity and fertility are interlinked in a chicken and egg way
9038300 food sex and procreation are core elements of humanity and changes to them are often met with fierce hostility
9038301 in my view the evidence is that there is something intrinsic to the culture its there in the rich muslim states in the gulf in saudi arabia and in the muslim provinces of the former soviet union it is perhaps bound up with the status of women
9038302 not just in catholic spain and italy but in orthodox greece the strong traditions are not boosting fertility rate as many might suppose
9038303 this is shrimp we lookin at here this is schools of shrimp
9038304 we going through a swamp im workin on top of where my grandfathers walked they was hunting on this very spot where im catching shrimp can you imagine
9038305 i would say im in them i know im in them i know they gonna be a little while and they all belong to the lil rick
9038306 look like about 1 500 pounds of shrimp on the drag
9038307 while i was up there i was fussing fussing and raising heck just fussing at that hurricane i was furious out of my mind angry
9038308 i dropped them booms down and said let it blow blow blow blow and let me tell you that she did she blew blew blew blew
9038309 thirty forty people that slept on this boat that first night
9038310 hundreds of people just lined up on the bayou floating on boats you look at the movie
9038311 you know thats disturbing to hear these people crying could you imagine hearing these people crying for four five days and it never did stop
9038312 i play the horn to calm em down and make em see a little laugh come out of these poor people that was crying
9038313 my biggest flashback is thinkin about my daddy he committed suicide put a rope on his neck and committed suicide three months after the hurricane i lose my daddy yknow its just one of them it added to the problem we already had
9038314 a day like today he catches 1 500 pounds of shrimp but hes gonna go to the dock now and get a dollar and a half a pound
9038315 and where you and i live those same shrimp are showing up in the supermarket for 16 50 a pound
9038316 somebodys making money but its not the gulf shrimper and this its an endangered species
9038317 thats right and the culture that in a strange way its sort of knitted into the fabric of the landscape
9038318 once its gone you cant put it back together again
9038319 the good you know hard down family people is gone
9038320 she seemed totally out of place with the trodden down beaten down place in the middle of skid row
9038321 i asked her if i could take her photograph and she looked up and said ive been waiting for someone to take a good photograph of me
9038322 by seeing these historical or legendary characters with the faces of people you could pass on the street any day it helps us see it as something thats relevant to our lives
9038323 the themes that animate history are themes that resonate in our lives all the time
9038324 here it is the street thats named for him is where the wanderers gather and where the clinics that serve the wanderers are located
9038325 if you can find the sacred in the world around you rather than in something thats distant and apart from you
9038326 then maybe you can be better integrated to the world you live in
9038327 the management of alitalia will remain in the hands of italians
9038328 prospective foreign partners will take a stake in the new company only as minority shareholders

9038330 you would think it would be easy to figure out what dogs like but it took us six months to get there
9038331 were also avoided apparently dogs from bad neighborhoods thought they sounded too much like gun fire
9038332 dr kim told me the others were too complicated and that the dogs wouldnt understand them
9038333 its the most cheerful album ive ever made in my life
9038334 people tell me they cant get it out of their heads this is what every songwriter wants to hear
9038335 if i hear that song one more time ill commit suicide
9038336 its hard to put a bunch of cats in one room for focus groups
9038337 do not press the alarm give me all the large bills in your drawer i have a gun i do not want to hurt anyone no dye no bait money you have 10 seconds
9038338 it is really critical that people are fire safe this labor day conditions are extremely dry and the weather is expected to remain warm and breezy throughout the long weekend
9038339 you need to douse the fire with plenty of water and watch it if it hisses smokes and steams there is probably live fire still within the campfire grate the next step is to stir it exposing the live coals and then douse it again the stirring and dousing process needs to be repeated until you can place your hand near the fire grate and feel no heat it may take 10 gallons of water to fully put out a fire too many times people let their fire burn down covered with gray ash and they leave it thinking it is out but it is not even if there are no live flames there could be live coals
9038340 and do not shovel dirt on the fire that just covers the burning embers which can rekindle if winds pick up to correctly put out a campfire you need to start at home before you leave on your trip you must plan to have the right tools with you a shovel and a large container for water to fully extinguish it make a plan

9038344 our media why wont they tell us more about global issues i e darfur
9038345 several of the displaced told unhcr that they had fled fighting earlier this month and had just returned to their homes over the past weekend
9038346 they talked about militias entering the villages shooting in the air harassing the inhabitants and looting their property there were no new arrivals on thursday from the villages in the buffer zone to gori but our teams are closely monitoring any new displacement on the ground
9038347 we remain concerned about elderly and chronically ill people particularly those living in isolated villages in all the areas affected by the fighting
9038348 security situation is still volatile as has been said with a large presence of weapons firearms a substantial number of people trying to return home are on the move and may feel in danger
9038349 the weather is extremely hot which is exacerbating the conditions
9038350 the hygiene conditions are very bad the hand pumps for clean drinking water are not good enough sanitation facilities people are defecating in open spaces this is obviously extremely risky in terms of spreading disease and we already have heard cases of fever and diarrhea have been reported so the immediate priority certainly as far as unicef is concerned is to deliver life saving supplies of medicine food clean drinking water and access to proper sanitation
9038351 also what we have heard is that around 5 000 people from bihar state have crossed into nepal to seek relief from the floods many of the displaced are sheltering in schools what we understand is around 30 percent of those are children
9038352 im going to do my best during that and thats it

9038360 it is very difficult to try a homicide multiple decades after the crime
9038361 well be carefully reviewing our options and will determine whether or not we can go forward were not going to give up easily on something as serious as the murder of a police officer
9038362 reversal of clarks conviction is necessary to ensure fairness and integrity of the judicial process
9038363 but it doesnt take anything away from what this did to both families
9038364 weve always felt he was wrongly convicted and there wasnt sufficient evidence were tremendously pleased with this decision
9038365 bottom line clark received a fair trial and the jury made a just decision

9038367 i watched my children wait by the window for their daddy to come home
9038368 i am pro life and i believe that marriage should only be between a man and a woman
9038369 palin said shes not out to judge anyone and has good friends who are gay but that she supported the 1998 constitutional amendment defining marriage between a man and a women elected officials cant defy the court when it comes to how rights are applied she said but
9038370 i believe that honoring the family structure is that important

9038387 ok but dean doesnt like all this cloak and dagger stuff who exactly are we hiding from anyway
9038388 when we get to the bottom of this well know the answer to that question just be ready and try to relax were earning a lot of brownie points and i for one intend to collect
9038389 ok chief whats the hurry only medical personnel are allowed back here oh youre the guy that dropped off that nice mr kenfer a few hours ago
9038390 right there wasnt much time for introductions when i brought mr kenfer in my names melman im mr kenfers personal assistant and i have returned to gather him up we have business this afternoon that requires his presence
9038391 mr kenfer left here right after his treatment was completed he said something about needing to get to his office and his something something phone i couldnt hear him all that well he was talking softly as he walked away toward the door he seemed to be in quite the hurry
9038392 i know we are a bit ruffled around here but we still need to maintain simple courtesy before entering the private space of others
9038393 sorry about that mr kenfer but i was worried about you not being down at the medical station and wasnt thinking luckily the nurse heard you mumbling as you left giving me a clue where you might be
9038394 i take it that you needed secure communications or you could have waited for me and made your call from medical
9038395 yep needed to give jordan keller a heads up and this is as good a time and place as any to let you in on what i intend to do
9038396 i let keller know that if i say or do anything that is contrary to the information in the files of our investigation that i sent to him it will be just to try and smoke out any possible internal operatives working as spies in the center
9038397 let me get this straight you plan to falsify some information in the meeting down in the command center you cant suspect benson or his staff mates
9038398 ive known benson for years he would never get involved in anything like this and his friends karl and dean have the same relationship with benson as benson and i do
9038399 and i appreciate being let in on the plan benson has everything ready to go so if you dont have any other stops to make lets get going

9038414 agradezco la oportunidad que me brindaron hab a que salir a girar no irse afuera ya que era una gran responsabilidad para ellos al darnos el auto y para nosotros tambi n en cuanto al comportamiento del mismo es muy d cil ingresa bien a las curvas me sorprendi el poder frenante que tienen como se sostiene doblando la velocidad de curva y como se afirma al piso es muy importante que nos permitan girar y trabajar con ellos
9038415 es todo muy lindo nunca hab a manejado un auto con techo al principio me cost un poco adaptarme a la caja pero despu s mejor y pude girar m s c modo el volante es muy liviano y las sensaciones muy buenas el equipo me explic todos los detalles del auto
9038416 es algo hermoso el auto va muy bien y te permite muchas cosas como por ejemplo moderar el acelerador ya que en las curvas hay que esperarlo para acelerarlo porque sino te saca la trompa es muy firme y tienen un gran freno estoy agradecido a esta oportunidad que me brind la familia berta
9038417 estoy muy feliz muy contento de tener esta oportunidad y de trabajar con tanta gente profesional a mi lado la caja secuencial es mucho m s f cil pero hay que tratarle con mucho cuidado el auto es incre ble me sent muy c modo
9038418 es algo incre ble estoy muy contento la sensibilidad es tremenda en todo sentido para frenar doblar y sobre todo para la caja de velocidades que hay que tratarla con mucho cuidado
9038419 es magnifico todo muy lindo la verdad que me qued con ganas de m s aunque tambi n muy contento al principio me cost adaptarme a la caja de velocidades y una vez que le agarr la mano se me termin la sesi n
9038420 los autos aceleran muchisimo pens que eran pesados y algo ind ciles pero realmente es todo lo contrario es como un f rmula por como acelera y frena me cost algo la caja secuencial al inicio pero luego mejor es realmente sensacional esta prueba y esta oportunidad que se nos presenta

9038428 for a long time we thought it was our own private business how we feed ourselves but now we understand there are consequences

9038472 there is no technical reason that a third party could not accumulate and assemble the hardware components in an apple labeled computer hardware system such that said system would be capable of running the mac os
9038473 the kernel panic is self induced by apples embedding of code to prevent operability on computer hardware systems that are not apple labeled computer hardware systems
9038474 the mac os market is distinct and unique as compared to other operating systems including but not limited to the windows operating system
9038475 as such psystar alleges that the windows operating system is not and cannot be considered an effective substitute for the mac os the same holds true for any other operating system
9038476 apple is free to control and charge customers supra competitive prices
9038477 apple has at the least substantially lessened competition in the mac os capable computer hardware systems marketplace if not eliminated it in its entirety and as a result maintains its monopoly position with respect to the mac os and the artificially created apple labeled computer hardware system

9038499 if we name the building after steve irwin it would be a good move on the schools part the school would get publicity and that would make more kids want to come to this school

9038505 this is as extensive a landscaped area as we have in the village
9038506 we thought we would take the initiative and try to come up with some ideas
9038507 our intent would be wild flowers perennials things that take care of themselves and regenerate every year
9038508 we know that will be a considerable item to discuss
9038509 we will not be agreeable to any kind of ssa that would put an additional burden
9038510 now we think its our turn to get something back from the village

9038520 monty has got enough work to do this week to try to make the side
9038521 he should be getting his head down and trying to play good golf
9038522 to be told what to do by one so young and inexperienced the only reason we said a hot line to nick faldo is because ian is the only one who has said he has been speaking to nick has anyone else said that no
9038523 monty has never lost a ryder cup singles and until he does he should be given a chance
9038524 i havent had much time to myself since coming back from beijing and all celebrations have been postponed until the end of the season but the work has not stopped i have been back in training preparing for my remaining races

9038526 when you are in the olympics you are in a kind of bubble so you do not really see or hear much of what is going on at home but i have since heard so many things from people who were watching the race on television
9038527 just knowing that on the tuesday afternoon of my race so many people had put down what they were doing to watch that is a nice thing to take to my bed at night but only when i have finished racing for the summer can i really relax and celebrate winning my gold medal
9038528 then i can do what i want it will be nice to stay in bed get up after 10 oclock and go to mcdonalds thats what athletes do isnt it

9038545 the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church
9038546 what the politburo said was tantamount to public censure according to section 19 of our party constitution
9038547 had it been so a censure the pb statement would have mentioned it as it was done in the case of subhas chakraborty earlier
9038548 we have neither publicly nor privately censured both kinds are officially possible
9038549 the central committee publicly censured comrade subhas chakraborty member of the state secretariat of west bengal for making statements challenging the party line he should conform to the norms of the party
9038550 he has been publicly censured its a punishment according to our party constitution bhattacharjee has accepted it
9038551 the pb statement came in the wake of a report from bose on the chief ministers anti bandh comments buddhababu didnt oppose the party line in the meeting a secretariat member said
9038552 i had made the partys position that it supports the right to strike clear at the party function on wednesday in the presence of the chief minister he bhattacharjee didnt oppose it
9038553 i dont think it was a public censure as the politburo has merely stated its difference from the chief minister on the issue konar said
9038554 otherwise how can he continue to be in the party he will have to leave
9038555 the whole thing is so political that we did not want to go public with this until we were sure it worked and now we are
9038556 beyond the accidents at bhopal india in 1984 and chernobyl ukraine in 1986
9038557 arsenic in drinking water is a major public health hazard and should be dealt with as an emergency
9038558 the exposure to oxygen has the effect of precipitating the arsenic
9038559 after a time lapse of a few hours the water is sent back into the well after a while the arsenic drops below the hazardous level
9038560 also there is no way of knowing when they stop working we need many many many treatment plants but each one can deal with 100 households
9038561 one is at kasimpur 25km north of calcutta airport another at basirhat 100km from calcutta near the bangladesh border
9038562 arsenic is present in the mineral matters deposited in the form of silt by major rivers in west bengal and bangladesh
9038563 the arsenic bearing minerals exist in the shallow aquifer zones up to 200ft of the region
9038564 one popular theory of the presence of arsenic in the aqueous phase is biochemical activity of soil bacteria which uses arsenic bearing minerals as a source of oxygen intensive agriculture that uses high quantities of fertiliser further accelerates the bacterial action the dissolved form of arsenic is far more toxic than the mineral form which is abundant in the subterranean zone of the bengal delta
9038565 at once realised that the precipitation process which removes the iron also precipitates the soluble arsenic we did not have to invent something new
9038566 i did my chemical engineering degree from jadavpur then my masters from the indian institute of science in bangalore
9038567 at queens university belfast i shifted from the department of chemical engineering to civil engineering where i am a senior lecturer in environmental engineering
9038568 the new plant will be maintained and operated by local village technicians
9038569 to help apply the technology to other areas in the south asian region the world bank has given a grant of 200 000 to set up six more subterranean water treatment plants in the gangetic plains of west bengal
9038570 what will shibu soren do alone after four decades of sustained struggle jharkhand was created eight years back but there has been no change in ground realities
9038571 this state accounts for one third of the countrys mineral resources more than 50 per cent people living here are below poverty line not to speak of our unirrigated lands the dams and canals too have dried up despite having spent millions of rupees i can change it soon with your support and help i urge opposition members as well to vote for me
9038572 all are equal in jharkhand there is no dispute over insiders and outsiders the term diku refers to such people who constantly create trouble and force poor tribals to flee
9038573 we demanded action against all the legislators but the speaker chose to only oblige the treasury bench todays protests were necessary to bring the issue in assembly proceedings we will soon approach the apex court for justice
9038574 we need your imaginative and proactive involvement and this forum is the right place for this i think instead of meeting once a year this forum can serve as the link between the doner and the industry 365 days a year
9038575 we have decided to play facilitator between the industry and the other government departments to boost the it sector in the northeast you should see how you fit into the northeast picture by looking at the larger picture instead of the it sector importing manpower from the region the it industry should come to the northeast
9038576 things have improved and will be so more once you come in lack of five star hotels should not be a deterrent other things will fall in place look at bangalore it was not like this from the outset we are seeking a true partnership between the centre state and the it industry in the region please look beyond your bottomline
9038577 i would like you all to come forward and help set up the centre and we will do every bit to facilitate it i would be more than happy to applaud any such public private partnership initiative sitting in the crowd instead of getting applauded at seminars and workshops
9038578 on top of that if we are restricted to less than 20 seats their morale will plummet
9038579 the management told us over the phone not to come today we wont let any party spoil our career by doing politics

9038582 trinamul supporters were on their way to the dharna and there could have been a clash
9038583 we were surprised when the management declared a holiday although we understand they did it for our safety after yesterdays road blockade in front of the factory gates
9038584 the day i heard the tatas would set up a car factory here i began dreaming i could not believe it when they selected me seven months ago now i dont know what the future holds
9038585 i bought a packet of sweets ill never forget the pleasure of buying my parents and sister something with my own hard earned money
9038586 my parents dream had come true when tata selected me now mamata is playing with the fate of over 150 families
9038587 every morning when we go to the factory they shout at us
9038588 we renew the appeal for a peaceful settlement of the singur imbroglio by way of a meeting with you in the course of the meeting between the chief minister and mamata all the issues that you have raised will be fully discussed
9038589 your problems at the time were induced by your own drug abuse
9038590 now having been kept away from drugs you are behaving perfectly well and dont present a danger to anyone at all

9038606 winston peters has been found guilty by a large number of journalists and politicians when in fact he is completely innocent in respect of these allegations
9038607 there hasnt had to be a lengthy argument about it at all
9038608 as late as this morning he was saying it would take five minutes for the sfo to clear it up

9038622 but my question to the minister is does it make more sense to have five dangerous people out on the street right now or would we have been better off to have some people brought in and do the proper searching

9038639 the 5 0 thing puts a lot more extra pressure on us as it would take us up to second in the world rankings
9038640 that is the kind of pressure we want pressure is a privilege and if we win 5 0 it takes us right up to the top it is something we have talked about and if we deliver we can win 5 0 the dressing room is very happy place

9038676 jen stepped into the chic wine bar adjusting the strap of her knockoff prada as she glanced around hopefully
9038677 jen reached the bar and sat down with a thump

9038685 these oligosaccharides pass through the upper intestine largely unchanged and when these reach the lower intestine bacteria feed on them producing copious amounts of flatus

9038691 sarah palin is a strong vice presidential pick that represents a fresh breath of air for those looking for representation in this election and someone who will make a difference in washington dc as a soon to be mom myself i admire what sarah palin has been able to achieve as both a professional executive rising to the level of governor as well as being a mom of five children with three daughters one son off to iraq in only a few weeks and a baby boy with the challenges of downs syndrome she has been a successful manager both of a state and her family one of the issues important to me is the pain we all face at the pump there is no one that knows the issue of rising oil prices and how we can solve this problem better than someone who knows alaska and its issues like sarah palin lastly i cant stop thinking of the irony that hillary clinton was able to get so many women excited about politics and what a woman could do but it is the republican party not the democrat party that is leading the way and elevating a smart and qualified woman like sarah palin to its 2008 ticket to win the white house i feel confident that governor palin should be able to carry on the mantle left to her by geraldine ferraros 1984 run connect with women as a new and refreshing face and close the deal to help us win in 2008 as a young professional and mom to be i am looking forward to campaigning for the mccain palin ticket
9038692 we are impressed by and proud to be involved with the gulf region kidney communitys advance readiness to ensure that its kidney patients will be well cared for during this potential weather crisis
9038693 because thrice weekly dialysis treatments can never stop for esrd patients a high level of coordination among physicians providers patients caregivers and other volunteers like that seen here in louisiana to provide continuous high quality care is critical
9038694 the company has to our knowledge the only pre established pristine compound with approximately 400 beds and a fully operational office with commercial kitchens and laundry facilities in the new orleans baton rouge area and we have been there since the work we performed during hurricane katrina as soon as the storm passes we believe we will be the first company able to assist in the recovery efforts to not only get our clients back in operation but others as well if you need our assistance please contact us at our 24 hour operational hot line 1 800 282 8701 we have helped many during many hurricanes katrina wilma charlie and ivan to name a few our baton rouge office is also open 24 hours a day 225 667 9388 our disaster recovery team is also available jeffery 516 779 7823 eric 516 779 7053 and myself 516 779 7816
9038695 thomas has been a valued member of our senior management team and we thank him for his significant contributions to the company over the last four years we wish him all the best in his future endeavors
9038696 i am proud to have been associated with movie gallery and continue to believe in its great potential i have reached a point in my career where i have the unique opportunity to pursue new challenges and i am looking forward to doing so
9038697 we need to talk about these things not just when a storm is staring us in the face and certainly not only after disaster strikes and another community is devastated
9038698 why be resigned to picking up pieces over and over again instead of keeping the pieces in place to begin with there is a new and better path to preserving homes and communities it is time to move down that path in this country before it is too late
9038699 when appropriate wind resistance and flood elevation are originally built in to a structure it can provide effective passive protection for the people who live or work in that building
9038700 people need to know that the state or local building code is the minimum level of protection allowed by law fortunately there are builders who know how to can and want to build to an even higher safety standard ibhs is proud to work with many of these builders along the gulf coast as part of our fortified for safer living r program
9038701 an unfortunate fact in many areas just inland of the hurricane prone coastline is that homes and businesses have not been built to resist the kinds of strong winds that can occur when a hurricane rips across the coast and pushes inland
9038702 houston pops up as a prime example of this risky proposition while the texas department of insurance high wind standards have been implemented with varying degrees of success in coastal communities houston area homes and businesses have been built with little regard for hurricane winds mother nature frequently misses those memos and a strong storm barreling toward the coast can bring high winds well inland
9038703 we must get serious about spending the extra two percent to three percent it typically requires to properly connect the pieces of our houses together
9038704 louisiana stepped up and has adopted modern building codes throughout their state other states need to do the same until we do widespread but preventable structural damage will continue whenever the winds approach or exceed hurricane force
9038705 if we hope to achieve high quality patient centered care we need interoperable hit that can help us share information electronically and track patients throughout the delivery system all of which can reduce errors and overuse and increase measurement across the continuum of care
9038706 these newly endorsed measures can provide important information on effective use of health it for both early adopters of hit and those who are just beginning to implement hit systems
9038707 nqf endorsed hit structural measures will help the practice of medicine move forward with the adoption of information technology in healthcare
9038708 this allows us to better understand how widely healthcare information technology is being used in care delivery and is a critical first step toward transforming healthcare

9038724 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias
9038725 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground
9038726 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil
9038727 people who know a lot more than i do may be right when they claim that global warming is the consequence of our own behaviour i assume that this is why the bbcs coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago

9038731 seguimos observando que no est n los buses en especial en las ma anas y en las tarde buses que son parte de la flota pero que no salen a la calle adem s los buses que si salen a la calle no muestran la regularidad comprometida en los contratos pasan juntos por los paraderos aumentando los tiempos de espera ya no hay excusas
9038732 porque lo que hemos dicho que quienes no den respuesta a estos requerimiento teniendo las herramientas se enfrentan a la caducidad esta est en los contratos y la caducidad dice que el ministerio tiene las atribuciones para nombrar un administrador provisional y ese administrador provisional tiene que manejar la concesi n hasta que se le entrega a otro que s puede prestar un buen servicio

9038734 lo que buscamos tanto el gobierno como los representantes del sector privado y trabajadores es que efectivamente los procesos de cierre ocurran en los casos en que sean factibles previo a la hora de la ley de manera de garantizar total y absolutamente que las personas puedan retirarse de su lugar de trabajo a las 21 horas
9038735 cerraremos los locales a m s tardar a las 20 horas

9038737 y por favor no concurrir a los puntos de venta despu s de las 18 horas eso es s per importante para nosotros como trabajadores que el consumidor nos ayude a cumplir la ley porque si las personas llegan a ltima hora como buen chileno y nosotros esperamos que sean atendidos se demorar m s la salida de descanso de los trabajadores
9038738 nos sentimos enormemente reconocidos y con una gran responsabilidad con el tremendo respaldo que nos han dado los trabajadores y sobretodo porque es precisamente en aquellos lugares donde se concentran los trabajadores m s golpeados por el modelo salmoneros subcontratados miner a donde nuestra lista ha obtenido un in dito apoyo y eso nos reafirma que estamos haciendo las cosas bien y que hemos estado donde se nos necesita
9038739 ha sido un acto de unidad un acto de democracia con un alt simo nivel de participaci n 70 y eso da cuenta de que ha crecido la confianza en la central y en que los trabajadores podemos ser un actor relevante en la vida nacional significa que los trabajadores respaldan plenamente la estrategia de la movilizaci n de la organizaci n y de la unidad para recuperar nuestros derechos y eso es lo que vamos a hacer

9038766 its not the kind of team you think ok this is i aa its a team we should beat this is a team that has the potential to beat a lot of people
9038767 they can look at the tape and see that theyre a good football team
9038768 their quarterback was a no 1 pick last year and obviously there are people around him that helped him do that
9038769 theres a lot of guys on their team id like to have on my team
9038770 were happy with the verdict but its a shame this should have been limited to one death
9038771 he should have had the courage and the guts to kill himself before killing anyone else
9038772 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work
9038773 he earned this day his actions call out for the death penalty
9038774 i cant speak for shasta i cant get inside her head
9038775 possibly now well have to be dragged through a court proceeding in california if they go ahead with the prosecution it would be such as waste of taxpayer money because hell never spend a day in a california prison
9038776 by the verdict today they have given voice to the victims
9038777 generally for human beings its pretty hard to maintain impartiality when confronted with such horror
9038778 how could any juror not want to see this person removed from our list of living human beings how could you live with yourself as a juror if theres any chance this human being could escape from jail and do something like this again
9038779 the last 3 years and 6 months at radio one have been a life changing experience i thank my spiritual father for the friends that ive met and worked with because ive learned so much and have grown as a person here in atlanta im excited about my future i have a strong team of people helping to take me to new heights and i will continue to make people laugh all over atlanta at events and comedy clubs while serving the community through my foundation positive vibes when i got home today i read a book that said on this day the will of god is done in my life that was all the closure i needed

9038792 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a refinancing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
9038793 even as late as lunchtime today thursday we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
9038794 the aircraft is on the ground in calgary pending resolution with zoom and the leaseholder as well as the creditors

9038807 its one of those things that are more complicated than it seems at first blush said allen fishbein director of housing and credit policy for the consumer federation of america
9038808 consumers have to make sure they understand the credit thoroughly
9038809 breaking the log jam of unsold homes is something we are very much behind
9038810 it will help chip away at inventory levels stabilize prices and spur sales activity
9038811 buyers flocked to market and cleared out a then record inventory of homes
9038812 the 7 500 reserve will make borrowers less likely to fall into default
9038813 its not going to provide first time home buyers with cash up front
9038814 you have to apply to get the credit after the fact theres a delay before you get the financial advantage
9038815 consumers have to have their eyes open about how this works
9038816 given the economy it will only push a precious few first time home buyers over the edge right now
9038817 the challenge right now is as much willingness to buy as affordability
9038818 the market still has this psychological barrier because people think prices will be lower tomorrow i dont think this can overcome that barrier
9038819 my office mates think im a little bit crazy but in many ways part of the reason i do this is to encourage other people to cycle
9038820 the thing we struggled with was whether his personal life was you know his
9038821 i think we all thought that was true on the other hand his position i guess what you do in your personal life does affect the publics perception of what you do on the job
9038822 it wasnt like he killed somebody or stole money so where wed end up court was who knows
9038823 todd and sarah are scratching their heads why on earth hasnt this why is this guy still representing the department hes a horrible recruiting tool you know
9038824 many people said that about her in terms of being governor and i think shes done an excellent job
9038825 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9038826 in this very competitive election for them to go pick somebody who is under a cloud of suspicion who is under investigation for abuse of power it just sounds like a pretty slow start to me
9038827 we need a vice president who can step in if god forbid something happened to john mccain
9038828 i dont think shes someone who is ready for that 3 a m phone call
9038829 gov palin has proven herself as a bright energetic leader for our state and will bring the same energy to the vice presidency she will serve our country with distinction the first alaskan and first woman on the republican ticket i share in the pride of all alaskans
9038830 i think its a great opportunity for the state of alaska
9038831 for us to get our message out in what the satae has to offer to the nation
9038832 a mixed set of emotions kind of an odd sense of alaska nationalism or pride
9038833 this is like watching a moon landing or something its just something you dont expect to see very often its wonderful
9038834 it was an emotional thing to see the governor walk out with her family and i say wow i work for her
9038835 we are going to have a team here next september
9038836 ich glaube bernd anm st rmer bernsteiner der zwei tore schoss hat heute gezeigt dass er ein unangenehmer st rmer ist er ist in seinen bisherigen eins tzen nie belohnt worden und hat heute bewiesen dass ein spieler der noch vor einem jahr in der regionalliga gespielt hat auch auf diesem niveau spielen kann ich w rde mir w nschen dass die mannschaft fters so auftritt wie sie es mir im training zeigt
9038837 die entt uschung ist sehr gro in kapfenberg ist es schwer zu spielen die spielen einen aggressiven fu ball mit vielen langen b llen damit haben wir unsere probleme vor allem in der ersten h lfte hatten wir viele chancen die wir nicht nutzen konnten eine falsche outeinwurf entscheidung gegen und nicht f r uns hat zum 1 0 gef hrt
9038838 wer dieses spiel nicht ernst nimmt bekommt es mit mir zu tun
9038839 mais ce qui se joue ici cest notre opposition et nos propositions

9038841 when certain people throw out ridiculous numbers you know theyre throwing out ridiculous numbers because they want to scare off competition or they want to make themselves seem invincible and that sort of nonsense
9038842 realistically if youre going into this space for the first time and you want to compete with wow and you want to compete with us because were going into that same space youve got to make sure that you have at least 100 million dollars
9038843 in february we honored our 80 year and older members with tell my story where we videotaped each one talking about their life
9038844 in march we hosted a prayer breakfast and this weekend is our musical tribute featuring former daytonian and music minister the rev derek floyd and the ebenezer baptist church mens choir from atlanta
9038845 when i first went to wayman it was exactly what i needed an uplifting experience
9038846 we had young people we had old people people seemed to be more committed to attending church and seemed to rely more on their faith and abide by basic principles nowadays our style of music has become more updated and we still maintain a reasonable crowd of young people
9038847 he is a theologian and a compassionate pastor he is extremely intelligent he doesnt preach with a lot of antics but he gives a meaningful sermon every time hes perfect for our church and perfect for our 175th anniversary celebration
9038848 this isnt a good time i cant do it maybe someday
9038849 a boy like that will kill you brother forget that boy and find another one of your own kind stick to your own kind
9038850 the face of retail in western pennsylvania is going to change forever
9038851 you cant get these stores other than going to washington d c or philadelphia so its huge the entire region will be impacted
9038852 if you walk out of nordstrom youll have on the lower level tiffany and louis vuitton and burberry and bcbg
9038853 no one can buy alitalia in the state its in
9038854 with all respect i am not merlin the magician the business is toast it doesnt exist any more theres nothing left
9038855 the u s dollar tumbled from six month peaks against the euro on wednesday as comments by a european central bank official rekindled speculation about an interest rate increase in the euro zone to quell persistent inflation pressure
9038856 we are going to see much more dramatic drops in output
9038857 the way to get out of it is to act by interest rate cuts and fiscal stimulus and other things to try help people who are hurt through this
9038858 sitting by doing nothing is not going to get us out of this and hoping that a knight in shining armour will come and lift us out of this is optimistic in the extreme
9038859 this is even more stupid than last times a veritable pile of poo
9038860 it is a pail of dung and we cant live with the smell
9038861 it is the container of the excrements and it is very strong such that none may abide by it
9038862 it is a vessel of fertilizer and none may abide its strength
9038863 this new plan will actively promote the growth and vigor of the company with very powerful effects
9038864 i didnt have a clue you could go into 15 000 debt in one night
9038865 when i saw that bill i was just kind of numb
9038866 two thirds of the people who go into medical debt have insurance
9038867 when medical debt hits it hits very quickly its a jolt and its generally not very predictable
9038868 the most dangerous thing people do when they get into debt is ignore the statements and notices
9038869 they think doctors and hospitals wont send them to collection agencies but they absolutely will
9038870 i had a client once who was charged for a surgery she never had
9038871 another one was charged more than 5 000 for disposable gloves
9038872 people think they have to pay the amount on the bill but doctors and hospitals are very willing to negotiate
9038873 she could afford to pay 4 000 so i told her show them a certified check for 4 000 she did and told them this is all i have in the world and they took it
9038874 my whole life ive tried to be smart with money
9038875 now ive had to empty out my 401 k to pay for all this
9038876 dont take a no from the customer service representative on the other end of the 800 number
9038877 i used to run hospitals so i know how these things are priced
9038878 just because a procedure costs 10 000 at one hospital doesnt mean you cant find it for 5 000 down the road
9038879 patients need to learn to be a lot smarter and a lot savvier about their health care
9038880 were hopeful that the storm will miss us but weve got to prepare as if its coming our way
9038881 were well positioned and weve got a good set of plans and now were waiting to put them into motion
9038882 its possible the storm could go as far west as east texas
9038883 it is time for that attitude to be finished in scottish society
9038884 celebrate not just tolerate diversity and distinctiveness within our education system
9038885 alex salmonds administration should take particular care in matters such as these given that the snps biggest donor is a man well known for his conservative views on sexual education in schools the health of s young people is too important to be the subject of any horsetrading
9038886 my advocacy for faith based education extends beyond catholic schools
9038887 ok you dont see his face but you get the idea
9038888 ketchikan desires a better way to reach the airport but the 398 million bridge is not the answer
9038889 despite the work of our congressional delegation we are about 329 million short of full funding for the bridge project and its clear that congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between ketchikan and gravina island
9038890 much of the publics attitude toward alaska bridges is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects here but we need to focus on what we can do rather than fight over what has happened
9038891 an end time army has one common purpose to aggressively take ground for the kingdom of god under the authority of jesus christ the dread champion
9038892 the trumpet is sounding calling on fire revolutionary believers to enlist in joels army many are now ready to be mobilized to establish and advance gods kingdom on earth
9038893 the pitch and intensity of the military rhetoric of this branch of the global dominionist movement has substantially increased since the beginning of 2008
9038894 one can only wonder how long before this transforms into real warfare with actual warriors
9038895 get busy in constructing a bible based social political and religious order which finally denies the religious liberty of the enemies of god
9038896 such leaders prefer more authoritarian structures where their own word or decrees are unchallenged
9038897 everyone born after abortions legalization can consider their birth a personal invitation to take part in this great army
9038898 as the church begins to take on this resolve they joels army churches will start to be thought of more as military bases and they will begin to take on the characteristics of military bases for training equipping and deploying effective spiritual forces
9038899 in time the church will actually be organized more as a military force with an army navy air force etc
9038900 some pastors and leaders who continue to resist this tide of unity will be removed from their place some will become so hardened they will become opposers and resist god to the end
9038901 i am thinking god why is the power of god not moving and he said it is because you havent kicked that women in the face and there was like this older lady worshipping right in front of the platform and the holy spirit spoke to me and the gift of faith came on me he said kick her in the face with your biker boot i inched closer and i went like this makes kicking motion bam and just as my boot made contact with her nose she fell under the power of god
9038902 i believe were headed to an elijah jezebel showdown on the earth not just in america but all over the globe and the main warriors will be the prophets of baal versus the prophets of god and there will be no middle ground
9038903 theres an elijah generation thats going to be the forerunners for the coming of jesus a generation marked not by their niceness but by the intensity of their passion
9038904 the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force such force demands an equal response and jesus is going to make war on everything that hinders love with his eyes blazing fire
9038905 a lot of people die for god and theyre not afraid
9038906 like dawn spreading across the mountains a large and mighty army comes such as never was of old nor ever will be in ages to come
9038907 it is a complete misinterpretation of scripture to find in joels army of locusts a militant victorious force attacking society and a non cooperating church to prepare the earth for christs millennial reign
9038908 through cain came all the smart educated people down to the antediluvian flood the intellectuals bible colleges
9038909 they know all their creeds but know nothing about god
9038910 a super race mentality toward the training of their children
9038911 today you can type joels army into a search engine and a thousand heresy hunter websites pop up decrying the very mention of it
9038912 this battle is not a game they joels army warriors will not be on the defense they will be on the offense and the gates of hell will not be able to hold up against them

9038915 the coaches have said it but they didnt even need to say it thats the first thing we thought about as soon as we knew who we were playing and knew about how drastic if we lost how that could affect our season
9038916 its a game youve got to be pumped up for every game or just like last year itll be one of the biggest upsets like in the michigan appalachian state game you cant overlook anybody
9038917 its a game its the first game the first home game its the season opener no matter who it is what more can you say youve got to be hyped up that were playing ball again
9038918 you never know it might be that one time out of 50 or whatever the odds are that you beat a team like that
9038919 we understand the caliber of team were obviously playing too and we just want to go out and play as well as we can and stay injury free for the most part and get ready for the next week
9038920 its all about us if we do what we need to do against anybody then well play good
9038921 and if we dont do what we need to do then no matter who it is we can be beat
9038922 its never hard to get motivated for any game you take things for granted and something can happen and you get upset thats definitely what we dont want to happen
9038923 we dont want to go out there and look bad our first game of the season its easy to get motivated when you know what youre working for
9038924 we have a high level of respect for georgia southern
9038925 most of their kids are from in state just as ours are we think it will be a pretty heated rivalry a great majority of our georgia guys have high school teammates on their team
9038926 i dont know how theyre going to react if we were playing in front of 92 000 or in front of 4 000
9038927 i just dont know i wish i did i sure would sleep better at night
9038928 is it a good thing its good if we stay there if were there at the end
9038929 i would have to think its a motivating factor for our guys and an excitement factor for our guys to feel like people believe that about our program but its going to be up for judgment every week from this week forward

9038947 some farmers say having a choice of where to sell their grain will give them access to the best spot prices others say they already get the best prices through the board and if the board goes theyll be more vulnerable to the fluctuations of the market
9038948 in august 2007 the cwb responded to various harper initiatives by releasing a vision statement aimed at laying out its future direction entitled harvesting opportunity it stressed the single desk had to remain a key foundation of the agency that was the last time the cwb was able to speak out publicly in favour of the single desk however because on october 11 chuck strahl federal minister for the cwb issued a gag order in the form of an order in council prohibiting the cwb from saying anything that could be construed as advocating for the single desk the unprecedented censorship was followed up less than a week later by a deliberate move on the part of the federal government to rig the cwb board of directors elections which had got underway in the early part of september 2007 strahl sent a directive to the cwb stripping over 16 000 farmers from the voters list after these farmers had already received notice they would automatically be receiving ballots these farmers now had to submit a statutory declaration before they could receive a ballot
9038949 ridiculous in fact i think it is disgraceful that we have marketing choice for barley being blocked by liberal ndp and bloc mps who dont represent any western farmers at all
9038950 the tone and emotional fervor behind harpers response is telling for harper this is an ideological struggle which completely masks the fact that the only thing that protects barley farmers from the global market is the cwb the ndp critic pat martin put it best harpers ideology is that never mind reason never mind logic were going to destroy the canadian wheat board and undermine the single desk monopoly come hell or high water the empirical evidence doesnt matter a hoot but the courts said no they slapped this incredible gag order on them to their credit
9038951 decades of subsidized agriculture dumping by rich countries resulting in stagnant commodity markets and a pervasive agricultural malaise in the developing world
9038952 another inconvenient truth how biofuel policies are deepening poverty and accelerating climate change
9038953 rich countries biofuel policies currently offer neither a safe nor an effective means to tackle climate change by increasing aggregate demand for agricultural land they will drive the expansion of farming into critical carbon sinks such as forests wetlands and grasslands triggering the release of carbon from soil and vegetation that will take decades and in some cases centuries of biofuel production to repay at a time when emissions need to peak and fall within the next 10 to 15 years
9038954 biofuels are also playing a significant role in the food crisis and have been identified as a major culprit by the un world bank and international monetary fund imf the imf estimates that last year they accounted for almost half of the increase in demand for major food crops

9038995 the cast i worked with had no cinematic training which i though would be useful to access things that a professional actor wouldnt be capable
9038996 usually an actor is trained to show things i thought it was important to show what a person was hiding
9038997 right up to the day of shooting i hadnt found a suitable character to play that role and i even thought about cutting her out
9038998 as it is a very masculine and male oriented society the thought of really coming out and revealing that fact they wanted to come out and revealing they are not a real male has real problems all of the women i met who wanted to be male didnt want this to be known for them it was a real problem coming out

9039054 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down shes fought oil companies and party bosses and do nothing bureaucrats and anyone who puts their interests before the people of whom she swore an oath to serve

9039089 weve got to pull together here and make this happen this chase is what its all about you cant win a championship without being in this thing
9039090 all i know about it is that no decision has been made
9039091 i just know they need a driver for the 12 car
9039092 i really dont ask the question about the no 12 too much
9039093 because ive had so much going on around my own deal there hasnt really been any discussion around the shop even from just talking to the guys on the team im not really hearing a lot
9039094 weve had a ton going on trying to get our program straightened out so were not worried a whole lot about that right now
9039095 i really enjoyed working with chris and all the things that we had been able to go through and do this year and getting to know him
9039096 but the team felt it was time for a change
9039097 it was a tough week to do it because you have a short week because you go from running on sunday at michigan to running on saturday night at bristol plus a couple months ago i had asked if i could run the nationwide race there at bristol
9039098 so we didnt have time for all the debriefing and all the things that were going to have this weekend we didnt even have time to go do a test together

9039106 the establishment figure from 2000 had become a lonely maverick in his own right
9039107 you feel bad for the guy if you think about it
9039108 the guy after all who in 2004 helped fund the campaign by the swift boat veterans for truth to discredit john kerry boone is suddenly acting like the greenest of democrats
9039109 p art of the credit for the way mr mccain outperforms his party must go to mr mccain himself
9039110 elegant texts that he stumbles through like a man of homely tastes choking on nouvelle cuisine
9039111 theres a theme that recurs in your books and your speeches both about putting country first but also about honor i wonder if you could define honor for us
9039112 read it in my books ive read your books no im not going to define it but honor in politics i defined it in five books read my books

9039116 born in idaho and raised in alaska palin played on her high schools championship basketball team she was the 1984 runner up in the miss alaska pageant receiving a scholarship that allowed here to attend the university of idaho where she received a degree in journalism after working as a sports reporter at an anchorage television station palin served two terms on the city council from 1992 to 1996 was elected mayor of wasilla in 1996 and ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 2002 after charging ethical violations by state republican party leaders 3 she won election in 2006 by first defeating incumbent governor frank murkowski in the republican primary then former democratic alaskan governor tony knowles in the general election
9039117 if theres a big rain event ambulances may have a problem getting to us
9039118 theyre setting themselves up for a nightmare that area floods way more so than where charity was
9039119 if the streets flood we cant get to them with the things they need
9039120 we have everything in the hospital that we need to run it
9039121 were really focusing on a group of our folks committed to staying in the hospial and working in shifts during the storm
9039122 for 20 years we have been preparing for the perfect storm
9039123 all of our generators are on the third floor or above
9039124 for katrina we had to use a football field at the high school next door to land copters
9039125 we will discharge as many kids a possible before the storm
9039126 im not leaving camerons side i will hunker down with him on storm night
9039127 the hospital has changed a lot of things since katrina the nurses doctors and surgeons nurse have been in direct contact with me letting me know what to expect its really comforting because the cardiac specialty team stays here in the storm and camerons cardiologist and the cardiothoracic surgeon live within walking distance a couple blocks from the hospital
9039128 patients have been calling to find dialysis clinics in the areas they are going to evacuate to
9039129 and believe me i will find a place in this book to get to for dialysis
9039130 they will automatically have my medical records there im not worried about the hurricane honey
9039131 we have a plan in place to assist those patients
9039132 we realize babies have their own timetable and will continue to be born patients suffering with chest pain and possible heart attacks will continue to present to our emergency room and require special procedures
9039133 as a tourism community at this point we are operating business as usual
9039134 in a very sort of counterintuitive way it was a net benefit for the hotels in the area because of storm displacement and temporary housing
9039135 its not the way you want to boost your business but unfortunately its the reality
9039136 when we see something like this happen earlier in the week people will tend to look at other places other destinations that arent going to be affected
9039137 given the flight cutbacks and high load factors you may have a heck of a tough time finding a substitute trip that quickly
9039138 its become the norm that were always looking at potential events or significant weather coming through
9039139 its just become a way of life for us to have the ability to react to situations like this
9039140 with a sunny and clear forecast for the weekend we hope to have a normal labor day as people arrive on friday evening stay through the weekend and depart on monday morning
9039141 fuck my daughters right to choose and let the schools teach her than man and dinosaurs co existed

9039144 misalnya terdapat sebuah kotak di dalamnya kita siapkan labu gas beracun dan palu yang terhubung dengan
9039145 kemudian kita masukkan seekor kucing bersama zat radioaktif yang probabilitas peluruhannya sebesar 50 dalam satu jam
9039146 dengan demikian setelah satu jam kemungkinannya sama yakni gas beracun mengalir kucing
9039147 ini berarti kucing mati sekaligus hidup bagaimana mungkin ini terjadi
9039148 mustahil untuk bisa mengukur secara tepat posisi sekaligus momentum partikel yang bergerak apabila posisinya diketahui maka momentumnya tidak akurat sebaliknya jika momentumnya diketahui maka posisinya lah yang tidak akurat

9039153 her and i make the perfect 10 when we stand next to each other
9039154 i just at the time felt it was the easy way out
9039155 i was so bummed and it was dinner time anyway
9039156 i dont know that i thoroughly enjoyed it but i began to enjoy it
9039157 the guys did a great job building on the progress they made last year by training hard and competing all summer long
9039158 one of our goals is to build a team that plays trains and develops together all year round many of our players did that and our incoming freshmen have impressed us with their commitment to improving their games and getting ready to contribute the moment they arrive on campus
9039159 im hillary clinton and i did not endorse this ad
9039160 the market is just very fragile theres not a lot of support going into the labor day weekend
9039161 the dell news has compounded the downside move when you have a non financial company missing its earnings thats disconcerting to the market
9039162 the u s data contrasts with weaker reports from abroad as the global economy deepens its slowdown
9039163 this is a continuation of the more upbeat sentiment on the u s currency
9039164 we still see no clear trigger for a sustained recovery
9039165 right now there is still uncertainty on where exactly gustav will hit and so it is difficult to determine the damage that the storm might bring
9039166 where would we be if not for the pieces of sheet music left behind by the greats
9039167 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
9039168 there is nothing new here such as to make us hesitate from the course we are taking given the urgency of the situations with which we are dealing and the realities already on the ground
9039169 for the sake of the anglican communion this is an effort to bring order out of the chaos of the present time and to make sure as far as possible that some of the most faithful anglican christians are not lost to the communion
9039170 it is expected that priority will be given to the possible formation of a province in north america for the common cause partnership
9039171 we see ourselves as just an initial grouping open to others
9039172 esteemed colleagues from the global south have strongly commended it to us
9039173 the anglican covenant will take a long time to be widely accepted and may have no particular force when it does the idea of moratoria has never dealt with the underlying problem as is shown by the equivalence of cross border care and protection with the sexual sins which have caused the problems
9039174 i think it is up to the primates to decide how they are going to do things
9039175 i dont think we can be told ahead of time what type of meeting we are going to have or how we are going to talk
9039176 if you wanted to help others why didnt you help them build
9039177 income and welfare centenary article household income and its distribution
9039178 over the course of the twentieth century the australian economy grew at an unprecedented level resulting in rising material prosperity and increasing standards of living although the fruits of growth have not been distributed evenly over time across regions or between sub groups of the population the overall effect has been to raise the average level of economic well being far above what it was when the century began
9039179 when youve got money saturating politics and even if you care deeply about the public good youve got to see where the money is and thats what this is about every four years
9039180 give me your address and well come get you as soon as the storm dies down
9039181 maam we cant send anyone right now were in the middle of a hurricane
9039182 do what you have to do to save your life
9039183 there is no one to come get you eric can you hear me do you understand
9039184 eric can you hear me you have to do whatever it takes to save your own life
9039185 what an unbelievable head fake by mccain perfectly executed to build suspense and knock the one off the front page this morning mind blowing
9039186 if shes the pick the press frenzy will be huge huge but mccain will largely lose the experience issue against obama by any standard governor palin is less prepared as commander in chief than obama
9039187 the announcement from dayton will start any minute theres a new rock star in town conservatives are full of hope that alaska gov sarah palin will bring much needed change to mccain republicanism yes im impressed very impressed
9039188 not one of the movers and shakers in the republican party

9039195 but then i know i am not going to walk on the stage of our new concert hall to welcome people when it finally opens
9039196 the new building can be transformational for the orchestra and for the city
9039197 it really has been a privilege and a joy this was the hardest decision of my life
9039198 when the invitation from dallas came pamela said lets do this even though she loved it here and has been involved with several local organizations she is totally rooted in texas
9039199 the only thing in the world that would pull me away from the cso
9039200 i went there for a visit in may it didnt feel right i thought this is silly
9039201 then i heard some members of the board talk about raising the level of the orchestra i heard verdis requiem with jaap conducting and he just fired everyones imagination
9039202 it was then that i thought this might be something thats right for me it would be intriguing to be part of building an orchestra up i felt a calling there just like i did here
9039203 back then the orchestra had a national reputation of being at risk
9039204 the organization wouldnt be here today without the hard work and dedication of the kerns
9039205 soon after i took the job here i went to an american symphony orchestra league meeting and a guy said with a sneer oh youre from
9039206 six years ago they would have laughed at the thought of holding it here
9039207 but then to sit in boettcher and see their reactions when they heard the orchestra play
9039208 knowing the respect this organization enjoys nationally is very satisfying to me
9039209 some on the board were shocked when i told them and then i had to tell the orchestra ive had a wonderful close relationship with the players just as i had in dallas there was a reaction and some tears but then they said were happy for you
9039210 then at some point im sure they thought oh my gosh what about me musicians are generally nervous types
9039211 i told them look good things are happening and youre ok
9039212 we only have about two or three weeks more of ice melt and its not going to make it to the north pole
9039213 and it is less likely to recover during cool periods
9039214 were continuing to have very low ice years and the chances of setting records are greater now than in the past
9039215 the arctic is more vulnerable to greater ice loss now
9039216 to recover to the ice levels of the 1980s would require many years in a row of cool conditions and that isnt going to happened under global warming conditions
9039217 luego de salir en libertad condicional continu su trabajo musical y las letras de porno para ricardo se volvieron m s cr ticas e irreverentes esto no fue tolerado por las autoridades que comenzaron un largo per odo de acoso policial que finaliz con su actual arresto y pr ximo juicio utilizando la justificaci n de una inexistente peligrosidad ciudadana

9039223 the price discovery mechanism for the futures trading is very flawed today and the spot trading will lead to an efficient price discovery mechanism
9039224 once the spot trading begins and mandis are electronically linked the farmers would know the price of the fruits vegetables or other commodities that they sell across various markets

9039230 this storm has the potential for being a very dangerous storm so we strongly encourage the residents to follow the instructions of the local emergency management officials and be prepared to evacuate
9039231 we are better able to respond to an oil disruption scenario than we ever have before
9039232 the club has made some terrific signings over the summer adding to an already talented pool of players last saturdays win over arsenal shows just how competitive fulham are in the premier league
9039233 this is a crucial stage in my career and im delighted to have committed myself to fulham for what i hope will be my prime years as professional footballer
9039234 dickson fits the profile we were seeking his athleticism strength and brand of football will offer a new dimension to the roster of players we have available in midfield
9039235 who can best help me shake up washington and make it start working again for the sarah palin voting record sarah palin record
9039236 we think there is still a lot of growth potential for the hermes brand which is not yet widely distributed around the world
9039237 given that luxury goods are discretionary expenditure it seems counter intuitive that they are not as affected by the
9039238 geographical diversification tight control of brand development and distribution network pricing power and size are key factors for their success
9039239 the time horizon for a rewarding investment in the luxury sector seems to move forward as forecasts converge to indicate increasing risks of a recession
9039240 their core brands continue to enjoy strong momentum and are set to gain market share at a time when retailers and consumers seek quality and higher intrinsic value
9039241 it has been an on going process since it first took place and i take the charges very seriously
9039242 after reviewing the decisions that were made by the solicitor and clemsons administration reading statements by witnesses including a female witness and taking into account the fact that deandre had no previous disciplinary problems i decided to make this recommendation to athletic director terry don phillips
9039243 coach bowden and i reviewed all the facts we have available from the organizations investigating the case
9039244 coach bowden has done an outstanding job when it comes to discipline of his student athletes we have had hiccups like all programs but by and large he has an outstanding track record in this area accordingly i support coach bowdens recommendation
9039245 my friends and fellow americans i am very pleased and very privileged to introduce to you the next vice president of the united states governor sarah palin of the great state of alaska
9039246 grit and integrity and devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in washington today
9039247 knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for she stands up for what is right and she doesnt tell anyone to sit down shes fought oil companies and party bosses and do nothing bureaucrats and anyone who puts their interests before the people they serve
9039248 i would be honored to serve next to the next president of the united states
9039249 to be chosen is a great challenge i know that it will demand everything i have to give and i promise nothing less
9039250 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9039251 i had promised todd a little surprise for the anniversary present and hopefully he knows that i did deliver
9039252 it turns out that women in america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9039253 a ship in harbor is safe but that is not why a ship is built politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties the people of america expect us to seek public office and to serve for the right reasons
9039254 no leader in america has shown these qualities so clearly or present so clear a threat to business as usual in washington as senator john s mccain
9039255 this is a moment when principles and political independence matter a lot more than just the party line and this is a man who has always been there to serve his country not just his party and this is a moment that requires resolve and toughness and strength of heart in the american president and my running mate is a man who has shown those qualities in the darkest of places and in the service of his country
9039256 im sure shes trying we havent been off the phone for a second
9039257 governor palin has challenged the influence of the big oil companies while fighting for the development of new energy resources she leads a state that matters to every one of us
9039258 in alaska governor palin challenged a corrupt system and passed a landmark ethics reform bill she has actually used her veto and cut budgetary spending she put a stop to the bridge to nowhere that would have cost taxpayers 400 million dollars
9039259 a maverick with a record of reform picks a maverick with a record of reform with this pick john mccain is putting washington on notice theres a shake up coming
9039260 at a time when many republicans are still clinging to pork barrel politics governor palin has quickly become a leader on this issue
9039261 she is a principled reformer who understands how badly wasteful spending has marred the republican brand
9039262 as a reformer and a leader on ethics reform she has been happy to help out in the investigation of this matter because she was never directly involved her sisters former husband was a state trooper and several years ago was suspended from duty after making threats and using a taser on his stepson one of her staff members did talk about this episode with the office of public safety but the governor was not aware of his actions he was wrong to do so and was later suspended for it
9039263 eh lo so ma ti stai scordando un piccolissimo particolare
9039264 we dont need to married to be committed to each other
9039265 the creative challenge is very interesting for us as this area has yet to be developed for its entertainment offers
9039266 we are anxious for asian audiences to discover this cirque du soleil production
9039267 most of these acrobats have never performed in theatre shows before
9039268 they come from world class competitions they come from the olympics so you have to train them to be performers now and clearly that is what makes cirque du soleil the international company that we are we treat our acrobats as performers as artists
9039269 no one has been spared from these criminals who strip wires from utilities vandalize fire hydrants steal manhole covers destroy agricultural equipment remove guardrails the list goes on and on
9039270 you sure you guys want this its only 3 2 alcohol
9039271 nope its been here as long as i can remember
9039272 what would you think if we did have a woman president
9039273 id be fine with that because at least shed be
9039274 bendito sejas tu iahweh nosso deus de eternidade em eternidade

9039277 you taught me so much you made me laugh and yes you even made me cry you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
9039278 work is about more than a paycheck its dignity its respect
9039279 these are not isolated discussions of economic distress among families down on their luck these are common stories among middle class people who worked hard their whole life played by the rules on the promise that their tomorrows would be better than their yesterdays that promise is the promise of america it defines who we are as a people and now its in jeopardy
9039280 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
9039281 when washington doesnt work all its promises seem empty if your hopes have been dashed again and again then its best to stop hoping and settle for what you already know iget it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
9039282 we generally say that 4 is old enough for the parent to bring a kid to a party and then come back when the party is over
9039283 though it may be different if its a cousin or beloved next door neighbor
9039284 les trasmito la forma en que he controlado mi enfermedad deje de comer obvio dulces pan tortilla papas pastas arroz me inscribi en una academia de zumba me result super divertido saliendo del zumba me voy a nadar adem s me desestresa tengo 3 meses con esta rutina he bajado 18 kilos y mis niveles de azucar son menores de 90 antes no podia bajar de 150 por favor cr anme es increible cuando me checo el doctor me dijo que ten a que transmitir esta formula a quien tenga este problema con mucho gusto les transmito mi experiencia
9039285 a governor for just 20 months she was two term mayor of wasilla alaska a town of 6 500 where the biggest issue is controlling growth and the biggest civic worry is whether there will be enough snow for the that palin shreds mccains greatest hope for victory

9039292 to this day my heart breaks as i recall the men who lieutenant commander mccain drove completely insane with his cruel and sadistic behavior the only reason the truth has not come out until now is because we wanted to save face and not admit that a severely injured prisoner totally broke the will of his captors
9039293 when the lieutenant started calling us his friends my name is john sydney mccain iii my friends he would say my rank is lieutenant commander in the u s navy my friends let me tell you my friends about my serial number which is 35 25 39 156
9039294 over and over we tried to explain to him that we werent his friends but his enemies but it never sank in
9039295 a normal work shift in our prisons was eight hours long but most people could handle only 30 minutes in mccains presence
9039296 early on we asked our prize prisoner to make a video telling the world how well he was being treated
9039297 given the counterfeit smile and excruciating references to my friends that were causing acute mental and emotional distress to everyone else in the prison my superiors decided to repatriate mccain as quickly as possible
9039298 the situation became untenable guards were either cracking under the pressure or becoming mutinous pows were threatening mass suicide the international red cross was about to arrive for an inspection visit
9039299 as i explained earlier we put the word out that we were torturing our captives as a way to project strength and avoid international embarrassment
9039300 we understood that militarily we couldnt defeat the americans but there was one area where we had overwhelming superiority patience we could afford to wait wait for as long as it took lieutenant commander john mccain to become president mccain and begin torturing the american public as he did us soon the entire country would become one vast lunatic asylum and victory would finally be ours if that obama fellow doesnt get in the way my friends
9039301 weve made attempts to talk to him and he hasnt been able to communicate with us
9039302 were going by witness accounts that the cars were racing
9039303 and once in a while like in the incident last night we suspect maybe the individuals just started racing each other but theres nothing to make us believe this was a planned race
9039304 i dont think so especially because her sister was going to give birth next month
9039305 i dont think it was racing if anything it was the other two cars and they got in the middle of it
9039306 theres not a lot of cross traffic and you could blow a red light and get going theres a lot of whipping down the street
9039307 markkinoille tulee valtava m r uudenlaisia v h hiilisi tuotteita ja palveluita
9039308 it probably wouldnt be as hip and as cool as the obama underwear
9039309 i could use them as a welcome mat and wipe dog shit off my shoe on his face
9039310 alaska needs to be self sufficient she says instead of relying heavily on federal dollars as the state does today
9039311 i read that she voted against giving partners of gay couples benefits and protection in the workplace

9039352 this incident could have been a lot worse and we want everyone to know how proud we are of frank
9039353 he didnt do anything wrong he saved his own life and the life of our sister and daughter we are very grateful to him for that frank is our familys hero

9039368 the womens sites are a great testament to the fact that women not only control the household dollar but are very active participants online
9039369 they are more than half the internet users and more than half the bloggers it is a womans domain
9039370 are increasingly wanting what they want when they want it from people who seem like themselves what blogging brings to the whole online experience whether research shopping or communication is the ability to see what makes people tick and figure out if theyre someone who you trust
9039371 that was definitely a motivation behind our tone and voice for shine
9039372 one thing we learned in researching what we should do with shine is that women feel they do need a place to congregate theyre tribal on some level they want their own little corner a place to nurture each other and help each other out thats the great thing about a womens site you feel like you have a spot where your problems are everyone elses that your worries the things you like to do like shop and your guilty pleasures are shared by other people who are there
9039373 the aaron game used bat value depends on the amount of use
9039374 a signature does not mean that much on a game used bat if the player is still living it is from late in his career which hurts a bit if it shows nice use it should be worth 3 000 to 4 000 an aaron bat from the 1950s is much rarer and worth 15 000 or more the signature might add 200 to the price
9039375 the 1941 bat given to all players coaches and executives is worth around 800 1 000

9039377 people are going to be tripping over themselves to get to this guy not only is he a phenomenal competitor not only does he have three above average pitches he is one of the greatest teammates a guy can have he is such a phenomenal presence in the clubhouse
9039378 so hopefully those long passes and runs will all go for touchdowns so we dont have to worry about getting up there and getting a play off in time
9039379 our offensive coordinators and coaching staffs like this because in the past youre always at the mercy of each referee being a little different each crew being a little different now were consistent
9039380 the offensive team can come up and snap it with 39 seconds on the clock or they can let it run all the way down to 1 the offensive team determines the pace at which theyre going to operate not the official
9039381 what i told doug is i want to see where are you going to get the ball ready as opposed to when that 40 seconds starts and how much time do i really have
9039382 if were no huddling people i want that ball and i want our team over that ball with 33 seconds am i going to be able to do it can i snap it with 33 seconds can i speed the game up or can i significantly slow the game down with a 40 second clock
9039383 we practice that hustling getting downfield coming back and looking out for somebody to come in for us if were being substituted for
9039384 coach always urges us to get out of the huddle and get to the line fast so it wont be anything to us were accustomed and probably already adapted

9039425 all human communities live out of some story that provides a context for understanding the meaning of history and gives shape and direction to their lives
9039426 if we allow the bible to become fragmented rather than a coherent story it is in danger of being absorbed into whatever other story is shaping our culture and it will thus cease to shape our lives as it should
9039427 the biblical story is a compelling unity on which we may depend and each of us has a place within that story
9039428 we need some sense of the big story of the world before the meaning of any event in our lives makes sense
9039429 individual experiences make sense and acquire meaning only when seen within the context or frame of some story we believe to be the true story of the world
9039430 because of the individualism and consumerism central to the western cultural story divorce is often portrayed as something rather positive
9039431 the basic story assumed in much of modern western culture is humanistic and has its roots in the european enlightenment of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the belief that human reason is the measure of all things and that knowledge is power permeated european society people believed that through science and technology alone and utterly apart from god humankind could build a perfect world it is a false story in stark contradiction to the truth of the biblical story the modern western worldview is not the only such grand story available there is another better and truer way in which to see our world
9039432 to be human means to embrace some such basic story through which we understand our world and chart our course through it this does not mean that individuals are necessarily conscious of the story they are living out of or of the molding effect that such a story has had on their thought and actions for instance many college and university students of our time are living sexually promiscuous lives they may live this way without thinking much about why they do so hence they are not at all likely to see that the story within which such conduct is approved is heavily indebted to jean jacques rousseau sigmund freud and other such thinkers of past centuries their views of marriage and the human person underlie the changes in attitude toward sexuality that took place in the 1960s and onward

9039502 unfortunately many people feel the need to manually remove earwax called cerumen which serves an important protective function for the ear
9039503 cotton swabs and some other home remedies can push cerumen further into the canal potentially foiling the natural removal process and instead cause build up known as impaction
9039504 when cerumen builds to the point of causing symptoms such as pain ringing itching or hearing problems its a sign you should see a physician
9039505 the complications from cerumen impaction can be painful and include infections and hearing loss
9039506 it is hoped that these guidelines will give clinicians the tools they need to spot an issue early and avoid serious outcomes

9039566 she may not be ready for primetime the heartbeat from the presidency issue is a real one
9039567 its a recognition of how vulnerable mccain is despite polls showing its close
9039568 nothing but elation people are giddy they are energized and they now believe that in fact this campaign has the ability to win this election
9039569 absolutely brilliant choice john mccain could not have chosen a better vice presidential nominee that gov palin she is attractive articulate conservative pro family pro life and pro marriage john mccain hit this one out of the ballpark
9039570 those who point out that george h w bush was able to win despite dan quayles presence on the ticket forget that the country was much more solidly republican at the presidential level back then than in todays 50 50 america
9039571 two senior republican officials close to mitt romney and tim pawlenty said they had both been rudely strung along and now feel manipulated
9039572 they now know that they were used as decoys well after mccain had decided not to pick them
9039573 she has thrilled the gops conservative base which can now in good conscience give itself to the mccain candidacy with enthusiasm not feigned enthusiasm real enthusiasm for the first time since the senator entered the race this has solved mccains worst strategic problem
9039574 with our system we were able to pick it up with relatively small numbers otherwise it might have gone unnoticed
9039575 it helped us to connect the dots in such a way that we were able to say we have something provincially going on
9039576 i was disappointed that the judges didnt call out more of those where it was like this was obviously made from a car there were certain ones where its like how can you call me off and say that mine doesnt look cohesive when you have other ones where its like did you make that in the dark because that fits so poorly
9039577 honestly if i could dig a little bit deeper inside myself and stay inspired because at that point i was no longer inspired to do the show and there are a dozen things that ive thought of that i would do differently i would create an innovative intricate piece i mean thats what i do im a conceptual designer

9039581 obamas was a deeply substantive speech full of policy detail full of people other than the candidate centered overwhelmingly on domestic economic anxiety
9039582 it was a liberal speech more unabashedly unashamedly liberal than any democratic acceptance speech since the great era of american liberalism
9039583 his ability to portray that liberalism as a patriotic unifying ennobling tradition makes him the most lethal and remarkable democratic figure since john f kennedy
9039584 what he didnt do was give an airy abstract dreamy confection of rhetoric the mccain campaign set obama up as a celebrity airhead a paris hilton of wealth and elitism and he let them portray him that way and let them over reach and let them punch him again and again and then he turned around and destroyed them if the rove republicans thought they were playing with a patsy they just got a reality check
9039585 tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
9039586 because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
9039587 better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9039588 if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from you make big elections about small things
9039589 it was a historic speech on a historic night in a remarkable setting
9039590 never in the nations history had more americans attended such an event never before had an african american accepted the presidential nomination of a major party in the united states and the speech of barack obama matched the moment
9039591 he connected his own history the history of a not quite ordinary american family to the mythical promise of america
9039592 obama laced his criticism of the bush years and the possible mccain years with a dose of populism which gave portions of the speech a sharp edge and he brought his pitch for hope and change down to the ground with a succinct description of policy ideas he would work for as president
9039593 obamas was a deeply substantive speech full of policy detail full of people other than the candidate centered overwhelmingly on domestic economic anxiety
9039594 it was a liberal speech more unabashedly unashamedly liberal than any democratic acceptance speech since the great era of american liberalism
9039595 his ability to portray that liberalism as a patriotic unifying ennobling tradition makes him the most lethal and remarkable democratic figure since john f kennedy
9039596 what he didnt do was give an airy abstract dreamy confection of rhetoric the mccain campaign set obama up as a celebrity airhead a paris hilton of wealth and elitism and he let them portray him that way and let them over reach and let them punch him again and again and then he turned around and destroyed them if the rove republicans thought they were playing with a patsy they just got a reality check
9039597 the 5 0 thing puts a lot more extra pressure on us as it would take us up to second in the world rankings
9039598 that is the kind of pressure we want pressure is a privilege and if we win 5 0 it takes us right up to the top it is something we have talked about and if we deliver we can win 5 0 the dressing room is very happy place
9039599 we are putting pressure on their batters and playing to our potential were hitting their good balls for four and doing a really good job on them
9039600 i know south africa really well and they wanted to beat us they are very proud people and stubborn people
9039601 the cricket we are playing is not good cricket but england are playing unbelievable cricket they are one of the best one day sides we have played against recently
9039602 it has always been a dream to play for england as an individual you couldnt ask for more i played against south africa for the lions and although it was always going to be tough they knew i could bat
9039603 his recent form with the bat is another triumph for new captain kevin pietersen who has promoted the all rounder up the order and persuaded steve harmison a crucial figure in this series out of one day international retirement
9039604 it was a good way to finish the series but the indians played well and deserved to win it
9039605 credit goes to the boys for the way we came back we kept making mistakes through the series we were not consistent in the batting department
9039606 it was good to win the series with a game to spare
9039607 these tracks are said to be slow but the bounce has improved over the last few years i am happy with the way our batsmen have played the spin it was important to keep the strike rotating and our batsmen did that well
9039608 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9039609 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9039610 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9039611 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9039612 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9039613 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency
9039614 am i brushing beacuse i want to or because i have too

9039618 let me say to the people of mississippi this is not a time to panic but it is a time to get prepared
9039619 weve got a bunch of animals and we cant just up and leave them

9039636 shes a fairly articulate spokesperson for the pro drilling view that will provide an interesting contrast to the opposition
9039637 shes taken the ethical high ground and distanced herself from veco
9039638 she also has attempted to reverse the course established by the murkowski administration which was one where the administration directly negotiated with the oil industry in secret
9039639 gov palin certainly showed leadership on the gas line if sen mccain happens to be elected as president that would put a strong representative in the administration in washington thats in favor of an alaska gas line
9039640 were not even validating such an outrageous and preposterous claim with a comment

9039645 but my question to the minister is does it make more sense to have five dangerous people out on the street right now or would we have been better off to have some people brought in and do the proper searching

9039655 we hope that reason will prevail over emotions that eu leaders will find the courage to refrain from a one sided assessment of the conflict
9039656 if european states want to serve the foreign policy interests of the usa then in my opinion they will gain nothing from this
9039657 theyve been saying loud and clear that they feel they could do whatever they want with impunity
9039658 there were safe they were alert now weve had the medical evaluation and they dont even have hypothermia so this is a blessed day

9039687 if we hope to achieve high quality patient centered care we need interoperable hit that can help us share information electronically and track patients throughout the delivery system all of which can reduce errors and overuse and increase measurement across the continuum of care
9039688 these newly endorsed measures can provide important information on effective use of health it for both early adopters of hit and those who are just beginning to implement hit systems
9039689 nqf endorsed hit structural measures will help the practice of medicine move forward with the adoption of information technology in healthcare
9039690 this allows us to better understand how widely healthcare information technology is being used in care delivery and is a critical first step toward transforming healthcare

9039773 i know that everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon because of oil prices
9039774 i don t buy that because i can name two dozen airlines that have gone bankrupt in canada when oil was 20

9039777 for a long time we thought it was our own private business how we feed ourselves but now we understand there are consequences
9039778 a lot of people dont like to cook they like to nuke
9039779 we do live in a society where our time is so valuable that we dont sit and enjoy meals like our forefathers did
9039780 the farm bill is making very very few people successful the vast majority are hurting
9039781 the big commodity regions of the country are becoming poorer and poorer we have to reverse that
9039782 energy health care climate change you cannot make progress on those three issues without addressing food

9039791 there is no technical reason that a third party could not accumulate and assemble the hardware components in an apple labeled computer hardware system such that said system would be capable of running the mac os
9039792 the kernel panic is self induced by apples embedding of code to prevent operability on computer hardware systems that are not apple labeled computer hardware systems
9039793 the mac os market is distinct and unique as compared to other operating systems including but not limited to the windows operating system
9039794 as such psystar alleges that the windows operating system is not and cannot be considered an effective substitute for the mac os the same holds true for any other operating system
9039795 apple is free to control and charge customers supra competitive prices
9039796 apple has at the least substantially lessened competition in the mac os capable computer hardware systems marketplace if not eliminated it in its entirety and as a result maintains its monopoly position with respect to the mac os and the artificially created apple labeled computer hardware system
9039797 smoking bans in a home rule state how do we regulate tobacco in a way that makes sense in kansas
9039798 our goal with this study was to find out the opinions of leaders in cities across kansas regarding smoking bans because no such survey had been conducted yet
9039799 our findings provide evidence that community leaders want to see a smoking ban implemented either at the local or state level
9039800 decision makers need good information in order to make good policies
9039801 we hope that this survey and todays discussion at the symposium will help state policymakers as they decide how best to protect the health of kansans

9039816 second we look within countries and you ask where do we see the inequalities everywhere and the important thing about our report is that pointed not only to the difference between people at the bottom and people everywhere else but the fact that people in the middle have worse health than the people at the top but better health than those at the bottom it runs right across the whole of society
9039817 a changing environment will affect alaska more than any other state because of our location
9039818 in the direct sense vice presidents dont have much to do with what goes on in classrooms but a person whos a creationist doesnt understand science and technology at all
9039819 it doesnt bode well for science and doesnt bode well for interaction between science and government
9039820 i think its a mistake to try to cloud the teachings of science with theories that frankly dont hold up to scientific inquiry
9039821 the following problem is a quite fundamental problem in robotics robots that are better at following could be easier for people to work with

9039824 important the ansi c libraries are not part of the palm development platform in many cases you can perform the same function using a palm os api call as you can with a call to a ansi c function for example the palm os provides a string manager that performs many of the string functions youd expect to be able to perform in an ansi c program if you do use a standard c function the code for the function is linked into your application and results in a bigger executable

9039826 palm os port contains code from the sdl gpl project c such and such
9039827 thus the court recognized the important issue that will need to be resolved in a case interpreting the gpl whether a program linked to gpld software can be considered a derivative work of that software the court also raised the question of whether subsequent shipping of source code can cure a breach of the gpl without permission to continue shipment from either the author or subsequent distributor of the software

9039834 thats the nforce 200 been the only solution and thats been a very very high end solution

9039837 thats a very good question and i guess my guess is that perhaps the line inside the mccain campaign would be if it were a man being picked who also had a baby but you know four months ago with downs syndrome would you ask the same question

9039872 we owe this attitude of reverence and therfore of piety toward all our rulers in the highest degree whatever they may be like therefore if we are cruelly tormented by a savage prince if we are greedily despoiled by one is avaricious or wanton if we are neglected by a slothful one if finally we are vexed for pietys sake by one who is impious and sacrilegious let us first be mindful of our own misdeeds which without doubt are chastiesed by such whips of the lord
