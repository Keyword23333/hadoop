9110014 i cant put into words how tough the past year was
9110015 it got to the point where giving up was harder than trying you know what im saying
9110016 when you continuously fight and continuously fight you get accustomed to doing it
9110017 honestly speaking i cant put into words how tough it was
9110018 i was talking to my mother a while back and i said at times mom this is so tough that i would never repeat my thoughts i would never come out and say it express it to anyone i would keep it to myself because knowing that in a day or two i will feel better things are tough now but eventually the sun will shine
9110019 a 15 yard penalty is going to be worth that if they could take players out my anger was that there was no call
9110020 i would be like where am i trying to go
9110021 i could tell he was in pain and confused and scared he didnt seem like a different person but when talking he would ask some of the same questions and i knew i was repeating things that would be just scary because i knew he wasnt remembering
9110022 i was just concerned that if he got hit really hard again the symptoms would manifest itself again
9110023 really questioned it at that point you are more concerned about his health
9110024 i would be mentally able to comprehend everything that is necessary in order to be a quarterback
9110025 coach could have said he was moving on if coach didnt grant him another year jordan wasnt sure what he would do jordan was a different person after the meeting it took a lot of weight off his shoulders
9110026 they told me i was going to a contending team and that made it a little easier to accept than if i was going to a team that was out of the race that would have been different
9110027 i feel very confident that were going to have the best group out there that will give us a chance to win
9110028 we will focus in and zero in on some of the things that we really want to do now i feel like were in the beginning stages of being able to put our best foot forward with our absolute best group that we could put out on the field
9110029 he stepped in and played right tackle which is what he did when jon was injured last season and he shored things up for us over there thats going to be a battle thats a very close battle now that stephon is playing he has a chance to play some this year
9110030 im not giving up on jon jansen hes been a great part of this offense but were just evaluating and i thought stephon came in and did a good job
9110031 it really is taking that area that we had in the northwest and trying to make sure it fits here in this space and so far its been a pretty good fit
9110032 i dont get upset because i have answered this question many times theres no need to explain anymore
9110033 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9110034 it just felt normal just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole another on the second hole i just kind of built on that momentum
9110035 i just tried to keep the pedal down because i knew the scores were pretty low

9110044 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9110045 thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9110046 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling i particularly look forward to the biden palin debate in missouri

9110073 the skill set you need in terms of the coordination and balance and things like that you cannot choose to drink and ride its just the wrong choice to make
9110074 our vision is really toward zero deaths everyone counts so were not exactly celebrating these numbers
9110075 age 21 drinking laws have been proven time and again effective in preventing deaths and injuries
9110076 and we owe usda a considerable degree of deference in its interpretation of the term
9110077 barack obama will secure america at home and restore our reputation abroad and john mccain will only extend the failed policies of george bush
9110078 stop telling us here about how the use of force doesnt make sense
9110079 the use of force in afghanistan is justified and necessary in darfur justified and necessary in the balkans justified and necessary you guys can have your happy talk theres real life
9110080 a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
9110081 as long as saddams at the helm there is no reasonable prospect you or any other inspector is ever going to be able to guarantee that we have rooted out root and branch the entirety of saddams program relative to weapons of mass destruction
9110082 the only way were going to get rid of saddam hussein is were going to end up having to start it alone
9110083 one thing is clear these weapons must be dislodged from saddam or saddam must be dislodged from power if we wait for the danger from saddam to become clear it could be too late
9110084 did not snub the u n or our allies he did not dismiss a new inspection regime he did not ignore the congress at each pivotal moment he has chosen a course of moderation and deliberation
9110085 i do not believe this is a rush to war i believe it is a march to peace and security i believe that failure to overwhelmingly support this resolution is likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur
9110086 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after
9110087 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others
9110088 we need more troops but not many a single brigade would make an enormous difference the real need is for the right kind of troops we desperately need more special operations forces more civil affairs and intelligence specialists more foreign area officers we also need more hardware more fixed wing aircraft and helicopters for mobility more surveillance drones more satellite tasking more armored vehicles for troop protection
9110089 we should be willing to spend more if we get better returns and less if we dont
9110090 but we have time iran is years away from having a bomb and a missile to deliver it we need to use the time wisely
9110091 we need a policy that isolates iran not america and tips the balance in iran against pursuing nuclear weapons that means keeping our allies russia and china on the same page as we ratchet up economic and diplomatic pressure on the government to stop pursuing nuclear weapons at the same time there are growing fissures within the ruling elite we need to exploit them force must be the last option because its a bad option first with our forces bogged down in iraq our threat to use force doesnt look very credible second we can set back irans program but not stop it using force would lead to retaliation by iran including against our troops in iraq it would cause the iranian people to rally behind ahmadinejad and the extremists third even a limited strike would be perceived as something much bigger by the iranians and could spark a real war
9110092 palestinians will have to yield on the right of return to israel which would destroy the jewish nature of the state
9110093 i am a zionist you dont have to be a jew to be a zionist
9110094 imagine our circumstance in the world were there no israel how many battleships would there be how many troops would be stationed
9110095 it remains my conviction that we should extend an offer of nato membership to any country that applies and meets the criteria
9110096 when congress reconvenes i intend to work with the administration to seek congressional approval for 1 billion in emergency assistance for georgia
9110097 theyre not some politician telling you feeding you shit theyve actually been there theyve experienced it these are the people that we need to be listening to these veterans have a message for you today and they need you to help them take their message to the politicians at the pepsi center so we need to take all this energy and we need to march we need to make it nonviolent and passionate we need to do it with dignity we need to support iraq veterans against the war
9110098 a time comes when the operation of the machine becomes so odious makes you so sick at heart that you cant take part you cant even passively take part and youve got to put your body on the gears upon the levers upon the whole apparatus and youve gotta make it stop and youve gotta let those operating know that unless youre free the operation will be prevented from working at all
9110099 the police in denver have been exceptional and very very supportive

9110102 people were responding in unison in the middle leah daughtry a pastor and ceo of the democratic national convention committee spoke and said that despite what the media says democrats are people of faith

9110104 im not a career protester i just dont like religion mixed with politics its wrong and its dangerous

9110107 at 103 years of age ken usurped our rightful place against the youtube champ
9110108 our sincerest hope is that ken whips kimbo and then we can finally euthanize the worlds most dangerous man and relegate him to some mma dinosaur exhibit
9110109 maybe taxidermy him and dan severn and place them on a rotating pedestal where they can endless circle each other
9110110 if ken proves to be more sham than rock and fergi beats him then the slice hype grows even greater
9110111 dude is already more myth than sasquatch chupacabra and a expletive unicorn combined kevin is the black yeti
9110112 so go ahead and make us wait while you fight tank abbott and shamrock hell why not fight keith hackney harold howard fred ettish and the rest of jurassic mma
9110113 it is not about being scared to fight diaz who i previously defeated it is about the fight i am currently in with elite xc regarding my career
9110114 elite xc creates a new weight class for diaz because he beat gomi giving diaz a belt and creating a weight division 160 he can make will make your belt legit sorry to ruin elite xcs plans and beat him
9110115 elite xc offered me a fight on the first cbs show but only if i signed a new long term contract instead of promoting their best fighters on cbs you have to be on a long term contract for them to promote you
9110116 i am tired of being bent over by elite xc with no vaseline
9110117 turns out some gay ass wrestling federation tna threatened to sue ufc because they recently named one of their wrestlers the war machine rhino and trademarked the name
9110118 too expletive bad that i have been using this name for 6 years have it tatted on my body and it is what my fans yell out when im fighting
9110119 if you know my personality then you know damn well i am not gonna let some expletive ass fake wrestler steal my name
9110120 so 6 weeks ago i filed a change of name request and today i had court to make my name officially war machine lol expletive funny right didnt really wanna have to do it but i am sure as hell not lose my nickname
9110121 i thought i heard the voice of god telling me to go save brian
9110122 i felt if i didnt get to brian he would die
9110123 i get the same amount of money if i fight for a title than if i fight joe stevenson or wayne weems from season five of the ultimate fighter
9110124 sure theres more prestige or whatever with the title but as far as making money in boxing you want the title fight because that guarantees you the big money
9110125 in the ufc your contact really stays the same the prestige comes with winning the belt not the motivation of the money
9110126 i assume after this then ill be fighting for the title but again im not sure ive learned to take it one fight at a time and any promises that are made can change very quickly
9110127 as part of his contract he goes out and i dont know something to do with his contract but hes still got his foot in the door with his contract as part of our business practice in this crazy world these days we let me think how i can word this to you
9110128 i always say we make this thing look a lot easier than it really is and were definitely not going to make it easy for anybody else were going to make things tough for other people
9110129 hes a known commodity and so is kimbo that makes for a spectacular event
9110130 we reviewed all the medical records and spoke with the victims physician and the evidence showed that the loss of the fetus was not related to the crash
9110131 im trying to get away and think about something else and chucks beating up this black dude im like damn
9110132 i figured because i held the title for so long i would be getting a title shot after i beat silva but for whatever reason it didnt work out that way
9110133 ah yea i heard that the american jake shields is saying aoki ran what the hell are you a feudal lord if you were some kinda genius like michael jackson maybe id pay you some mind but you you cant say that
9110134 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it

9110164 what i want to say to my democratic friends in congress is that they need to be very cautious not to seek political advantage by making incendiary suggestions as were made by some today that the white house had advanced information that would have prevented the tragic attacks
9110165 nevertheless fbi information since that time indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks including recent surveillance of federal buildings in new york the fbi is conducting approximately 70 full field investigations throughout the u s that it considers bin laden related cia and the fbi are investigating a call to our embassy in the uae in may saying that a group or bin laden supporters was in the u s planning attacks with explosives outragous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of sept the 11th malicious lies that attempt to shift the blame away from the terrorist themselves away from the guilty

9110219 one guy has never won a world series for you a season series it takes 25 people
9110220 i think theres always a ton of focus on him but theres a ton of focus on him because hes expected to be great every day
9110221 may there be some kinks in it early on possibly but to me i think its the right decision
9110222 it may take a little bit longer in the beginning than we want but im sure it will get ironed out and eventually it will go really quickly
9110223 its a lot of work to come back from what he came back from
9110224 interesting very interesting at times trying the last four years have been a very poor part of my career
9110225 its easier for me to turn the page than think about what couldve been
9110226 we had the pen the way we wanted it and he had done his job
9110227 theyre a young fastball hitting team and im a young fastball pitcher
9110228 when im throwing fastballs i need to execute them for whatever reason against them i havent executed pitches thats the bottom line i left some pitches up and they made me pay for it
9110229 there are exceptions to every rule as long as hes feeling healthy i dont have those kind of fears
9110230 last year when id go out there and throw five innings and throw 100 pitches its hard to do that its very stressful when youre doing that
9110231 youre having to grind through it so its very tough when you go out there and throw 100 pitches in eight innings its a lot easier and a lot less stressful
9110232 this is the time of year you want to be playing your best baseball anyway the last couple of months
9110233 one thing about the american league that i see this year is i think its pretty rich in pitching whether youre playing better teams or one of the teams at the bottom if their starting pitcher is on that night it could be a tough game
9110234 yeah but you could run into an opponent thats under 500 and their pitcher can be on that night and all of a sudden it becomes an extremely tough opponent i know the bottom line is we have to win you just have to worry about winning that night because if you start looking ahead or you start looking at okay were so many games back we have to make up three in one week you never know which week that youre going to make up a lot of games
9110235 you know i feel fine theres nothing thats holding me back as far as strength wise or anything like that weve got one more test again saturday and i think that hopefully will be the last one before we can get in a game
9110236 we couldnt necessarily bring him back as a starter if we activated him right away just because hes not built up
9110237 im not going to get beyond tomorrow and sunday on how he feels obviously i would have loved to have him back three weeks ago but thats not the case
9110238 we had to deal with an injury and hes been feeling pretty good obviously we all feel pretty good about that
9110239 the one thing that weve done we have not rushed this and weve not tried to get ahead of ourselves
9110240 after tomorrows performance well make an evaluation to see if the next step is he needs more time or possibly we could activate him or whatever we need to do like i said were not going to rush it were just going to see how he does tomorrow and how he feels
9110241 its hard to not be in battle with these guys every day
9110242 you spend so much time to be with them to get to where you want to be its frustrating to not be out there fighting with them and battling
9110243 im trying to get better and get back with them but its frustrating not to be with them
9110244 we didnt score early but we scored when the team needed it the most
9110245 i was thinking i just need to come through right here and at least tie the game
9110246 i knew it was going to be gone and i was happy because this is a team we really need to beat
9110247 theyre playing good baseball and i screwed it up my last few outings have been horrible
9110248 we keep the team in the game because we understand we have a really good offense
9110249 we have to keep playing hard every game counts right now
9110250 the mentality right now is that we cant take anything for granted
9110251 it doesnt matter how far behind we are in the game if we put our effort in we can come back and thats what we did
9110252 that was a big win for us because we appeared lethargic
9110253 we didnt appear to be in a fighting mood offensively i think we should have been a little better
9110254 reflecting on the past doesnt do me any good or the team
9110255 to tell you the truth its just as easy for me to turn the page what it could have been doesnt really matter
9110256 i never look at the past i look at what can he do for us over the next six weeks hes 2 0 for us thats a pretty good start
9110257 i asked for six innings and i got everything i asked for
9110258 we had the bullpen how we wanted it and he did his job
9110259 i walked off the mound thinking that was a big out i was pretty locked in
9110260 the lincoln study body was pretty isolated on campus back then so the weekends with football games were an event
9110261 students planned their entire week around the social aspects of the games

9110268 the commerzbank board would not hold negotiations that it did not think it could finance
9110269 but the kids kept battling we came out aggressive in the second half which we didnt do in the first half and made some things happen
9110270 we had zero snaps experience at quarterback coming into the season so im glad derrick came in and had a good half
9110271 it is a populist budget to deflect the growing popularity of anwar
9110272 this has been the major source of racial disharmony so to speak this feeling of alienation and marginalisation appears to permeate among all racial and religious groups particularly since the 1980s this is a dangerous trend that has to be arrested
9110273 umno mca and mic are seen as being more concerned with their own separate racial interests and political progress and survival than the welfare of the masses regardless of race
9110274 some of our leaders use religion to divide and rule race and religion can go hand in hand but our leaders must stand for all and promote better religious harmony not all do and that is the sad thing
9110275 the outcome of the last general election should not be seen as a demise of ethno religious politics it is still very much alive racial politics has helped to embed racism in our subconscious mind

9110342 we didnt score early but we scored when the team needed it the most
9110343 i was thinking i just need to come through right here and at least tie the game
9110344 i knew it was going to be gone and i was happy because this is a team we really need to beat
9110345 theyre playing good baseball and i screwed it up my last few outings have been horrible
9110346 the people of crete are all liars cruel animals and lazy gluttons
9110347 decided were not going to do a pc version this time around
9110348 you see their all alone here so i always keep them with company
9110349 oh i have alot of friends all the animals are my friends and they are much nicer than other persons i know
9110350 i can be your friend if you want to we can go watching the birds everyday
9110351 but i need to know you class and your name though
9110352 oh shure i am jake from 8th grade you are tyler you started in our class today
9110353 oh did you hear it i know its bad you dont need to say it but it calmes the animals so i sing just for them
9110354 i think it was beautiful jake i have never heard anything as beautiful as it before
9110355 its true you are the best singer ive heard ever
9110356 please dont lie to me tyler im fine as it is
9110357 ive never been as honest before and i promise you are an amazing singer
9110358 but everyone i have spoke with said that i suck at singing and and
9110359 i dont know what they did to you but whatever they said was wrong and i will never let them do it again you are now my friend and i will never forgive anyone who does anything bad to you
9110360 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person whos the ideal beauty of the moment
9110361 the work is assembled from our collection of naturally mummified animal parts tiny little creatures teased and tortured by our feral farmyard cat that when assembled will cast a shadow of our profiles onto the walls of the ancient egyptian galleries
9110362 perhaps because the british museum is often celebrated as a museum of antiquities it is not always realised that its collections also include a broad range of contemporary works from around the world ever since its foundation in 1753 the museum has acquired modern material alongside objects from ancient times and this exhibition is a demonstration of the power of this duality
9110363 the british museum is a laboratory of possibility for any creative mind it is filled with objects that reach across time and touch us intimately seeing as a child the great head of rameses and the assyrian winged bulls at the bm was what made me become a sculptor
9110364 we are delighted to sponsor this unique exhibition to mark the broadcast of the sculpture diaries series our ongoing partnership with the british museum is a great inspiration to our work

9110366 my wife and i just got back from 3 weeks in thailand and found your backpacks to both of good design and good quality and would gladly recommend them to anyone regards bob

9110368 usually when a pastor gets that call something bad happened
9110369 at first i sat there stunned very much in disbelief
9110370 hey look we dont endorse gambling gambling is a bad way to finance a church i said we havent done any gambling we received a donation when i said that everyone laughed
9110371 oh yeah the church would have got some money but my wife would have never let me do that
9110372 i know for certain p and p cabinets influential planning and priorities committee was told last week
9110373 they had a political discussion and during that political discussion they concluded that all things being equal they would like to go before the eighth
9110374 obviously at that point there were some outstanding issues how to respond to the opposition leaders but it was agreed that they would go before the eighth if at all possible and this fall for sure
9110375 all those factors outweighed the grief they were going to take for breaking their own legislation
9110376 if you let the by elections take place and you do super well in the by elections then it looks like you are an opportunist if you dont do so well as people expect in the by elections you look like the momentum has gone
9110377 and if youre determined to go it looks like this is what you do
9110378 its trademark harper in that hes making an unexpected decision and once he makes it hes going to pursue it full steam ahead and take the gamble
9110379 this is what he lives for this sort of high stakes politics this is what galvanizes him really gets him excited this is when hes at his best
9110380 youd rather have control of events yourself rather than waiting for other people to act
9110381 this allows harper to control the timing rather than sit passively and wait for dion to make up his mind
9110382 harper cares about senate reform and senate reform is the one issue where this parliament hasnt made any progress on the governments agenda
9110383 he always told me that he wanted to keep governing and he thought he gained by governing demonstrating being able to govern and i think he was sincere in that for a couple of years
9110384 but parliament has become such a circus that just being part of it isnt really helping him much any more its so degrading all the stuff that is happening i dont think it bolsters him any longer i think the situation has changed
9110385 that created the consensus certainly within the pmo where it suddenly dawned on us okay were going to go in the fall
9110386 when it was clear that we were not going to survive until october 2009 if the opposition had their way then it was just a matter of who should control the timing should it be us or should it be them
9110387 you know hes ahead of us hes plotting it out
9110388 oh i have to know what gt the temperature is before i dare to crack the window to see how hot gt or cold it is
9110389 oh i have to know what gt gt the temperature is before i dare to crack the window to see how hot gt gt or cold it is
9110390 oh i have to know what gt gt gt the temperature is before i dare to crack the window to see how hot gt gt gt or cold it is
9110391 oh i have to know what gt gt gt gt the temperature is before i dare to crack the window to see how hot gt gt gt gt or cold it is
9110392 oh i have to know what gt gt gt gt gt the temperature is before i dare to crack the window to see how hot gt gt gt gt gt or cold it is
9110393 oh i have to know gt gt gt gt gt gt what gt gt gt gt gt gt the temperature is before i dare to crack the window to see how hot gt gt gt gt gt gt or cold it is

9110397 theres rocknroll behaviour and theres out of control and i think shes out of control thats when you need some intervention
9110398 to investigate the circumstances and events surrounding the termination of former public safety commissioner monegan and potential abuses of power and or improper actions by members of the executive branch
9110399 i think it raises the profile but it doesnt really change the mission or the work
9110400 i dont think you can avoid finding out what he did but thats not the focus of the investigation
9110401 one branch of government is interested in whether another branch of government broke the law
9110402 ive said all along you could come up with dust you come up with no evidence of wrongdoing or you could come up with clear evidence of wrong doing and it might be by the governor it might be somebody else

9110416 this storm has the potential for being a very dangerous storm
9110417 i do not want to speculate but i am fearful that we could be looking at a number in the region of 10 in terms of the number of people who have died
9110418 last time team officials called me up and said were going out to oakland for a week pack up a weeks worth of clothes
9110419 so i pack up some clothes and get out to oakland and look on tv and every thing i own is under water
9110420 weve all had time to put together a clear plan as to how it affects the organization the team the families of the team
9110421 i dont want to go into detail as to what we do because what we do is really predicated on when its supposed to arrive
9110422 we will be focused and ready to play the buccaneers
9110423 were planning on that game being at the superdome but the powers that be will have a clear plan in place if that should change any or if our preparation should have to be somewhere else it wont be a distraction we wont allow it to be
9110424 that first game that right there ill never forget that
9110425 even though we didnt make it to the super bowl that year that was my super bowl i never seen anything like that and i was just happy to see people out in the streets just happy to see the saints play that day thats probably one thing ill always remember about new orleans is that day
9110426 there are some areas where it looks like it happened yesterday
9110427 those are houses people used to live in and theyre not living there any more so where are they
9110428 i felt like we were all kind of in this thing together
9110429 im trying to rebuild my career coming off the injury and changing teams kind of a fresh start for me a fresh start for the organization and a fresh start for the city
9110430 the more you talk to people and the more you drive around i think you just feel like life is back
9110431 when the storm happened your mind set had to be were going to make things better than they were before were going to try to turn this into a positive somehow some way i see that happening in a lot of areas so just to kind of be there and just feel like youre kind of a part of the rebuilding process is rewarding
9110432 were taking the storm very seriously thankfully so are the leaders of the states that could be impacted
9110433 as you recall in katrina one of the challenges was how do you take people out of hospital after the storm has gone by i would say that louisiana is leaning forward more aggressively on this than other states are right now in part because theyve got katrina on their minds
9110434 there were several hundred thousand households evacuated with katrina and this storm has gone much in the same direction
9110435 you dont tug on supermans cape you dont spit into the wind
9110436 its a bird its a plane naw expletive its the expletive game
9110437 the colonization of american government will only end with creation of a real fifty state democracy in the u s a which could help bring about a real one state democracy in palestine unfortunately anything less will mean much more pain and suffering possibly of epic proportions and not only in palestine and not only for jews
9110438 i think this is the best thing to happen to the lpga the sponsors are correct if im going to sponsor a ladies golf tournament in america then the ladies should be able to speak english and also my thoughts are that the men on the pga in america should speak english as that is where they are making the majority of their living when i go into another country i try to speak enough of the language to get by and im not there to make a living from their money english should be the language in all american sports
9110439 i speak english and i know that the number of phrases and words used during a round of golf with a bunch of guys is pretty limited and for the female golfers even more limited because they wouldnt be expected to comment on the beer cart girl or tell bad really old jokes phrases like that sucked does your wife know your playing with her clubs are you going to play or just talk no i still have the honor and looks like youre still away shouldnt take these golfers longer than two weeks to learn
9110440 i am appalled with the lpgas new language policy it is blatantly discriminatory are they going to have the same approach toward players who have personalities not conducive to courting sponsors the policy poses a legal nightmare in implementation
9110441 i can understand why potential pro am partners would not want to pay the high fee to play with a pro who cant communicate with them while playing a round of golf it would also concern me more as a sponsor if the player wearing my logo is not able to communicate with the press and their fellow players without using an interpreter
9110442 i agree with the lpgas new rule regarding the english policy i have played in one of the pro ams at kingsmill in the past though i have been paired with american ladies i have heard complaints about those who cannot speak english it did not make the round fun i hope this change will be viewed as a positive one and sponsors will come back to the great game the ladies play go paula creamer
9110443 this whole civil liberties infringement is garbage these foreign players are welcome to play in their respective countries on their respective professional tours and no one would care but they come to this country because the prize money is much much better accommodations are much much better and then they scream violation of their civil liberties because they have to speak english in the united states where do they think all that money comes from the golf fairy no its american sponsors american tv american patrons who shell out millions to support this tour i dont see many if any foreign companies advertising on the lpga or sponsoring any lpga tournaments do you enough is enough you dont like the lpga tour rules go play someplace else

9110453 although only two keys are described it should be noted that two keys is not a limitation and that more than two keys may be actuated simultaneously to produce one or more control signals
9110454 for example control alt delete functionality may be implemented or larger groups of characters can be typed at the same time
9110455 by way of example during the operation of a music program such as itunes the virtual scroll wheel may appear on the gui of the music program when two fingers are placed on the touch screen rather than one finger which is typically used for tracking in the music program
9110456 in some cases the virtual scroll wheel only appears when two fingers are placed on a predetermined area of the gui
9110457 it should be noted that although a surface scroll wheel is shown the principals thereof can be applied to more conventional scroll wheels which are virtually based
9110458 for example scroll wheels whose axis is parallel to the display screen and which appear to protrude through the display screen in this particular implementation however linear motion of the fingers are used to rotate the virtual scroll wheel

9110464 is it love is it big love or is it great love
9110465 hey if you feel it and you dont do everything in your power to reach for it you are basically slapping life in the face
9110466 you have five smiles pete one when you think someones an idiot one when you think someones really an idiot one when youre getting all dressed up one when youre singing barry white and one when youre looking at me
9110467 i dont at all like knowing what people say of me behind my back it makes me far too conceited
9110468 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect

9110473 acho o prazo surpreendente dada a primeira acusa o ter sido deduzida h mais de oito anos e tamb m dada a import ncia deste caso para a sobreviv ncia deste tribunal
9110474 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
9110475 if you think about it its just in passing like oh thatd be nice to hit one one of these days
9110476 im sure if you play long enough youre going to
9110477 guys have been giving me a hard time all year about not having a walkoff
9110478 i go around and ive got to listen to it every time we go into extra innings now i guess theyll have to pick something else
9110479 it never crossed my mind it was going out of the park
9110480 they could grab somebody out of the stands and he could throw a good game against us it seems like everybody they run out there every time is tough
9110481 i happened to make one bad pitch and it cost us the lead
9110482 i was telling the guys i remember the day when i was able to hit and field my position so i dont know whats going on
9110483 im in favor of anything that makes the game better
9110484 we just didnt know how much better eighty two wins is a big moment and i want this to be the standard of what we do to get that number on an annual basis
9110485 youve got to break through the barrier eventually weve done it now lets move on down the road
9110486 its been a great season and were showing no signs of letting up
9110487 theyre on a roll right now theyre playing very well at home
9110488 at the same time it doesnt mean i cant pitch well

9110494 faced with serious budget problems the loss of large employers and discouraging trends in public education new thinking and new solutions are in order
9110495 the old way of doing business in delaware no longer offers the right tools in a changing world that requires agility creativity and fast shifting innovation
9110496 delaware needs an independent forward thinking decisive and market savvy leader who can take the uncertainty and fear out of moving forward aggressively jack is well prepared to play that role and offers a clear and the best choice for delaware
9110497 john carney and jack markell know we must strengthen our states educational system
9110498 carney however has been part of the states top level of government for eight years and still we lag behind other states spending less our highways are congested and too many waterways are polluted including our own inland bays its time for fresh and more forward thinking

9110513 hab a un arsenal de bombas molotov y lo que se le hubiera ocurrido a los compa eros meter por si hab a guerrita adentro de la c mara
9110514 no fue bueno no era necesario no me consta porque no lo vi fue un error haberlo dicho

9110516 i am concerned about the audience and acceptance time will tell well see
9110517 i had a disease called congenital analgesia which means i couldnt feel anything
9110518 and i was supposed to be in love with you
9110519 ive learned more about the similarities than the differences between then and now
9110520 usually you look back on another era in terms of the milestones but at the same time people were just living their lives
9110521 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
9110522 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
9110523 i didnt have any anxiety like the last thing i want to do is get back on an airplane i did feel like the pilots and the flight attendants handled it perfectly
9110524 for me in songs like losing my ground and voodoo doll i was able to be vulnerable and let people into a subject that a lot of celebrities would just try to hide
9110525 plus being with the guys is like having all these big brothers its not so much about me its about unity and group union i love being part of a team and i love having an outlet where i can sing something about my personal life that would be too self indulgent on a group record
9110526 im sort of cutting my own little swath here through a field and you know ive hit a few stones along the way
9110527 and then going back to the beginning of the novel with more understanding
9110528 im going to revitalize the beginning but im also aware that it did begin in the 70s and 80s

9110536 i took the phone out of his pocket and called his momma and got ahold of his aunt and his grandmother and told them hed be going to shands
9110537 ive been on the phone now for 21 minutes with no response other than the automated system
9110538 our phone service was affected our phone service has been intermittent in that we have not been able to take the call volume that we wanted to we understand that some customers have not been able to reach us
9110539 we need to make a few more changes and repairs to that so we are actually going to make those repairs tonight we going to take that system down for a short time tonight
9110540 the whole community is behind this and pretty excited about it were donating all of our proceeds from the gate tonight to his fund

9110544 people are thrilled theyre absolutely thrilled about the theater opening back up
9110545 some of the incarnations werent as good for the area and i think this will be a big improvement
9110546 the five points area has turned into an entertainment destination shopping dining and now the movies
9110547 youre not just coming just to see a movie and have a glass of wine or a beer youre taking a step back into history
9110548 i heard something go pow and then i looked and i saw two guys just running i realized that they had shot the ice cream man
9110549 the ice cream man is always coming and going you know he seemed like a nice fellow
9110550 when he refused to give them the money they fired one shot and did what most cowards do they ran away
9110551 the world is just getting bad it really is especially when they shoot the ice cream man who is trying to make a living doing the best he can

9110553 today i extend my congratulations to gov sarah palin on this momentous day for her and for our party
9110554 she is an excellent pick for this position and i believe that her dedication work ethic and ability to persuasively advocate for common sense policies will be an asset to the nation
9110555 gov palin knows first hand how important it is for us to increase our nations use of domestic oil reserves and her selection to be sen mccains vice presidential nominee illustrates the importance of the energy issue in our national discussion
9110556 she is a person who would feel at home in southern indiana
9110557 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9110558 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9110559 sarah palins selection is an outstanding example of john mccains willingness to reach out to fresh voices embrace new leadership and continue the republican partys strong support of conservative women leaders
9110560 i dont at all like knowing what people say of me behind my back it makes me far too conceited
9110561 a song is a persons true feelings written down on paper
9110562 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that

9110638 el agua dada la trascendencia que tiene para la vida humana el agua realmente est dentro de la categor a de los derechos humanos
9110639 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo
9110640 ticamente es para nosotros inaceptable sea el proyecto en s mismo que planea construir cinco mega centrales en ays n y consideramos inaceptable la postura del estado frente a estas situaciones que se han ido dando con incluso apoyos p blicos de algunos ministros previo a la presentaci n del proyecto de impacto ambiental
9110641 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
9110642 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n

9110651 its tough to make any kind of decision in a rash moment
9110652 there was no decision made before the tournament and i dont think its time to make a certain statement now
9110653 i never felt like i had my feet underneath me
9110654 i was never in the match the way i wanted to be it was some of my least great tennis i was able to stay in there and try to turn it around
9110655 i was so pissed off that i didnt think about anything

9110686 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
9110687 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
9110688 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
9110689 el conflicto no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
9110690 el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
9110691 la m s importante que haya habido en el pa s por cierto la m s sangrienta
9110692 de modo incomprensible el gobierno se demor m s de 90 d as en dar respuesta a la huelga de hambre de patricia troncoso que la prensa tambi n acall
9110693 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece
9110694 neruda sol a viajar desde temuco a puerto saavedra pues all un colono de apellido winter le prestaba libros en ese tiempo el poeta escribi sus primeras obras los borradores de los veinte poemas de amor pero en todos ellos no hay un solo indio neruda no los vio y eso que en puerto saavedra no hay m s que arena olas y mapuches
9110695 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
9110696 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
9110697 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones
9110698 no hay museo m s chic en chile que el museo de arte precolombino
9110699 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina

9110701 nosotros reconocemos en los mapuches a nuestros ancestros pero andar pregonando que uno ha matado al padre es feo
9110702 si ese fondo no hubiera existido acota bengoa hoy el problema ser a inmanejable
9110703 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
9110704 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad
9110705 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
9110706 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
9110707 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9110708 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9110709 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9110710 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
9110711 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia
9110712 no muy presente en los libros pero si muy viva en la memoria oral de nuestro pueblo
9110713 d nde est curalaba d nde se firm el parlamento de quillen en qu lugar naci kilapan son preguntas que intento responder rescatando lugares geogr ficos y efem rides que debieran llenarnos de orgullo como naci n
9110714 como una tremenda ayuda para los estudiantes pero especialmente para aquellos padres que al ser consultados por sus hijos por sus amistades o por la misma escuela no tienen m s que decir que lo que reza la araucana
9110715 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
9110716 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
9110717 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
9110718 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
9110719 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
9110720 most analysts think biden might help obama win some catholics but certainly not all of them

9110722 obama i just dont think were ready were ready for a woman but not for
9110723 dont cut corners youll just have to take those turns in the end anyway
9110724 unfortunately were never going to know the audience size for just the speech
9110725 but it appears obamas speech is far and away the largest audience for an acceptance speech since nielsen instituted the people meter which was the first time we were able to have persons data

9110730 whether you think you can or you cant youre right
9110731 its feasible that we could get it commercialized within 12 months
9110732 it will be commercially available at reasonable prices for the average consumer uh soon but dont get excited just yet it will be several years before you own anything that includes this technology
9110733 so when barack obamas coin comes out you can still have space for it
9110734 reforming admissions policies would be a good place to start in stopping discrimination
9110735 there are faith schools that are 90 or even 100 funded by the tax payer and yet they only cater or prioritise 5 of the population often faith schools take pupils only from their own faith or even from their own denomination within a faith
9110736 90 of the population have been ruled out straight away
9110737 if they can actually recruit from 100 rather than 10 of those available they will get a better calibre of teacher
9110738 we want to focus on helping bridge the gap of u s vehicles traveling to the iss international space station as efficiently as possible
9110739 the e mail is premature the parameters of the study have not yet been defined
9110740 john mccain hit it out of the park with his selection of governor palin
9110741 this is a bold fresh and exciting choice that clearly demonstrates that republicans arent reading from a script but giving the nation a real choice between an inexperienced senator running with a washington insider versus a true independent minded maverick american hero running with a successful and dynamic female executive a conservative and a reformer who couldnt be further from washington as usual
9110742 tim kaines only virtue as a potential running mate is that he would not have overshadowed senator obama as he is one politician in america less prepared to lead america than obama himself
9110743 but by every other measure kaine would have been a disaster for obama a first term liberal governor with absolutely no accomplishments who just abandoned his home state in the midst of a massive budget deficit to campaign for a promotion
9110744 hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan and they will be left in the city not out of choice but out of necessity
9110745 my thing is my fright is if we have somebody in these houses and theyre not able to get out theyre going to perish
9110746 if i was the governor of louisiana id give the evacuation order as soon as possible
9110747 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9110748 the mechanism by which the judgment was obtained constituted fraud upon the court
9110749 thats very strong language and really so far its been pretty short on facts but well let a judge decide that
9110750 this just is really an implementation of the destruction of the church
9110751 thats part of why the church had to push back
9110752 do not expect the speech to define the presidents legacy this is not an opportunity to recap accomplishments of the past seven and a half years it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9110753 if there is any dna evidence that would be a surprise to me
9110754 i cant comment on any evidence that may be out there
9110755 i stole this yesterday and want to pay for it
9110756 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league

9110758 we do hope that these talks can lead to the finalization of all outstanding matters so that we can start with normalizing the economic political and social situation in zimbabwe
9110759 there was no need for more talks since there was a deal already on the table that was waiting to be signed
9110760 zanu pf has dug a hole for itself it is a tragedy that they want to continue to dig we will not co operate with them if they go ahead with their plans to form a government before the talks reach their logical conclusion
9110761 as to when or whether talks are going to resume i cant say at the moment

9110764 this step is biased and aimed at justifying the aggressive actions of georgia
9110765 i dont think the contemporary west has any means to punish a state that is not quite a rogue state
9110766 the kremlin didnt take tbilisi and didnt shoot mikheil saakashvili what the west can really do expelling russia from the g8 or the world trade organisation isnt important
9110767 strategically putin has increased his personal power and satisfied his personal feeling towards mr saakashvili the war was quite brilliant in its design
9110768 i think they are watching very closely to see what will happen at the eu summit on monday
9110769 but i think the kremlin calculation is that the eu wont react seriously
9110770 yeah but we put our inexperienced candidate at the bottom of our ticket not the top
9110771 my father disappeared and my mother found his body in the morgue they dumped my brothers body in the river

9110858 i am the last born of a big family and also a twin my parents were in the navy so we traveled around a bit and then decided to settle in georgia no i am not a peach per se but
9110859 i was born and raised a redneck from the south in my home town of wichita kansas but i now live in michigan i enjoy football camping occasionally visiting the casino and playing pogo games
9110860 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon
9110861 its definitely an improvement its a positive step for the team its not all doom and gloom
9110862 weve been pretty negative and hard on ourselves and everyone has been hard on us for the last few weeks and deservedly so
9110863 but were still coming fourth and we win next week and were top four so its not the end of the world were still in a good position
9110864 i thought he anasta played very smart exactly why i chose him and the reason that we changed it
9110865 such an inspirational player and such a great leader and someone who has done so much for the club
9110866 its an honour for me but i think it will bring out the best in me and ill just try to lead from the front
9110867 it puts a little bit more pressure on you which is good
9110868 it was awful but i enjoyed it getting a pump like that you dont get that every day
9110869 criticism goes with what we do and if you dwell on it then it pulls you down in the end
9110870 theres not an issue with ivan and myself there never has been
9110871 ive employed him three different times when hes come back from reserve grade coach or state league and then as my assistant coach
9110872 ivans been more than capable hes be very good hes a good coach
9110873 the olympics are over the cowboys arent in the finals the titans arent doing real good the lions arent doing real good theyve been beaten up all year so lets go back to good old reliable broncos well find something there
9110874 thats the reality if you beat yourself up over it nobody cares they just write another story tomorrow and you move on
9110875 you take a thousand photos here and you find in 999 of them im standing there doing nothing
9110876 but you find one and you think oh ill use that one to glorify your point
9110877 theyre both very professional coaches and theyre both very focused on getting the job done and im very relaxed about that
9110878 id love it if we could stay in this position
9110879 you knew i was this way when you met me
9110880 i will never grow or change so dont invest any hopes in me
9110881 its tough to make any kind of decision in a rash moment
9110882 there was no decision made before the tournament and i dont think its time to make a certain statement now
9110883 i never felt like i had my feet underneath me
9110884 i was never in the match the way i wanted to be it was some of my least great tennis i was able to stay in there and try to turn it around
9110885 i was so pissed off that i didnt think about anything
9110886 he is keen to play but at the moment hes 50 50 and we wont risk him if he isnt right
9110887 the test is an important part of our preparation for the tri nations final in brisbane but we wont risk anybody who is questionable
9110888 some people pay 20million for one player we have not paid that for four or for any
9110889 i dont think thats good i dont think its good planning when you get it right at the end
9110890 i think its better to have your business done early and have a pre season etc
9110891 there is no doubt he is a fantastically talented player the question now is can we get him fit and we are hoping we can do that
9110892 he was involved in 17 or 18 games for manchester united last year and if he can be involved in a few more than that for us than he will certainly play a part
9110893 he has been an excellent centre forward throughout the years he can do a bit of everything he can run he can head it he can link play up as well
9110894 if you do get him on the pitch there is no doubt he is a very good player and adds qualities that we will need and i am confident that we can get him out there over the next few years
9110895 if a customer has a hard time getting an item and putting it in a shopping cart its going to reduce sales of it
9110896 he farmer was lively tonight he was playing for his life and thats how i saw jeff
9110897 but theres been other issues along the way and its always an interesting bumpy ride with jeff
9110898 id love to talk to you about jeffs character around the footy club particularly how he gives strength to his other team mates i cant speak highly enough of jeff as a player
9110899 i want josh and robbie to stay but you understand there are issues that players have to deal with and josh is one of those
9110900 well do as much as we can to get josh to stay at the club but if its beyond that then its out of our control
9110901 going forward with the group the main thing that weve learned is that we dont necessarily rely on the heavy hitters in the team
9110902 i think a lot of self belief has been gained by a lot of players that perhaps were either seeing themselves in between the 20 and 40th player but now all of a sudden theyve jumped up and been given an opportunity
9110903 what is it exactly that the vp does every day
9110904 im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration
9110905 john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9110906 thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9110907 it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9110908 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9110909 i dont think the obama people knew what to do right off the bat
9110910 yet another sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9110911 he told her she would be a terrific candidate and that he looked forward to seeing her on the campaign trail
9110912 he also wished her good luck but not too much luck
9110913 former mayor of a town with 9 000 with zero a heartbeat away from the presidency
9110914 i think that uh you know campaigns start getting these uh hair triggers and uh the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9110915 removes one of their stronger arguments against john mccain thinks she is qualified to be president and she is less experienced that obama
9110916 john mccain does not get what ordinary people here in beaver pa are going through
9110917 here is a guy who said we have made great economic progress under i dont think you have seen this economic progress here in beaver pa
9110918 you know our families have just really hit it off
9110919 we had some of his grandkids over for a sleepover with daughters malia and sasha and they just had a great time im absolutely convinced that hugh downs reports
9110920 there are some commonalities between the candidates that come through loud and clear
9110921 both would shift to a health care system that addresses and preempts disease
9110922 and we started to see a trend emerge from the public that although americans say they would back a candidate who supports greater funding for research they dont actually know that much about the positions on this by their elected officials and candidates
9110923 my plan will 1 establish a new public insurance program available to americans who neither qualify for medicaid or state childrens health insurance program schip nor have access to insurance through their employers as well as to small businesses that want to offer insurance to their employees 2 create a national health insurance exchange to help americans and businesses that want to purchase private health insurance directly 3 require all employers to contribute towards health coverage for their employees or towards the cost of the public plan 4 mandate all children have health care coverage 5 expand eligibility for the medicaid and schip programs and 6 allow flexibility for state health reform plans
9110924 the biggest problem with the american health care system is that it costs too much
9110925 commits to promoting healthier lifestyles in schools the workplace and the home as well as preventive services disease management care coordination and other efforts too many americans go without high value preventive services such as cancer screening and immunizations to protect against flu or pneumonia providers are not adequately reimbursed for helping patients manage chronic illnesses like diabetes or asthma our health care system has become a disease care system and the time for change is well overdue
9110926 reduced premiums for healthy lifestyle behavior as well as surcharges for individuals who continue to elect proven unhealthy lifestyle behaviors
9110927 removing school vending machines providing healthy low fat menus in school cafeterias and providing more physical education and recess opportunities
9110928 fda is badly underfunded for its responsibilities as our economy brings a rising tide of imported products the fda urgently needs expert staff and technology to more rigorously inspect imported food drugs and other products like pet food the fda must also be freed from the bush administrations ideological straightjacket to protect the public health on the basis of sound science as president i will end the delays in approving ru 486 the pressures to silence internal drug safety critics and the attempts to protect drug companies from product liability
9110929 americas security is strengthened when we strengthen those weak states that are at risk of collapse economic meltdown or public health crises as president i will double u s foreign aid assistance by 2012 and ensure that we work with other nations to improve international public health
9110930 by helping provide medical care and public health interventions in areas of need we will contribute to a more peaceful and stable world and foster a more positive view of the united states while safeguarding our nations health and strengthening our national security
9110931 our public health departments workforce and finances are stretched too thin to carry out traditional public health functions such as ensuring our water is safe to drink the air is safe to breathe and out food is safe eat these traditional public health functions have evolved to include responsibility for disaster preparedness and responding to both natural and man made disasters accordingly i will champion a renewed focus and the necessary resources to improve public health and prevention
9110932 the field of public health would benefit from greater research
9110933 are our first line of response against public health threats both natural and man made everything from a flu outbreak to bioterrorism w e need to ensure that there is an important focus on developing a strong regional and national strategic plan that focuses on better coordination improved communication capabilities and greater accountability
9110934 i will ensure that there are proper incentives in place to address the workforce shortage
9110935 my plan would reverse the presidents policy that has allowed hundreds of thousands of frozen embryos left over from in vitro fertilization to simply be discarded
9110936 i am a long time supporter of mental health parity i helped pass the illinois mental health parity law and my national public health plan will include coverage of all essential medical services including preventive maternity and mental health care
9110937 i support mental health parity to ensure that mental health coverage is on par with medical and surgical benefits
9110938 one of the keys to eliminating waste and missed opportunities in our health care system is to increase our investment in comparative effectiveness reviews and research
9110939 although comparative effectiveness research holds great promise in helping us improve the value of health care spending by better informing us about effectiveness of treatments we need to ensure that this does not stifle the spirit of innovation in our medical sciences and maintains patient choice
9110940 t he u s has the potential to lose its global competitive edge in science technology and innovation unless we take steps to change the current trend

9110962 el nico medio para salir ganando de una discusi n es evit ndola
9110963 guys i think its time for me to be on my own now
9110964 approximately 80 per cent of offenders coming into the system have some type of substance abuse problem
9110965 it helps the gangs that develop in the system organized crime and the hierarchy develops
9110966 so for the first time in their life theres a possibility where they can actually be in a drug free environment and actually break free of addictions that ruin the lives of so many people
9110967 we have brought up several of our concerns which we see incorporated in this
9110968 its good to see that they are actually taking the zero tolerance stance very seriously
9110969 we want to see those enhanced but for those to be effective we have to stop the flow of drugs into the institution
9110970 were going to have a drug problem in prisons for as long as we persist in pursuing an unworkable drug control strategy outside prisons
9110971 its a fallacy to think that we can successfully make prisons drug free when 100 years of drug prohibition has not made canadian society drug free
9110972 i know for certain p and p cabinets influential planning and priorities committee was told last week
9110973 they had a political discussion and during that political discussion they concluded that all things being equal they would like to go before the eighth
9110974 obviously at that point there were some outstanding issues how to respond to the opposition leaders but it was agreed that they would go before the eighth if at all possible and this fall for sure
9110975 all those factors outweighed the grief they were going to take for breaking their own legislation
9110976 if you let the by elections take place and you do super well in the by elections then it looks like you are an opportunist if you dont do so well as people expect in the by elections you look like the momentum has gone
9110977 and if youre determined to go it looks like this is what you do
9110978 its trademark harper in that hes making an unexpected decision and once he makes it hes going to pursue it full steam ahead and take the gamble
9110979 this is what he lives for this sort of high stakes politics this is what galvanizes him really gets him excited this is when hes at his best
9110980 youd rather have control of events yourself rather than waiting for other people to act
9110981 this allows harper to control the timing rather than sit passively and wait for dion to make up his mind
9110982 harper cares about senate reform and senate reform is the one issue where this parliament hasnt made any progress on the governments agenda
9110983 he always told me that he wanted to keep governing and he thought he gained by governing demonstrating being able to govern and i think he was sincere in that for a couple of years
9110984 but parliament has become such a circus that just being part of it isnt really helping him much any more its so degrading all the stuff that is happening i dont think it bolsters him any longer i think the situation has changed
9110985 that created the consensus certainly within the pmo where it suddenly dawned on us okay were going to go in the fall
9110986 when it was clear that we were not going to survive until october 2009 if the opposition had their way then it was just a matter of who should control the timing should it be us or should it be them

9110991 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
9110992 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
9110993 we are excited and proud to have a respected expert such as scott joining our team
9110994 our advisory board will be instrumental in furthering our mission of empowering photographers in an increasingly online world
9110995 i believe photrades business model will redefine the photography industry
9110996 with millions of photographers worldwide having their photos stolen its time for someone to stand up for them i joined photrades advisory board because they are giving control back to photographers with their proprietary monetization and protection platform
9110997 and yet no action was taken by the establishment to correct the problem
9110998 minor findings are part of the audit process and are not uncommon
9110999 and were not well trained in the performance of their inspection tasks
9111000 i would however like to voice my concern over the tone of general statements made in the draft final report
9111001 nineteen of 20 slaughter and or processing establishments including cold storage had deficiencies in sanitation performance standards
9111002 in addition some of the sps requirements were not being enforced adequately in 19 of 20 establishments
9111003 even though this employee had a slightly raised area to stand on he was surrounded by water with blood in it
9111004 la polic a me inform que el contrato est firmado as
9111005 s lo se guardaban tambores no hab a un laboratorio
9111006 it got to a point where the money was too much for what we wanted to pay
9111007 we thought we had made a considerable offer but when there was the threat of an offer sheet at such exaggerated dollars it would have been too difficult
9111008 i think we got two good players i know filip kuba very well from my days way back with the florida panthers hes a real solid person and he can run the point on the power play picard is a local kid and a high end prospect
9111009 i really think were solid with filip kuba and smith and volchenkov and phillips im not even sure what our top four is thats up to coach craig hartsburg but we have depth that we didnt have before
9111010 we are very excited to acquire the rights of andrej meszaros
9111011 andrej is a perfect fit within our plan to rebuild the lightning into a contender he has a strong all around game he competes he moves the puck and he can handle big strong forwards defensively
9111012 perhaps most importantly were pleased to add a 22 year old player with almost 250 nhl games already under his belt
9111013 i have given everything i have got to the team every time i competed
9111014 i love playing football i love being involved in football and i love the team camaraderie
9111015 after sundays game i will look forward to the next chapter of my life
9111016 georgian people are strong spiritually and physically and no enemy can break them down let us ask god to deliver us from seen and unseen enemies and turn them all into friends
9111017 today we have a great crisis in georgia a big war is starting i think our patriarch told us to pray every day
9111018 if you dont take him off the field as a coach he will just about die out there
9111019 that impacted my decision its a michael irvin type work ethic thats what we are talking about with felix jones
9111020 si dios es todopoderoso puede hacer una roca tan grande que no pueda con ella
9111021 ya que dios es todopoderoso por definici n no puede hacer algo que sea m s poderoso que l mismo incluyendo una roca que no pueda cargar pero puede hacer la mayor roca posible y cargar con ella ya que pedir a dios que cree una piedra que no sea capaz de cargar es pedirle algo sin sentido como si le pidieras que creara un hermano hijo nico o un circulo cuadrado
9111022 dios est m s all de nuestro entendimiento y conocimiento

9111030 im stunned this choice suggests mccain thinks he has an uphill climb to win this election
9111031 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house
9111032 it is almost impossible to exaggerate how important that is to the conservative faith community
9111033 this is a choice that allows mccain to keep the base happy but it also allows him to reinforce his image as a maverick

9111498 this is an historic moment for us as this is the first time for more than hundred years that a brewery in norway has made a sour beer using wild yeast and lactic acid bacteria this beer was brewed in sept 06 and has since then been aged in oak barrels until bottling day the beer is blended for roundness but is still very sour and a little bit acetic we think our first attempt has been a great success and we will definitely try this again this beer is not pasteurised and will develop further with aging
9111499 dobbel dose or dobbel dram is a double ipa made with european style hops rather than us hops this beer is also heavily dryhopped in the aging tank for the extra hop taste and aroma made from marris otter malt wheat malt and crystal goes well with spicy food and grilled meat
9111500 this is our porter or norse porter in the us the old farmhouse breweries of norway made many special beers and they where all dark hearty earthy beers like this classic porter full of dark malts it was customary to make special beers for special occasions like weddings christenings and even funerals made from marris otter pale munich crystal and brown malt some chocolate malt and lots of hops for bittering and aroma goes well with steaks grilled meat and dark chocolate or sweet deserts

9111506 governor palin brings another strong pro life voice to the republican ticket in sharp contrast to the pro abortion ticket of barack obama and joe biden
9111507 between an avowed pro abortion ticket that would continue to push for unrestricted abortion on demand and a strongly pro life ticket that will bring us closer to a society that embraces the value and dignity of human life
9111508 governor palin will change the dynamics of the entire presidential race
9111509 her admirable record of confronting corruption and living her pro life convictions shows she is a doer not just a talker sarah palin will make history as a vice presidential candidate and not simply because shes a woman but because shes a woman of substance and character

9111512 personnel is policy with the selection of gov palin sen john mccain has proven that he can exercise sound judgment
9111513 the selection of gov palin means that this upcoming election will be historic but beyond making history palin brings substance and excitement she is intelligent young attractive and articulate as a woman and a mother she can attract women voters particularly those who feel disenfranchised
9111514 sarah palin is the whole package women voters are electrified and sarah is someone who is truly in sync with the way real american women think

9111568 walang anim na buwan pero yung huling soap ko kasi sa kanila maliit lang ang role ko minsan once every two weeks lang ang taping ko pero sa totoo lang naging mahirap din sa akin ang magdesisyon
9111569 iba naman siya drama siya masasabi kong ibang iba siya sa mga ginagawa kong huli na puro mga fantasies ang ginawa ko maiba naman ito this time alam ko na medyo fit ang pagka kontrabida niya kasi bida kontrabida hindi tipong galit lang siya nang walang dahilan ito yung tipong malalim ang pinanggagalingan ng character
9111570 siyempre sina piolo pascual although nakatrabaho ko naman siya sa manila yung indie movie na siya ang nag produce and then sina john lloyd cruz bea alonzo okey na nagawa ko na si anne curtis gusto ko siyang makita kasi nami miss ko na siya at saka si angel locsin gusto ko ng reunion
9111571 pero noong time kasi na yun palaging may pumapasok na isang show e ang huling soap ko sa kanila gma 7 april pa which is ang tagal ko nang walang ginagawa so yun
9111572 hindi ko alam kung paano mo nasabi yan humarap ka sa akin ngayon at sabihin mo kung paano mo masasabing ingrata ako sa kahit na anong paraan kasi wala akong makitang dahilan para masabihan ng ganoon and in fairness naman sa lahat ng lumapit sa akin walang nagsabi na mali ang desisyon ko at sigurado nga ako na nasa tama naman ako
9111573 walang anim na buwan pero yung huling soap ko kasi sa kanila maliit lang ang role ko minsan once every two weeks lang ang taping ko pero sa totoo lang naging mahirap din sa akin ang magdesisyon
9111574 kasi dalawa ang pinag anuhan ko e saying no and saying goodbye kapag nag yes ako rito abs cbn goodbye ang ibig sabihin nun e mahirap mag no sa isang napakagandang offer parang hay good luck pero naniniwala naman ako na kung sinuman ang naka bonding ko roon gma 7 mga kaibigan ko naman silang tunay at makikita at makikita ko pa rin sila ulit
9111575 masaya medyo hirap lang ako kasi medyo mahigpit ang mga guards dito
9111576 pero naiintindihan ko naman like si bea super bait si john lloyd na kaklase ko dati noong nandito ako sa abs may school dito di ba si direk erick salud na director ko dati sa cyberkada parang bumalik lang ako noong 13 ako
9111577 may ilang kasi hindi naman nila ako nakitang lumaki pero im sure masasabi nilang walang nagbago sa akin kung ano ako ngayon yun ako 10 years ago
9111578 pero after nun nakalimutan ko na naiisip ko kapag nalulungkot ako maraming beses na o ano na ang gagawin ko after nito siguro uuwi na talaga ko sa italy pero tingnan natin kung ano ang pangarap ni god kasi marami akong ideas marami akong gustong gawin hindi lang sa showbiz lang business or kung anuman
9111579 no bakit logo ba siya ng gma para matakot ako sa kanya
9111580 hindi naman kumbaga kung anuman ang amin tapos na siya matagal na more than a year na yan na nangyari nagkataon lang talaga
9111581 the united states should be concerned at the recent developments i e moa ad the opposition to it and the renewed war in the south in the 30 year bloody struggle between the moro islamic liberation front milf rebel group and the philippine government after all it was washington that granted independence to a unified majority christian philippine state in 1946 despite calls by moro muslims for a separate status these grievances later crystallized into a full blown insurgency
9111582 the best way to test the milfs sincerity unity and capacity all of which are major concerns of critics of the peace deal is to give the milf its first opportunity to govern as a willing partner the ball would then be in the milfs court allowing the philippine government to test the group before determining its future posture the approach is at least worth a try contrary to popular belief the milf remains a homegrown nationalist group with limited ties to international terror networks and its steadfast commitment to a peace accord despite a near two year deadlock suggests it is more committed to the peace process than critics give it credit for
9111583 a final peace deal will continue to be caught up in intense political infighting unless the arroyo administration can muster the political will to overcome a host of significant obstacles as it navigates through heated debates the administration would do well to clarify its policies in order to squelch speculation and educate the public about this controversial issue like specifying exactly which constitutional amendments it may seek
9111584 the next u s administration for its part should continue to play a constructive role in the southern philippines that means encouraging the philippine government to go forward with the peace deal as well as playing a largely behind the scenes role in facilitating negotiations all this should be done with adroit diplomacy that is ever mindful of stoking the sensitivities of philippine nationalism washington must also continue its robust counterterrorism assistance in the region which involves a holistic approach of economic development and military training that will play a vital role in bringing sustainable peace to an underdeveloped region marred by violence in this way the philippines can continue to be a model for how the u s can help its allies battle international terror and constructively facilitate reconciliation with nationalist rebel groups

9111629 we didnt score early but we scored when the team needed it the most
9111630 i was thinking i just need to come through right here and at least tie the game
9111631 i knew it was going to be gone and i was happy because this is a team we really need to beat
9111632 theyre playing good baseball and i screwed it up my last few outings have been horrible
9111633 we keep the team in the game because we understand we have a really good offense
9111634 every game right now is of equal importance and significance
9111635 i normally see the ball well hes a good pitcher hopefully i can keep that up well see what happens
9111636 we never really had another opportunity he pitched really really well
9111637 i didnt get down on myself after the first inning
9111638 i put it behind me and didnt let it get me down
9111639 he threw the ball better than he has all year
9111640 but at some point our pitchers have to understand that a good outing is a win you can lose a game in the first inning we have to change the mentality that someone threw well but lost 4 3 10 5 or whatever
9111641 it takes a little pressure off knowing that one swing isnt going to beat you
9111642 youd like to tack on and make it easier throughout the game but bush made it hold up
9111643 the last time he left a lot of pitches up today he threw more strikes we just hit his mistakes when he made some
9111644 the first pitch to encarnacion wasnt a bad pitch a changeup that was kind of flat
9111645 thats really what did us in tonight the defense we just made too many mistakes there gave them too many outs
9111646 we needed this offense for our confidence they helped us out with their defense
9111647 if you think about it its just in passing like oh thatd be nice to hit one one of these days
9111648 im sure if you play long enough youre going to
9111649 guys have been giving me a hard time all year about not having a walkoff
9111650 i go around and ive got to listen to it every time we go into extra innings now i guess theyll have to pick something else
9111651 it never crossed my mind it was going out of the park
9111652 they could grab somebody out of the stands and he could throw a good game against us it seems like everybody they run out there every time is tough
9111653 i happened to make one bad pitch and it cost us the lead
9111654 i was telling the guys i remember the day when i was able to hit and field my position so i dont know whats going on
9111655 when hes a starter hes a four pitch pitcher his curveball and slider are getting better
9111656 you can pitch great but then they could trade for nolan ryan josh beckett or roger clemens and all of a sudden youre not starting any more
9111657 not enough production not enough two out hits thats a big part of it
9111658 i think the biggest part of the inning was marcus being safe at first
9111659 he hustled all the way and was there when the first baseman dropped the ball
9111660 couple of guys get on and curtis comes up with the big hit and it kept coming
9111661 a broken bat falls jam em with a pitch it falls in two seeing eye singles
9111662 its getting to the point in the season where were heading into september and he seems to have a lot left
9111663 we didnt hit we didnt play defense and we didnt pitch
9111664 weve had a lot of 10 day road trips this year
9111665 to not have anymore to be done with them is definitely nice
9111666 i dont think that just reaching that number in and of itself has that much meaning
9111667 we were up 4 0 and it was nice just to put a little stamp on it especially with the way dice k had been pitching
9111668 he didnt seem like a guy that would be mad
9111669 i worry more about pedroia than i do about big papi right now
9111670 right now that kid is the key to the ballclub
9111671 youve got to break through the barrier eventually weve done it now lets move on down the road
9111672 its been a great season and were showing no signs of letting up
9111673 theyre on a roll right now theyre playing very well at home
9111674 at the same time it doesnt mean i cant pitch well
9111675 he was frustrated that he gave up the home runs
9111676 ill deal with it when i say ill deal with it wont mean that ill ignore it ill deal with which means ill do something about it
9111677 i asked for six innings and i got exactly what i asked for
9111678 he did what he had to do he went out there and he made pitches
9111679 its good to go out there every fifth game and feel good
9111680 im not exactly going out there and being totally dominant
9111681 after all his injuries to be able to get two wins this year i think he feels pretty good
9111682 all these remaining games were doing what we have to do
9111683 just the one pitch where the first run scored that was not where i wanted it
9111684 its coming to america first the cradle of the best and of the worst its here theyve got the range and the machinery for change its here theyve got the spiritual thirst

9111716 what about hillarys supporters who were already talking about backing mccain before the announcement of his vp
9111717 i believe that group has diminished since the clintons endorsement support and expressed commitment to obama during the dnc
9111718 they backed bush b c they reduced the election to issues of sex abortion and same sex marriage
9111719 that support and vote is less about their faith than it is about their comfort of living a black religious person or family whos fallen on really hard times and sees no relief in site their health is in jeopardy and they have no health insurance or weak insurance they cant find work because jobs are being exported their small businesses are on the verge of failing their young children have no choice but to attend terrible schools and their college bound children are discouraged because they dont see how they can make a college education a reality just like the white lifetime republican woman who spoke at the dnc is not going to vote mccain
9111720 as far as these issues are concerned thats between the individuals and god god allows them free will but im going to contradict that in the name of faith who are these people fooling those in the black church who vote republican based on these two issues of sex are misguided or showing off their republican vote is more a reflection of how well theyre living or again their ignorance and lack of understanding

9111742 three important rules for breaking up dont put off breaking up when you know you want to prolonging the situation only makes it worse tell him honestly simply kindly but firmly dont make a big production dont make up an elaborate story this will help you avoid a big tear jerking scene if you wanna date other people say so be prepared for the boy to feel hurt and rejected even if youve gone together for only a short time and havent been too serious theres still a feeling of rejection when someone says she prefers the company of others to your exclusive company but if youre honest and direct and avoid making a flowery emotional speech when you brake the news the boy will respect you for your frankness and honestly hell appreciate the kind of straight forward manner in which you told him your decision unless hes a real jerk or a cry baby youll remain friends

9111801 hunter biden met with the obama senate office not with senator obama
9111802 its hardly surprising that a senator from illinois would fight for investments in mercy hospital thorek hospital and st xavier university right in illinois or that hed be joined in that effort by a republican colleague representative judy biggert
9111803 r hunter biden a washington lobbyist and son of u s presidential hopeful senator joseph biden fraudulently excluded a partner from the purchase of a hedge fund investment firm the partner claims in a lawsuit biden and his uncle james biden squeezed investment consultant anthony lotito jr out of the 2006 acquisition of new york based paradigm cos lotito says in a complaint filed jan 5 in new york state court the bidens lied to lotito about their joint offer while negotiating a better deal alone lotitos complaint says the bidens deny the claims he wants back what was stolen from him said lotitos lawyer brian wille of kostelanetz amp fink llp in new york he entered into this transaction believing in the honesty and integrity of the bidens hunter biden 36 founder and partner of washington based lobbying firm oldaker biden amp belair llp stepped down this month from daily oversight of paradigm global advisors llc a unit of paradigm cos that manages investments in hedge funds he became the firms chairman and remains a lobbyist an unusual dual role as scrutiny of the hedge fund industry has increased
9111804 had james and hunter biden known the truth about anthony lotito they never would have gone into business with him
9111805 it is apparent that mr lotito is only invoking senator bidens name to garner media attention

9111813 from beginning to end this has been a very rough experience
9111814 there will be a lot of people who will benefit from this now and unfortunately in the future
9111815 certain kinds of organisms have been known to get in and not necessarily cause any harm
9111816 nasty piece of work pennys from heaven hell on wheels powerful and just plain talented
9111817 of the hard working husband and wife duo at behind the world productions inc
9111818 the students need to know there are alternatives to the military
9111819 are we going to pursue litigation i think its pretty clear that the school board isnt giving us any choice to do anything else
9111820 at one time hundreds of people worked there there was hope now its empty there are just no jobs
9111821 they felt they were putting too much pressure on teenagers to join the military
9111822 all we want to do is make students aware that there are other ways to find college money and serve your country without joining the military we want to save lives
9111823 we allow recruiters into the schools to recruit for post high school opportunities but she wasnt offering that
9111824 were just not going to allow her to do that anymore
9111825 i may not like it but you have to live by the rules
9111826 now i hear the same chorus from many parents i dont want my son or daughter to get shot but i tell them that just because theres a war not everyone goes but thats a hard message to get across especially when you come across parents who watched full metal jacket one too many times it becomes very difficult
9111827 its all about opportunities we give them a chance to leave and make a better life there arent many opportunities here for young people
9111828 we want to take a trip somewhere near home that doesnt require a jet plane or a long car trip
9111829 we especially like to see what florida had to offer before the big theme parks arrived
9111830 that was one of the most memorable trips weve ever taken
9111831 although people are looking to save money they are still going to take a vacation
9111832 there is a lot of undiscovered florida even for long term residents
9111833 traditionally we have a lot of florida residents but even more so now that gas prices have soared
9111834 and once they are here they feel like theyve been somewhere else because we are so different from the hustle and bustle of the theme parks
9111835 the b amp b was completely renovated and we didnt even have to drive anywhere we just walked the short distance to downtown micanopy and visited the quaint little town it was like a trip down memory lane

9111837 if you want others to be happy practice compassion if you want to be happy practice compassion
9111838 the vice president is a heartbeat away from becoming president so to choose someone with not one hours worth of experience on national issues is a dangerous choice
9111839 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken
9111840 i mean to tell you it set that crowd on fire
9111841 it is almost impossible to exaggerate how important that is to the conservative faith community
9111842 hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan and they will be left in the city not out of choice but out of necessity
9111843 my thing is my fright is if we have somebody in these houses and theyre not able to get out theyre going to perish
9111844 the mccain campaign is reveling in the fact that palin is a game changer
9111845 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team
9111846 while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9111847 oh i had an idea for a novel i might just tippy tap away and see what happens

9111854 south johnston really tried to stack it up in the box to start with so that forced us to took to throw more
9111855 morton just did a great job getting the ball to our guys and they just made plays with the ball
9111856 the times we were able to throw it opened things up and we were able to pound it a little bit
9111857 but i saw enough tonight to know that we can be pretty good
9111858 i thought our kids did a great job rallying around the team
9111859 our main focus all week has been business as usual obviously you want to think of the kid and his family and our prayers are with them but you also dont want to take our focus off what youve got to do thats tough for young kids but im proud of them they did a great job
9111860 i never thought we could score that many points against them
9111861 theyre the ones making the tradition here no one else is and this is where it started
9111862 last week the wildcats scored 24 points after they got down
9111863 we have worked hard and our no 1 goal has been to play tight as a team
9111864 kinerja pasar lebih baik setelah keluar laporan pendapatan di luar sektor finansial semuanya baik yang memberi dukungan pada pasar
9111865 my personal take i think the volt would make a great pontiac
9111866 what greater brand than pontiac to charge ahead with that technology
9111867 john mccain has once again shown he is willing to in fact eager to move in a positive and relatively unexpected direction he is his own man obama the agent of change picked the most conventional of the conventional
9111868 the notable fuel efficiency of boeings 777 combined with the airplanes extensive range and large cargo capacity is something egyptair values highly in this competitive environment
9111869 as a new member of the star alliance we look forward to increasing our connectivity across the globe and bringing our passengers the utmost in cabin comfort and service with a dynamic new business class layout that will debut on the 777 300er
9111870 wed like to congratulate egyptair on its order and acquisition of boeing 777 300ers and on the airlines induction into the star alliance
9111871 the 777s operational performance with its significant savings in fuel and maintenance costs will have a positive impact on egyptairs growth plans and help the airline achieve greater profitability

9111873 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before
9111874 have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun
9111875 she hasnt really had an opportunity to practice with her teammates
9111876 those three games we knew were just more getting her ready mentally for the olympics than it was for us
9111877 it was time for her to take the next step there was no more rehab to do
9111878 she was a huge factor in how we played because of her strength and size she could intimidate people on the defensive end and there were very few people who could stop her 1 on 1 in the post offensively
9111879 im not getting much sleep that jet lag is really kicking my butt right now but im going to get there and be all right im glad i had a chance to go out there and show what i have after coming off a knee injury
9111880 we expect her to slowly progressively start to fill up the stat box and everything else the way we know she can
9111881 if offensively it has to wait and defensively shes a presence then well wait for that
9111882 lisa leslie and delisha milton jones have done this in the past and i dont see it as being a big factor
9111883 in the last two years parker has played a lot of basketball ill be monitoring her more than the other two
9111884 i slept the entire ride on the plane from start to finish
9111885 i came back and was wide awake couldnt sleep at night
9111886 all of us play overseas so we know what its like to come back and practice or play right away even if youre not sleeping that much
9111887 i dont want to talk up china because then it makes it sound like greece was bad
9111888 greece wasnt bad it was amazing as well china though everything from the people the venues the way things were run there it really was first class
9111889 they werent ready with cabs other than that you really cant complain
9111890 youre talking about a city with over 17 million people in the space and size of rhode island
9111891 its a pretty high powered city in general anyway the enormity of it is probably what strikes me the people there did a great job of putting on the olympics they were great hosts
9111892 the chinese people were really gracious and kind throughout the whole tournament very helpful
9111893 the city was really prepared and made the whole thing a great experience
9111894 we believe its some kind of a methamphetamine production were not exactly sure what phase of the production they were in

9111898 theres a liquid oxygen system which allows us to have a greater capacity of oxygen its a cleaner oxygen
9111899 should we lose power in the unit we can continue to operate all the electrical outlets which is an absolute necessity when youre transporting critical care patients
9111900 in an interview with two weeks ago alaska gov sarah palin r said she had met presumptive gop presidential nominee sen john mccain only once or twice
9111901 about the position before offering it in person earlier this week
9111902 think of it as a dinner party thrown by revolutionaries
9111903 good food is not just for the middle class we want to make it accessible
9111904 when you take the time to do things right you are rewarded
9111905 the more you learn the more you realize you dont want to eat a lot of whats being shipped into supermarkets
9111906 i dont want to serve something to my guests that i wont eat myself
9111907 we dont take time to eat and celebrate food were on the run putting things in our body that dont make sense
9111908 this is a very grass roots effort that connects young artists environmentalists and young people all of whom are engaged for their own reason

9111945 theyd play scrabble and drink and crack jokes and crack jokes and argue frank always won and he was always very braggadocio about it too it was all jocular they didnt get polluted drunk and frank never really did drugs though he and stan would smoke pot together
9111946 stan had been promising to bring barry by because we all had that in common franks kids were half white stans grandson was half black and my son was half black we all had that in common and we all really enjoyed it we got a real kick out of reality
9111947 i was rather disconcerted to see that the arrangements put in place for ramadan which we support for muslim colleagues have been imposed upon all councillors
9111948 we object to the request that non muslim councillors observe the fasting rules for ramadan this sends out the wrong message to our community
9111949 our community consists of a huge number of different religions all of which should be valued and no one religion should be accorded more status or influence than others
9111950 it is requested that members do not partake of any refreshments until after the iftar refreshments are served
9111951 all thats being asked for is courtesy to be shown to the sensitivities around some councillors eating during council meetings whilst others in the room are fasting
9111952 we are building this for all the people of cologne not just muslims
9111953 the mosque will be a symbol of co existence in peace and trust and without fear
9111954 i got up to have a look but the moment i got to the door i was attacked suddenly immediately i was struck on the head with a blow which made me totter
9111955 father sergio baldin came to my aid he put himself in front of me to try and defend me but he too was knocked down without mercy they hit him until he stopped crying out then they beat father salvatore and father martin as well it was terrible
9111956 presumably the attackers thought they would find riches at the monastery
9111957 it is beyond question that by acting in the way that he did mr khan killed mr brown unlawfully and whatever their differences the fact is that mr brown lost his life
9111958 that is a consequence for which mr khan must be punished with a significant custodial sentence
9111959 a powerful small state with healthy government finances only tasks that society deems important and which cannot be fulfilled or cannot only be fulfilled by individuals or groups should be stimulated by the state or carried out by it
9111960 tax levies are unavoidable but the tax burden must remain as low as possible
9111961 means individuals should take into account the culture and norms of our society in their actions the dutch society has its origin in the judaic christian tradition humanism and the enlightenment these historic foundations along with the dutch language national history and constitution form the basis of our national identity
9111962 the vvd goes on the offensive against the terrorism of mediocrity for the hardworking who give form and content to their own future
9111963 fights for the elevation of the underclass via good education and by not making people dependent on a government but helping them to stand on their own feet
9111964 regards individual freedom both mentally and materialistically as the highest good
9111965 responsibility as the ethical fundament under a society of free people
9111966 we respect freedom and tolerance but the festival is a kind of provocation since it is taking place during ramadan
9111967 bosnia is a conservative society and i doubt that such an event would be accepted
9111968 a small group of people promoting ideas which do not represent basic values
9111969 weve been preparing the project for the past year and i would not spend my time only to provoke someone
9111970 bosnia and herzegovina is a traditional and patriarchic society in which different sexualities and or identities are not accepted
9111971 queer sarajevo festival will offer a space in which we will evoke and reexamine heteronormativity and patriarchic values
9111972 we regret this step from the georgian side it will not assist our bilateral relations
9111973 what are we to do yes it the embassy will close and only the consulate will remain
9111974 within the coming days georgia will withdraw all diplomats from its embassy in moscow
9111975 it is a downgrade of diplomatic relations not a complete cut
9111976 orders the executive power to cut diplomatic ties with the russian federation
9111977 russian armed forces including so called peacekeepers are declared as occupying armed forces
9111978 there was a mistake in a recipe for apple cake instead of calling for two pinches of nutmeg it said 20 nutmeg nuts were needed
9111979 we know that four adults ate one cake made from this recipe and they didnt feel well
9111980 at first we thought this would be enough because we didnt really think anyone would bake or eat this cake since so much nutmeg would give it a horrible bitter taste and because it is simply not that easy to get hold of that much nutmeg

9111992 i would love to get with those young guys and help them win because i know they are right at the next step of getting to the super bowl
9111993 i would love to be a part of clevelands organization and help them get to that next level
9111994 only time will tell with that one there are a lot of things that go into it what we think about the guys we have and things like that sometimes finances get involved so you just take each situation differently and day by day and see
9111995 any team with a superstar could clear cap space and use that same approach with bird rights
9111996 id like to win the game for one the other thing is id like for us to look decent it seems that the consensus is that we were decent in the jets game even though we lost that one id like to look decent against the bears and go from there
9111997 entire state delegations were brow beaten into voting present or passing their votes to other states

9112004 so how many pumas are there well what about 18 million
9112005 the reversal of roe v wade represents only one step in the long path toward ending abortion government must find new ways to empower and strengthen these armies of compassion these important groups pro life can help build the consensus necessary to end abortion at the state level
9112006 and it doesnt seem fair that palin should get so much fanfare the same goes with ferraro
9112007 coming from a woman candidate with any kind of perceived whine
9112008 palin was not a gimmick pick mccain fires up his base along with respecting women and their accomplishments it was a bold maverick move nobama made the lame safe move with his pick and highlighted his no experience in doing it
9112009 you know what really ticks me off oreilly and loudmouth laura ingraham saying are feminists gonna speak out again msnbc and what they are saying about palin where the hell were they when hillary was being savaged twofaced sobs and of course ill speak out about the crap they spout and its only because shes a woman and doesnt deserve to be treated they way hillary was treated

9112012 claire mccaskill was elected two years ago so she wont be up this november
9112013 i was just thinking that gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9112014 no women who were for hillary will vote for mccain palin because they are not pro choice
9112015 well well see how she looks after the media vets her
9112016 you should not waste your precious time watching cnn they only stir you spirit and disturbed your peace of mind cnn has never and will never give the clintons just due but to tell you the truth no one believes anything they say except the kool aid drinkers they know now how they royally f up by crowning obama and they are dead in the water i never watched fox until the primaries and the only tv station that was fair to hillary was fox i only watch fox now and they have the highest rating because the deliver the news they dont create it turn off cnn keep your peace of mind and know by doing that you also lower their viewer ratings that should bring a smile to your face

9112031 hezbollah succeeded in incorporating the idea of resistance as part of the international anti globalization movements
9112032 through our contacts with these groups we have managed to challenge the idea that hezbollah is a dogmatic terrorist islamist organization and convince part of the international left that we can be a strong partner
9112033 we think of the sacrifices of all the militants in lebanon and palestine and the arab world from islamists to nationalists to arabists or any ideological background they come from
9112034 hezbollah is aware today of the importance of cultivating contacts with the west
9112035 social forums are open spaces of discussion they present an opportunity for a group like hezbollah to participate and give their opinions
9112036 it was a potent symbol that right makes might and that a guerrilla ready to fight for its people can succeed
9112037 some leftist groups refuse to consider what islamist organizations are about their oppressive practices their violations of rights their dogmatic rhetoric

9112219 dear democratic women please pretend our vp candidate is hillary clinton just forget that shes pro life and against most things democrats stand for
9112220 can you say john mccain is a swell guy and tell us that he was a pow
9112221 who in gods name are you and please tell us why you should be a heart beat from the presidency
9112222 please oh please dont sing the how old are you now part
9112223 the selection of sarah palin now allows barack obama to campaign untouched by the republican ticket john mccains only other option is for himself to personally become negative for two months which is disaster in presidential politics
9112224 we have no fear of making all the bits available
9112225 stumbled on a model that endorses differentiation by all vendors
9112226 should all politicians be hung from lamp posts for working with questionable characters
9112227 should we trust john mccain a man once talked to a business man about tax breaks and was later exhonorated of any misconduct or barak obama who has ties to a known and unrepentant bomber he keeps trying to cover up
9112228 its no secret that the republican party has gone from a party that advocates a small government that stays out of americans personal lives to a party that meddles only when it suits them to enact tax breaks for the wealthiest to chip away at abortion rights through any means available to make sure that gays and lesbians know for darn sure that the government disapproves of who they are
9112229 the us media and blogosphere is calling sarah palin a
9112230 its no secret that the republican party has gone from a party that advocates a small government that stays out of americans personal lives to a party that meddles only when it suits them to enact tax breaks for the wealthiest to chip away at abortion rights through any means available to make sure that gays and lesbians know for darn sure that the government disapproves of who they are
9112231 im not going to allow a political will to tarnish my reputation
9112232 mccain declared as the pair stood together for the first time at a boisterous rally in ohio just days before the opening of the partys national convention
9112233 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9112234 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9112235 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9112236 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9112237 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9112238 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9112239 he sees sarah governor palin as the future of the party
9112240 these are people hed like to elevate in that regard reformers
9112241 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency
9112242 i was grateful to have all those months to prepare
9112243 absolutely yup yup especially with a good team around us
9112244 well the recalls therell be a few more as we get out into the secondary processors and some of the third line
9112245 some of this product went out somewhere and other sandwiches were made out of it thats the nature of the recalls as they grow
9112246 the most important information for consumers is as we go out there we are providing further precision that informs them and lets them recognize these products in ways they werent able to do with the initial recall
9112247 it certainly does shake the confidence of consumers to know that its taking this amount of time
9112248 it just demonstrates that our need to make sure that we have absolute vigilance throughout this process is paramount
9112249 to insist harper take immediate action to put inspectors on the floor of meat processing plants
9112250 to very quickly restore the confidence of canadians and more importantly to protect canadians
9112251 in the u s they had a legislated commitment to visit the plants daily
9112252 we took a different approach originally which meant that those tasks were applied by the inspectors spending more time in the plants though not necessarily on a daily basis
9112253 with our system we were able to pick it up with relatively small numbers otherwise it might have gone unnoticed
9112254 it helped us to connect the dots in such a way that we were able to say we have something provincially going on
9112255 some idiot decided for whatever reason they needed to paint a swastika and kkk all over my car
9112256 are treating this as a hate crime its disgusting and were trying to get to the bottom of who is behind it
9112257 now its almost three years to the day when that happened and it hits you that wow this could be happening again so we want to help out however we can
9112258 she went into shock last night when they had to tell her what happened
9112259 they answered her cell phone and told us to come to einstein
9112260 he was very energetic smart and just a burst of energy
9112261 he was a happy little kid and all the kids loved him
9112262 it was like magnets with them and when they had my nephew that was like life for them right there
9112263 we loyalists who make up the fan base called dinkytown can only hope that after defeating the niu mutts that coach brew ignores the urge
9112264 if you feel like youre a title contender its almost a death blow to lose that first game he said
9112265 i think its exciting to play nonconference games that are very meaningful people are excited to see em ohio state usc ohio state texas
9112266 ive made a statement that i would like to play a marquee nonconference game one time a year a game that really was significant that our guys got excited about playing
9112267 as they approached they noticed one of the males a 17 year old had what appeared to be the butt of a gun sticking from his waistband area
9112268 they ordered him not to move to drop it but as he reached for the firearm one officer discharged
9112269 but im not sure who told him to dress up
9112270 i feel like were in the beginning stages of being able to be to put our best foot forward
9112271 with our absolute best group that we can put out on the field
9112272 we have to deal with the reality of his knee not responding well right now
9112273 i dont know if we can afford as a team to keep him active unless he can predict that he can come through
9112274 i think hes going to have to play with some soreness
9112275 thats going to be a battle i think thats a very close battle
9112276 hes been a great part of this offense but were just evaluating and i thought stephon came in and did a pretty job
9112277 needs to continue to mature mentally in the passing game
9112278 thats the history of this offense basically is the passing game has been behind the run game the defense the special teams
9112279 and then as it comes on then you start hitting on all cylinders
9112280 we had the mentality that other teams got in three extra weeks of work so we had to catch up
9112281 regardless of whether we brought everyone back from last years team its still a different team
9112282 were building that right now i dont see anyone complacent or sitting on the fact we were super bowl champions last year
9112283 stray was kind of the face but a p was the leader every day at training camp
9112284 he has always been a vocal leader we have plenty of veteran guys stray left an imprint for sure even without him i am still going to envision him stomping someone out before every game
9112285 you have to move forward and you cant dwell on it
9112286 with the predictions and the opinions we could really care less those are the same people that last year told us we wouldnt do nothing
9112287 i think from a mental standpoint guys are even more focused than they were last year and ready to get off to a fast start
9112288 we just have to work hard on that and just be consistent week in and week out
9112289 i think that has been our motivation and we know we have to do that
9112290 it is always a good sign when it is a difficult time making decisions on the 53
9112291 so you always want to be in that position you dont ever want to see a player leave but you also want the positions to be highly competitive
9112292 your heart had to be in your mouth for matt
9112293 its real tough you try to just block it out but its coming
9112294 theyre going to have phone calls youre just nervous for 48 hours youre nervous did i do enough did i do this its nerve wracking
9112295 im going to try to take my kids to the park take my mind off of it
9112296 i think they have some really tough decisions to make
9112297 anytime theres any kind of conflict in any sport it makes it more interesting to watch as long as im not part of it i love it its fun to watch
9112298 its entertaining and gives you something else to think about besides just the race
9112299 i could have very easily drove off into turn three and doored him right in the left side quarterpanel and spun him out
9112300 i didnt do that i tried to race him clean i tried to get back by him and i got bogged down a little bit by denny hamlin who got along side of me
9112301 i never laid a tire mark on him hamlin and got back by him but it was just too late to try to run down carl
9112302 i would have certainly liked to have tried to not touch him i certainly would have not hit dale earnhardt jr at richmond
9112303 people always say all im doing is out there running into people and knock them out of the way but im not doing it on purpose im telling you
9112304 im not out there to try to move anybody i mean if i was a superstar at being able to move people out of the way i would have dumped junior at richmond and been able to win the race i didnt win the race so i looked like an idiot
9112305 it means you cant do anything like what you did last week again
9112306 its nascars discretion what they feel like would be the correct penalty to give a guy
9112307 i would say they did what they felt was right with the six weeks probation and it is what it is
9112308 i dont think it means that if you get into another driver and spin him out then youre going to get suspended for a race
9112309 were friends man i even joke around with guys with myself that carl is bf carl were best friends
9112310 i dont believe its a rivalry we can still be friends and have that relationship on the race track
9112311 i might text him later and well go get some in n out burgers
9112312 oh wait he doesnt eat that stuff i dont know maybe salads
9112313 i do remember having fresher tires and coming up through there
9112314 i dont remember touching but i guess if i did then thats the repercussions of bristol i guess is what i get
9112315 the first thing i think of when i look back at bristol is what happened in the spring of 2007 when i was racing with jeff burton
9112316 thats why i have the upmost respect for jeff burton
9112317 were here to race and the racing has been pretty good
9112318 no i dont worry about being on probation i just have to be a little extra careful not to let my emotions get the best of me
9112319 this was why god put the ticket in his hands
9112320 i was expecting five sets i was there for four and five but he wasnt there anymore
9112321 he is the biggest player for sure nadal is playing good tennis this year but for me federer is the best one
9112322 i dont think its affected a whole lot of matches i dont know how many times its saved a match because thats what its there for really but at the big tournaments at the big courts usually you have the best linespeople as well
9112323 the worst linespeople are usually on the outside courts where you need it more thats the problem with the system
9112324 as long as im doing the splits that means im healthy
9112325 when im not doing the splits you know theres something wrong
9112326 im not too sure about my body if i go into a split who knows if ill come back up
9112327 i wish i didnt have any drama in my matches i wish i would win nice and in a simple way
9112328 who likes drama do you know anybody that likes to get involved into tight matches
9112329 its not worse which is important now the thing is its not better either and it seems like the only way to repair it completely is arthroscopic surgery
9112330 my plan was to be part of the olympic games and i knew that if i suffered from pain they would have to operate
9112331 it was just one more step in the healing process
9112332 win or lose it didnt matter to me and i said that before the game i just wanted to make sure we honored the gfellers and matt and just played football and we will continue to do that the rest of the season
9112333 coach decided i would have to run more this game because last year they didnt key on me running the ball
9112334 i said whatever i had to do to win the game whatever it took and so thats what i did
9112335 it was definitely tough for me we consider them like family and we are pretty close willert and propst are like best friends and we are around each other a lot it was tough going to the funeral and all that and it was a real tough week for us
9112336 i think its a lot of healing for everybody tonight it was good to see the fan support the good showing it was a game we had to do it win lose whatever it was a tough win i am just worried about propst and the reynolds family and i hope they can keep it going
9112337 we have to really work and in practice the best time to improve is the first week to the second week
9112338 we didnt really have a week this week obviously so this will be our second week and we will try to improve greatly
9112339 i fully agree that the education system needs an overhaul
9112340 the problem with our system of education is the attitude of the people we are educating america has been wealthy for long enough that we have forgotten what made us wealthy in the first place and as our stomach for hard work and the discipline that necessarily accompanies it have eroded so too must our collective income if we wish to continue outpacing the incomes of such countries as china and india we must start by outperforming them
9112341 the students who were considered the most successful were those who could find clever ways to spit back to the teacher exactly what the teachers views were when i taught i tried to reward students who could come up with their own thoughts and analysis one of the surprising things i found was that the students who did well in most classes really struggled in mine because they werent used to having to operate independent of what i thought and the students who did well in my class were the ones who were struggling in the more traditional classes
9112342 in 1990 i believed computer technology was right at the tipping point for a revolution in education at that time it looked like a national voucher system would be implemented that would have been the vehicle that would have given innovators the ability to completely revolutionize education unfortunately teachers unions local public school initiatives etc killed the voucher idea
9112343 the sit still in rows educational behavior standard just doesnt fit many mostly boys at the risk of generalizing kids who have high energy most educators and many parents would rather turn to an adhd diagnosis and drugs than let a kid burn off a little energy with some freedom of movement
9112344 they have learned how jacks learning style is and adapted to it if only people in the it world were that adaptive wed see much more innovation
9112345 they were telling me they wanted a community like the one around apache
9112346 theres no point sitting around giving advice when suns marketing department will decide what it wants to distribute anyway
9112347 all things have been handed over to me by my father and no one knows the son except the father nor does anyone know the father except the son and anyone to whom the son wills to reveal him
9112348 come to me all who are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest
9112349 take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls 30

9112383 mccain declared as the pair stood together for the first time at a boisterous rally in ohio just days before the opening of the partys national convention
9112384 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9112385 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9112386 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9112387 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9112388 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9112389 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9112390 i spent as much time with cindy in washington and arizona as our jobs would allow
9112391 i was separated from carol but our divorce would not become final until february of 1980
9112392 you dont think romneys done much heavy lifting for america then
9112393 no i dont i think being senator uh a congressman uh a senator whatever it was a governor for four years and as far as the salt lake city thing hes a mormon and the mormons of salt lake city caused that scandal and to clean that up i its its not even again its not a subject
9112394 the views of my mother are not necessarily the views of mine
9112395 we have our differences with our democratic rivals but i believe in treating people with respect its why i dont refer to women as bitches even when i disagree with them im sure all of us believe we can debate the serious issues of the day without name calling and degrading language
9112396 at least i dont plaster on the makeup like a trollop you cunt
9112397 but the kids kept battling we came out aggressive in the second half which we didnt do in the first half and made some things happen
9112398 we had zero snaps experience at quarterback coming into the season so im glad derrick came in and had a good half
9112399 he is still kneeling before the coffin as his features begin to undergo the ravages of various obviously conflicting phases of feeling eyes mouth the whole facial structure is called upon to perform gruesome acrobatics of expression ultimately an impossible task is relieved or avoided by laughter the liberating laughter of an innocent derangement of a virgin madness voke rises to his feet by the powers of his idiotic hilarity he begins to move about in a weird dance hopping and bouncing and bobbing his laughter grows worse as he gyres aimlessly and his gestures become more convulsive through complete lack of attention or perhaps by momentarily regaining it voke makes his way out of the loft and is now laughing into the dark abyss beyond the precarious railing at the top of the crooked stairway his final laugh seems to stick in his throat he goes over the railing and falls without a sound his baggy clothes flapping uselessly thus the screams you now hear are not those of the plummeting voke neither are they the screams of cheev who is long gone nor the supernatural echoes of prena and lamms cries of horror these screams the ones from beyond the door at the top of the stairs belong only to a dummy who now feels warm drops of blood sliding thickly over his lacquered cheeks and who has been left alone and alive in the shadows of an abandoned loft and his eyes are rolling like mad marbles
9112400 what does it mean to be alive except to court disaster and suffering at every moment
9112401 i asked you if you knew really knew why hes called the can
9112402 he pretends hes a garbage can he eats he eats whatever you put in his mouth he swallows it and begs for more
9112403 do me a favor and move a little closer to mr can
9112404 closer still kerrie right up against his body as if you were riding him piggy back there thats close enough
9112405 youre right about mr can he does eat whatever you or someone like you puts in his mouth but he also eats other things hes not just a garbage can kerrie what you never knew about mr can is that not only does he have a secret life that he lives out in places like this he also has a secret secret life that he would never have told you about by night hes the human garbage can you know but probably do not love in an even darker night of his soul mr can is hes well theres just no subtle way i can say this hes a cannibal and soon youre going to be made one with him your brain buried inside of his brain your nervous system integrated into his and your desires bound to his desires unfortunately you will be denied all muscular control youll exist something like a parasite organism inside him a tapeworm if you like but he wont be bothered by you hell continue to eat as youve always known him to eat and you will know that you are eating the same things he will also eat as you never knew him to eat there are others like him and he is in league with them mostly they consume homeless persons who have fallen unnoticed by the wayside sometimes they give them a little help in their going on rare occasions they eat living food are you aware of the word that cannibals who once occupied islands in the south pacific used for human being it translates as the food that talks mr can and others of his kind live to eat i know that was never your style kerrie but from now on it will be as long as mr can lives and you know what hes even made special preparations with his fellow cannibals for the day when he will be too dead to chew his food it seems to be their desire dont ask me why that after their demise they be buried naked in secret ground after their life of eating is over their final wish is to become food for other forms of life its rather spiritual dont you think the great circle of being and all that of course just because mr can is dead doesnt necessarily mean that youll join him youre so much younger so much healthier even given your anorexic mania than he is im guessing that the little parasite inside him will outlive his body by a certain term although i cant say how long that will be can you still hear me kerrie youre sliding down into him so fast its almost as if you cant wait to get inside prick up your ears if youd like to hear more
9112406 what does it mean to be alive except to court disaster and suffering at every moment
9112407 i spent the rest of the day devising a very special costume and the appropriate face to go with it i easily shabbied up my overcoat with a torn pocket or two and a complete set of stains combined with blue jeans and a pair of rather scuffed up shoes i had a passable costume for a derelict the face however was more difficult for i had to experiment from memory conjuring a mental image of the screaming pierrot in that painting the scream i now recall helped me quite a bit at nightfall i exited the hotel by the back stairway it was strange to walk down the crowded street in this gruesome disguise though i thought i would feel conspicuous the actual experience was very close i imagined to one of complete invisibility no one looked at me as i strolled by or as they strolled by or as we strolled by each other i was a phantom perhaps the ghost of festivals past or those yet to come
9112408 what does it mean to be alive except to court disaster and suffering at every moment
9112409 what does it mean to be alive except to court disaster and suffering at every moment
9112410 shes going to learn national security at the foot of the master for the next four years and

9112431 so what are your big plans for this long weekend
9112432 a majority of the models have the storm moving towards the southwest
9112433 but florida is not out of the woods by any means where it is going to go remains uncertain
9112434 gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9112435 i dont even want to hear about iran i dont want to hear about weapons of mass destruction or what theyre building or whatever in fact ive got to tell you and honestly and if anybody wants to be honest and they asked themselves this question if the iranians had invaded canada and mexico the way we invaded afghanistan and iraq both sides of iran if we were under the same situation i think keith you and i would join in on building whatever we could to defend ourselves against these two armies that would be on both of our borders i mean its just crazy and i think were going to have more of the same
9112436 it said to whom it may concern charles couldnt be at work because his daughter had to have a heart transplant
9112437 by her being on that berlin heart it saved her life
9112438 it bought us more time you can live on a berlin heart over 365 days while we were waiting on a heart
9112439 i tried to not let this overcome me because i knew i had a job to do and i had a season coming up
9112440 im not going to lie it was hard some days i would sit in my room and just think what am i doing here i would feel guilty for being at work and not being at the hospital with my kid i had those days
9112441 as far as camp and football and things like that i told charles if he felt like coming to practice come to practice but take care of his family and go from there
9112442 were just glad that it seems like its going to have a happy ending
9112443 you talk about real men and being a father and husband ive had a chance to see him go through a lot of different things and he just stepped up to the plate
9112444 my wife would get on these blog sites and stuff like that and people were wondering why i wasnt at practice
9112445 someone said i was getting traded for brett favre one blog said i hit my wife and one blog said i got arrested for drinking and driving it was a bunch of crazy stuff
9112446 i think probably the toughest thing that i had to battle with and i still battle with it now is that i knew in order for my daughter to live another kid had to die
9112447 the biggest thing that i got out of it is youre taking something negative and making it into a positive instead of having just two negatives
9112448 americans should not be forced to choose between getting care and living independent and productive lives
9112449 we will take steps to ensure that our seniors have meaningful long term care options
9112450 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
9112451 all of us at showtime wish david and his family the best during this very private time
9112452 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
9112453 we had a nice 90 yard drive but didnt do much offensively or defensively in the first two periods
9112454 our offense started clicking and looked the best it has this year in the second half
9112455 it looked good to look out there and see if moving the ball executing the offense
9112456 he was a big factor in our offensive execution in the second half
9112457 he settled down and ran the offense the offense and the defense really looked good in the second half
9112458 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page if anyone has any questions id be happy to answer them as best i can if anyone has any comments im glad to listen
9112459 i have a fairly specific idea of what the first 15 pages of the screenplay will be and no idea what will happen on pages 16 through 130 i have very strong feelings about the internet and its effect on our national culture but frankly those feelings are being countered by the sophistication kindness curiosity and wit of the posts in this site
9112460 i have a fairly specific idea of what the first 15 pages of the screenplay will be and no idea what will happen on pages 16 through 130
9112461 we are two weeks in and our goal has been to get better each day and tonight was a great test of character against one of the top teams in the country at their home opener
9112462 it was a great crowd and great atmosphere we have our heads held high i thought the performance was excellent tonight
9112463 we came to compete tonight and i think we made sure we didnt expose ourselves early and when we won the ball we kept possession pretty well and attacked as a unit and created some good openings
9112464 i think we tired late in the first half and we didnt capitalize on our openings so they came into the game a little bit and they put people forward and tried to go at us and we were resilient at the end of the first half
9112465 and were outraged by illegal warrantless wiretapping by bushist minions
9112466 this means it can spot names or numbers that crop up alongside anyone already of interest to the authorities and then catalogue any documents that contain such associates
9112467 as a tool to help the security services tackle crime and terrorism
9112468 authorized groups need to have direct access to communications between suspects whether it is individuals groups or organizations only then can they take appropriate action detect prevent and anticipate crimes and guarantee peace and security
9112469 from nontraditional sources such as public safety entities and private sector organizations
9112470 to anticipate identify prevent and or monitor criminal and terrorist activity
9112471 a vast database of names that feeds the nations terrorist watch list
9112472 would actually be less capable than the u s government terrorist tracking system it is meant to replace
9112473 the program appears to be on the brink of collapse after an estimated half billion dollars in taxpayer funding has been spent on it
9112474 technical flaws hinder terrorist watch list congress calls for investigation
9112475 recent weeks the government has fired most of the 862 private contractors from dozens of companies working on the railhead project and only a skeleton crew remains
9112476 calls to officials of boeing and sri were not immediately returned
9112477 currently there are no good patterns available to recognise terrorists he says and questions whether siemens has got around this
9112478 for a moratorium on the development of fusion technologies referring explicitly to the siemens intelligence platform
9112479 the efficiency and reliability of such tools is as yet unknown more surveillance does not necessarily lead to a higher level of societal security hence there must be a thorough examination of whether the resulting massive constraints on human rights are proportionate and justified
9112480 no importa si me apoyaron o apoyaron a barack ahora debemos unirnos como un solo partido con un solo prop sito esta lucha es por el futuro y es una lucha que tenemos que ganar barack obama es mi candidato y debe ser nuestro presidente
9112481 hilary dijo ayer de una manera inequ voca que har lo posible para que obama salga elegido en noviembre este compromiso es de los dos ovaci n estruendosa cuando fui candidato los republicanos me acusaban de ser muy joven para ser comandante en jefe les suena familiar no les funcion entonces porque est bamos del lado apropiado de la historia y no les va a funcionar ahora porque barack obama est del lado correcto de la historia est listo para hacer el trabajo
9112482 esto no me lo pod a perder juntos hemos conocido el xito y el fracaso pero nunca hemos perdido nuestra fe en que estamos llamados a mejorar nuestro pa s y a vivir en un mundo nuevo obama cerrar por fin el libro de la vieja pol tica
9112483 esposa que ama a su marido y est convencida de que ser un extraordinario presidente
9112484 el cambio comienza en la base no en la c spide
9112485 acepto la candidatura a la presidencia de los estados unidos
9112486 ya basta de los viejos postulados de los republicanos nosotros medimos el progreso por el n mero de empleos y el monto de los ingresos de las familias no por el numero de millonarios y las ganancias de las grandes empresas
9112487 reflejan la preocupaci n creciente entre las grandes empresas de que un movimiento sindical revitalizado por una victoria dem crata pueda revertir a os de merma en la afiliaci n gremial
9112488 we had a witness who was able to give us a very detailed description of the van
9112489 were hoping if there is a young person involved wed hope theyre in over their head and would approach an adult they know and trust and not compound things for themselves
9112490 the entire matter is under investigation and that is something that is being looked at
9112491 the girl had confided in their son that the defendant had raped her when she was 11 years old and that the defendant was very jealous of their sons relationship with
9112492 the defendant directed the girl to say she found a cup of his sperm on the counter to be taken to the clinic for a surrogate mother
9112493 the defendant ended the letter by saying if you say this if you go to court thin thay can not do nothing
9112494 tried to fight back but the defendant held her down so she could not move
9112495 the girls mother took the girls to have abortions each time she learned they were pregnant
9112496 she did not know the defendant was the father of her daughters babies

9112498 i used to fish with this retired surgeon who had a tuna boat when he was younger
9112499 he told me dont ever go tuna fishing because youll be obsessed

9112513 it is clear the city auditor has become a political lapdog in return for favors granted to him by the council president instead of serving the city as a whole he has consistently ignored best practices in auditing which are supposed to bring about greater efficiency in government
9112514 i am quite certain that the other council members are unfamiliar with the extent of the private relationship between the auditor and the council president
9112515 earlier this week i spoke with and sent a letter to the auditor confirming that the city had satisfactorily responded to 53 of the 54 recommendations in the 2007 report and the auditor agreed the other recommendation will be complied with by september 19 2008
9112516 i specifically asked the auditor to include our responses in the final report i thought that he would have done so but he chose not to include the corrections weve already made to improve the efficiency of fleet operations
9112517 i only learned of the issuance of the final report through the media which unfortunately reported the inaccurate information supplied by the auditor

9112576 language not only reflects womens social position but can be used to challenge it
9112577 sexist language is not just about the words used to describe women but also how they are used and to what ends

9112741 i thought the first 20 minutes of the game were absolutely stunning with the one touch passing from us creating some great looks at goal and i think thing were looking good to begin
9112742 you give our opponents credit for fighting back with passion and energy
9112743 that got them back in the game after that it was a scrappy game and it suited our opponents better by the end i think that deserved to win because they fought for it
9112744 we had a shot off the post and one off someones shin
9112745 the goal they scored was a deflected shot so thats soccer on a different day it could be a different score but the only score that matters is that they scored one and we didnt
9112746 ill be curious to see how this young team responds we certainly put a lot of energy in to this game and we werent able to match our opponent are we going to be better than that against oral roberts well just wait and see what happens
9112747 there is no doubt we are a better team now then two and a half weeks ago
9112748 this was a great opportunity to start the season in a great environment we were able to evaluate measure and address our weakness tonight
9112749 we came out ready to go in the second game
9112750 and got them out of system but we kinds of relaxed a bit and you cant do that against good teams especially at home
9112751 we have to learn to maintain that level of intensity and keep up the defensive pressure we also have to limit our unforced errors overall i was pleased with the night and im glad to have a match under our belts

9112763 the minister seems to have trouble getting on top of this portfolio hes had trouble with the gravy train affair go card he does not really know much is what going on in his portfolio

9112767 i think the government should come clean and tell us what government owned corporations are doing tonight and how much they are spending and whether they are really focused on delivering services for taxpayers or good times for bureaucrats

9112914 the purpose of the free software foundation fsf is probably obvious from its name but what does promoting free software mean in terms of everyday activity examining the roles of the organization shows how complex the fsfs advocacy role has become it also reveals the range of services available to the free software community and helps to explain how such a small group has had such a major influence on computer technology as a 501 c 3 charity in the united states the fsf is run by a board of directors the current board includes fsf founder and president richard m stallman and long term member henry poole but in the last few years new faces have appeared on the board
9112915 hot on the heels of its denials that anything is wrong with the g92 and g94s comes another pcn product change notification that shows the g92s and g92b are being changed for no reason yup the problems that are plaguing g84 and g86 are the same that affect seemingly all 65nm and now 55nm nvidia parts it is hard to overstate how bad this is basically every 65nm and 55nm nvidia part appears to be defective we are hearing of early failure rates in the teens percent for 8800gts and far higher for 9600gts to make matters worse nvidia has a mound of unsold defective parts that they are going to bleed out into the channel along side of the hopefully fixed parts as a buyer you have no way of knowing which one you are getting until nvidia comes fully clean on this fiasco lists all the defective parts and orders boxes clearly marked you cant say anything other than just avoid them then again since doing the right thing would likely bankrupt them we wouldnt hold your breath for it to happen
9112916 before they ship pcs to retailers like best buy computer makers load them up with lots of free software for 30 best buy will get rid of it for you that simple cleanup service is threatening the precarious economics of the personal computer industry software companies pay hundreds of millions of dollars to pc makers like hewlett packard to install their photo tools financial programs and other products usually with some tie in to a paid service or upgrade with margins growing thinner than most laptops this critical revenue can make the difference between profit and loss for the computer makers industry analysts say
9112917 smart coders always optimize the slowest thing but what if the slowest thing is the code supplied by your vendor that was exactly the situation vipul ved prakash discovered when he tinkered with a company linux box on which perl code was running at least 100 times slower than expected the code he found was running on centos linux using perl packages built by red hat so prakash got rid of the perl executable that came with centos compiled a new one from stock and the bug disappeared whats more disturbing mcallister writes is that this red hat perl performance issue is a known bug first documented in 2006 on red hats own bugzilla database folks affected by the current bug have two options sit tight or compile the perl interpreter from source effectively waiving your support contract if a linux vendor cant provide comprehensive maintenance and support for the open source software projects you depend on mcallister asks who ever will

9112921 weve long thought that nuclear decay rates are constant regardless of ambient conditions except in a few special cases where beta decay can be influenced by powerful electric fields so that makes it hard to explain two puzzling experiments from the 1980s that found periodic variations over many years in the decay rates of silicon 32 and radium 226 now a new analysis of the raw data says that changes in the decay rate are synchronized with each other and with earths distance from the sun the physicists behind this work offer two theories to explain why this might be happening abstract first some theorists think the sun produces a field that changes the value of the fine structure constant on earth as its distance from the sun varies that would certainly affect the rate of nuclear decay another idea is that the effect is caused by some kind of interaction with the neutrino flux from the suns interior which also varies with distance take your pick what makes the whole story even more intriguing is that for years physicists have disagreed over the decay rates of several isotopes such as titanium 44 silicon 32 and cesium 137 perhaps they took their data at different times of the year
9112922 according to a thread on the bind users mailing list there is nothing inherent in the dns protocol that would cause the massive vulnerability discussed at length here and elsewhere as it turns out it appears to be a simple off by one error in bind which favors new ns records over cached ones even if the cached ttl is not yet expired the patch changes this in favor of still valid cached records removing the attackers ability to successfully poison the cache outside the small window of opportunity afforded by an expiring ttl which is the way things used to be before the kaminsky debacle source port randomization is nice but removing the root cause of the attacks effectiveness is better
9112923 what gabriel suggests is interesting and was considered but a doesnt work and b creates fatal reliability issues ive responded in a post here
9112924 the online hitman scammer who threatens to kill recipients if they do not pay thousands of dollars to the sender is still sending out thousands of emails and the fbi is again today warning users to ignore the spam and report any incidents to the internet crime complaint center two new versions of the scheme began appearing in july 2008 the fbi said one instructed the recipient to contact a telephone number contained in the e mail and the other claimed the recipient or a loved one was going to be kidnapped unless a ransom was paid
9112925 the bbc has published a very good profile of gary mckinnon it discusses his motives and methods as well as raising the question as to whether he is a malicious hacker or whether he was simply obsessed with finding info about ufos and should be praised for finding security faults in what should be extremely secure systems this should provided stimulus for some interesting discussion on slashdot especially between us brits and our american friends following the confirmation of his extradition to the usa
9112926 its just an accident waiting to happen as long as those planes are flying over our homes
9112927 theyre just so low i feel like i can reach up there and touch the plane
9112928 its just like what happened basically at north las vegas if you dont have enough altitude you cant get to a safe place to put an airplane down with a catastrophic failure
9112929 if they dont get those airplanes off the top of our homes its not a matter of if its just when
9112930 they ask them over at the airport as a courtesy to fly to st rose parkway before heading east or west what youre seeing is those planes take off and when they get to the end of the runway theyre still approximately a mile from st rose parkway and they start making their turn and that is directly over the top of our homes
9112931 you can actually see their faces and its a real concern for me for the safety and welfare of our community
9112932 we have no fear of making all the bits available
9112933 stumbled on a model that endorses differentiation by all vendors
9112934 the tech rally into the back half of the year will probably be more muted than other years
9112935 what could be better than buying growth stocks at a no growth multiple
9112936 i dont think this is a market where you get paid to be a hero
9112937 the problem will be if our dollar starts rising and the economy does not rally i do think theres a danger of that happening
9112938 since most commodity prices have corrected sharply over the last 2 months it suggests inflationary pressures should continue to subside
9112939 the fed might be able to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy the prospects for tech and growth stocks does look better
9112940 if a technology company doesnt have a new product coming out it could languish in this economy
9112941 eso fue lo que debieron haber hecho desde un principio y no tratar de dar la impresi n de que el presidente del pnp luis fortu o es un l der fuerte y decidido atropellando los debidos procesos de ley que deben existir en toda organizaci n
9112942 apenas faltan cinco d as laborables para que se tengan que imprimir las papeletas y por lo que veo las papeletas se van a imprimir con de castro font como candidato
9112943 amortiguar los da os a los que se expuso al entrar en esos dimes y diretes con de castro font si no tomaba acci n y lo dejaba en el aire se pod a plantear una cosa de debilidad si tomaba la acci n de expulsarlo permit a que de castro siguiera tirando con lo que tiene
9112944 atiende el elemento de la precipitaci n que se hab a planteado al principio para no provocar que de castro font siga disparando porque a n no hay una decisi n final y espera a ver si los federales act an y hay una acusaci n formal con la que el pnp puede actuar
9112945 esto es un du rmete nene con la esperanza de que el fbi negociado federal de investigaciones act e a la brevedad posible y radique cargos en contra del senador para que ah se haga acad mico que el senador tenga que renunciar
9112946 if these services are privatised the next time you get your bill it will be from a private operator and people can be assured that the prices contained in those bills will go up
9112947 i hope i only miss a couple of weeks but the bigger picture is i want to be out there at the end of the year i dont want to rip it up im going to be smart listen to what mike and the trainers say coming back right now wouldnt be smart

9112949 i dont trust anybody more than i trust him dr andrews when it comes to stuff like that just to go down there and hear it from him its something i needed to do just to clear my mind he said my ligament looked fine thats what i was afraid of it was a big relief
9112950 temos uma tima rela o com a venezuela e n o vemos que valor agregado poder amos obter neste momento com uma integra o formal
9112951 o equador jamais excluiu a possibilidade de no futuro fazer parte do alba
9112952 n s precisamos do equador mas respeitamos a liberdade de cada pa s
9112953 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before
9112954 have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun
9112955 i waited until the last minute to find a girl to ask to the prom and all the good ones had better things to do and turned me down
9112956 people see some of the things i do and they say why dont you show this to the world people dont know you do these things and maybe i will
9112957 that meant very much to me and seemed to be received so beautifully by the public and the world you know i enjoyed it very much
9112958 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9112959 i am letting them enjoy their childhood as much as possible i let them go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things i think that comes naturally i want them to get to do things i didnt get to do
9112960 i get pretty emotional when i see them having a wonderful time
9112961 coming to the knicks and hopefully being able to contribute means a lot to me
9112962 it has always been my dream to play for this team my goal is to show the coaches that i can play and do all that i can to help the team win some games
9112963 i am very happy my son will follow in my footsteps
9112964 hopefully he will have a long and productive career in new york i am proud of him and wish him nothing but success
9112965 patrick ewing will have an opportunity here to compete for a spot on our roster
9112966 he is a solid defensive player and a very good athlete
9112967 every day they threaten me and want to drive me out of ossetia
9112968 you can see were surrounded by pipes some are conical shapes some are straight pipes smallest ones are just a few inches the largest ones in this section are up to 16 feet
9112969 it would have been people with a bellows people pressing to keep the pressure up
9112970 your music elevates us beyond the noise of modern life to another dimension elevates the soul
9112971 youre in your own world its me the organ and the lord
9112972 i have felt like a bird with broken wings falling into a deep valley
9112973 instead the party issued a statement praising him for courageously confessing his wrongdoing
9112974 we have taken this decision after we failed to find any ray of hope and none of the commitments made to us were fulfilled by pakistan peoples party ppp co chairman asif ali zardari
9112975 this situation has forced us to withdraw our support and sit on the opposition benches
9112976 its basically the equivalent of a midnight raid behind enemy lines
9112977 hillary said she made 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling well mccain just shattered it
9112978 the early feminists worked for the rights of women to vote and our right to life
9112979 this is one more step in a long march for womens history
9112980 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9112981 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9112982 governor palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade they both want to continue the failed economic policies of the bush administration and they both offer more of the same that has led this country down the wrong path
9112983 mccain clearly sees the power of women voters in this election but has just as clearly failed to support any of the issues that they care about
9112984 a member of the radical anti choice org feminists for life
9112985 shines a light on these issues more sharply than if he had picked just another guy
9112986 if people give you a shelter you should take it
9112987 weve taken in all the balcony furniture all the pool furniture the marquees tied up what needs to be tied up cut down any coconuts
9112988 its not the fire department causing the deficit we already made our cuts
9112989 my rough guess is about 40 minutes for me to get someone else to help
9112990 it took an entire year but when you close stations youre rolling the dice
9112991 one eye on the budget and the other eye on the services
9112992 what has happened to this airline ive never seen such disorganization how could they not have planes or pilots or crew when they have booked flights
9112993 oh no what do you think you need to feel better
9112994 this country allowed katrina to happen this country allowed the disaster to occur and they allowed people to be displaced
9112995 we not only march for the people of new orleans we march for those in chinatown we march for those in the lower east side we march for those who have been priced out in harlem we march for those whose homes have been bulldozed in new delhi
9112996 its important to remember it especially since a lot of the people who survived are still unable to return to their homes those that have them and those that dont are unable to go back to new orleans at all especially is they are people of color
9112997 this is not just a guy walking out of his role as a fireman or policeman these guys are special individuals that have trained throughout the years to be in this position
9112998 the experience that we gained from katrina deploying as a team is really going to bring us up so much more prepared and ready for this deployment
9112999 as far as the article is concerned i think this thread speaks for itself as to why atheist are viewed the way they are
9113000 unlike some i dont post in every single religious thread speak negatively preach put people down about their beliefs and call them ignorant try to make people feel stupid write an entire book in posts in attempts to get my point across quote
9113001 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
9113002 i feel sorry for people that have no faith but id rather spend my time more productively elsewher e
9113003 saya pikir mengejar ketertinggalan poin dengan kondisi seperti ini mungkin saja dilakukan dengan pembalap lain tapi dengan valentino rossi itu nyaris tak mungkin
9113004 kami masih memiliki enam balapan tersisa dan kondisi ini yang harus kami hadapi sekarang beberapa balapan terakhir berkesudahan dengan mengecewakan terutama yang terakhir itu memberi valentino jarak yang lebar dan cuma masalah waktu sebelum kami merasakan kekecewaan
9113005 yang bisa kami lakukan adalah memberikan yang terbaik di balapan balapan terakhir tak ada lagi yang bisa kami lakukan selain itu
9113006 the objective of this guide is to provide teachers with specific recommendations that can be carried out in the classroom without requiring systemic change other school personnel having direct contact with students such as coaches counselors and principals will also find the guide useful
9113007 this practice guide was developed by an expert panel convened by the institute of education sciences
9113008 it was described to me like a suburban city crowded with sheep and horses and having a strong dialect
9113009 i found that wow the people are really friendly here
9113010 theyve found me a bicycle furniture and kitchen utensils my mother and girlfriend are so happy that people on the other side of the world have been so nice to me they feel very thankful
9113011 id like to share what i think are a few of my successful teaching methods and practices
9113012 it is interesting now how much more americans know and are interested in china
9113013 we have changed but american perception has too which i think is very good for both countries
9113014 i hear that many foreign language classes in the u s are focused on food games and songs and that for example many american students talk in class or will be doing their makeup
9113015 im going to expect the same kind of thing that i expect from my chinese students in one year
9113016 i want them to know this is something serious and interesting and if they work hard they can be fluent
9113017 there are differences because in china we are focused on the total number of medals and whether we beat america and here its all about the individual the michael phelps
9113018 but there are also similarities i see how much each country does to welcome its friends from other places
9113019 there is a chinese saying it is our pleasure to welcome friends from far away
9113020 that is what we want to do and that is what i see here on the inside we are both proud of our countries and on the outside we want to be friendly
9113021 we want to make sure we get projects that are ready to go in 2009
9113022 saya ingin menegaskan bahawa kerajaan barisan nasional bn yang diberi mandat oleh rakyat pada bulan mac lalu akan terus memelihara kestabilan politik dan meningkatkan kemakmuran negara
9113023 usaha pihak tertentu yang cuba menggugat kestabilan ini dengan merampas kuasa secara tidak sah tanpa mandat majoriti rakyat perlu ditolak saya tidak akan membenarkan gangguan ini diteruskan saya tidak akan membenarkan mandat rakyat dirampas daripada barisan nasional yang telah menang majoriti pilihan raya umum secra sah dan mengikut lunas demokrasi
9113024 rakyat tidak akan dimakmurkan dan negara tidak dapat dibangunkan hanya dengan retorik politik
9113025 budaya berpolitik yang keterlaluan merugikan setiap kita malah menjejaskan kemakmuran negara
9113026 saya ingin menegaskan bahawa kerajaan barisan nasional yang diberi mandat
9113027 usaha pihak tertentu yang cuba menggugat kestabilan ini dengan merampas kuasa secara tidak sah tanpa mandat majoriti rakyat perlu ditolak
9113028 sedikit sebanyak ia akan memberi kesan negatif kepada pelabur asing sentimen ekonomi dan juga pasaran modal
9113029 saya tidak akan membenarkan mandat rakyat dirampas daripada parti barisan nasional yang telah menang majoriti pilihan raya umum secara sah dan mengikut lunas demokrasi
9113030 saya yakin rakyat akan terus memberi sokongan kepada kerajaan barisan nasional untuk melaksanakan tugas tugas mentadbir negara
9113031 we need to get on with the business of governing and not waste any more time with opportunistic threats to seize the peoples mandate through undemocratic means dengan izin
9113032 the interest from the press in the conventions is markedly different
9113033 if people do come to the twin cities its out of journalistic integrity its like a check the box thing
9113034 theres a danger i think of a little bit of obama mania particularly overseas
9113035 we have to be careful to make sure that our coverage is balanced both in content and in volume
9113036 there are so many people to talk to and there is never any shortage of things to do you just look at every assignment as a puzzle that needs to be solved you sit down with your scratch pad and figure it out
9113037 i more than suspect that the mccain campaign want their people energized by the fact that theyre fighting a battle against the media
9113038 i read conservative blog sites they are up in arms about this coverage and i think thats going to be part of the dialogue
9113039 the audience probably knows most of the things we could tell them about obama by the time he gets to the stadium
9113040 they wont know that much about mccain because they werent listening even if we were telling them this is an opportunity for us to basically fill in the blanks and lets face it hes got a pretty compelling story himself
9113041 its going to be a substantive convention and i dont think were going to have any problem getting people to want to watch it
9113042 ive been doing conventions since 1980 and ive never seen anything like this
9113043 this is a state of the art modern sports arena so its great for television and has everything you want especially with the wide concourses open to the lower bowl
9113044 the media end up in two thirds or three fourths of the actual real estate thats used for the convention
9113045 one of the great things about doing this every four years is to drop in and see the advances in communication technology
9113046 we have a detailed production schedule listing when everything gets done from the podium to the lights to the decorations
9113047 it all falls into place the last week so were ready

9113050 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
9113051 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
9113052 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
9113053 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
9113054 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
9113055 trying to be voice of community to bring people in and engage people who feel a digital divide who feel excluded from technology our core user group

9113057 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
9113058 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
9113059 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
9113060 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
9113061 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
9113062 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
9113063 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
9113064 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
9113065 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
9113066 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
9113067 and i didnt get into that room because i was a woman i didnt go up to my fellow representatives and tell them to vote for me because im a woman i did it by doing the best job i could possibly do and letting my work speak for me they chose me based on what id done and on what i promised to do

9113070 the game started out pretty chaotic with the weather but we came out strong like always and this time we actually scored
9113071 it was an intense game on both sides with both of the coaches and the players
9113072 we had to match that intensity and it made it that much more exciting to come out with the win scoring three goals was great especially after scoring only one goal in two games and we hope this opens the offense up for us
9113073 we were a much better soccer team in the second half
9113074 we held the ball and kept the pressure on them we survived it and were in first place in the big 12
9113075 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store

9113083 pertama aku mengangkat tiga jari ku sebagai lambang trinitas dia merespon dengan mengangkat satu jarinya untuk mengingatkanku bahwa tetap hanya ada satu tuhan untuk kedua agama kami kemudian aku membentuk lingkaran di sekelilingku yang menunjukkan bahwa tuhan ada di sekitar kita dia membalasnya dengan menunjuk ke tanah dan menunjukkan bahwa tuhan juga sekarang ada bersama kita aku mengeluarkan sebuah wafer dan segelas anggur menunjukkan bahwa tuhan akan menebus dosa dosa kita dia kemudian mengeluarkan sebutir apel untuk mengingatkanku akan dosa awal umat manusia dia memiliki jawaban atas segalanya apa yang dapat aku lakukan
9113084 pertama dia mengatakan padaku bahwa bangsa yahudi memiliki 3 hari untuk pergi dari sini aku katakan padanya bahwa tidak satu orang pun dari kita yang akan pergi kemudian dia mengatakan padaku bahwa seluruh kota akan dibersihkan dari bangsa yahudi kemudian aku tegaskan kepada mereka bahwa kita akan tetap tinggal disini
9113085 saya rela hidup dan mencintai jika kematian adalah raja daripada hidup abadi tapi didalamnya tanpa cinta
9113086 dikampus cinta kita adalah keberuntungan yang dipilih seseorang andre mauris

9113093 the accepted way to speak about america is in the voice that disrespects it and the voice thats unacceptable is the one that loves america

9113095 before somers town there was the industrial film unit british transport films whose excellence suggests that a film made entirely to promote the buying of train tickets can be as interesting if not more than someones untrammelled creative vision somers town tries to have it both ways it certainly doesnt announce itself as a eurostar film or anything so vulgar nonetheless its all pretty obvious the new terminal is contantly mentioned and the final scenes in paris in glorious technicolour lay it on very thick as an argument for travel it works very well and is a rare statement against anti east european racism about a third of the film is in polish and for a british cosmopolitanism its funny sweet and very slight and by far the most irritating thing about it is the appalling david gray mike and the mechanics esque soundtrack all soulful heartwarming crooning over the over signposted epiphanies oh for a british film that doesnt aspire to warming the sodding cockles
9113096 this sort of animal house as political campaign is probably the only aspect of mccains operation thats close in spirit to mccains appealing 2000 run theres a wonderful essay by david foster wallace in consider the lobster that captures the freewheeling insurgent vibe of the straight talk express read it and weep at whats become of mr maverick and this impulsiveness speaks to mccain himself a man of many virtues but whose disqualifying personal flaw is that he makes decisions on the fly often as a gut reaction to a provocation the choice of sarah palin it seems is another product of mccains impulsive reactive decision making and the thinking of a campaign thats effective in staying afloat primarily by being good at feeding the news media mccain surely punkd obama for a news cycle or two and hell succeed in generating some excitement leading up to next week but for what

9113108 oh shit how have i not reviewed this place yet
9113109 what about the one place with the really good burgers in that fancy type neighborhood
9113110 i asked for six innings and i got exactly what i asked for
9113111 he did what he had to do he went out there and he made pitches
9113112 its good to go out there every fifth game and feel good
9113113 im not exactly going out there and being totally dominant
9113114 after all his injuries to be able to get two wins this year i think he feels pretty good
9113115 all these remaining games were doing what we have to do
9113116 just the one pitch where the first run scored that was not where i wanted it
9113117 its getting to the point in the season where were heading into september and he seems to have a lot left
9113118 we didnt hit we didnt play defense and we didnt pitch
9113119 weve had a lot of 10 day road trips this year
9113120 to not have anymore to be done with them is definitely nice
9113121 i dont think that just reaching that number in and of itself has that much meaning
9113122 we were up 4 0 and it was nice just to put a little stamp on it especially with the way dice k had been pitching
9113123 he didnt seem like a guy that would be mad
9113124 i worry more about pedroia than i do about big papi right now

9113145 im sure if you play long enough youre going to
9113146 guys have been giving me a hard time all year about not having a walkoff
9113147 i go around and ive got to listen to it every time we go into extra innings now i guess theyll have to pick something else
9113148 it never crossed my mind it was going out of the park
9113149 they could grab somebody out of the stands and he could throw a good game against us it seems like everybody they run out there every time is tough
9113150 i happened to make one bad pitch and it cost us the lead
9113151 i was telling the guys i remember the day when i was able to hit and field my position so i dont know whats going on
9113152 we didnt score early but we scored when the team needed it the most
9113153 i was thinking i just need to come through right here and at least tie the game
9113154 i knew it was going to be gone and i was happy because this is a team we really need to beat
9113155 theyre playing good baseball and i screwed it up my last few outings have been horrible
9113156 we keep the team in the game because we understand we have a really good offense
9113157 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9113158 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9113159 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9113160 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti

9113167 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9113168 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

9113171 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9113172 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
9113173 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni

9113175 no allingresso nel pdl e con il pd dialogo in parlamento

9113177 con profonda gratitudine e grande umilt accetto la nomination per la presidenza degli stati uniti
9113178 a john mccain sta a cuore lamerica il problema che non capisce
9113179 che ciascuno di noi libero di vivere come vuole ma che abbiamo anche lobbligo di trattaci lun laltro con dignit e rispetto
9113180 in quando commander in chief non esiter mai a difendere questa nazione ma invier le truppe solo con una missione chiara e il sacro impegno a fornir loro quanto necessario durante la battaglia e le cure e i benefici che meritano una volta tornati a casa

9113182 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9113183 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9113184 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9113185 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9113186 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9113187 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9113188 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica
9113189 una riforma organica che non sia rivolta contro qualcuno ma guardi agli interessi dei cittadini

9113193 la scuola ha detto deve rimettere al centro la persona e preparare i ragazzi ad essere cittadini consapevoli dei diritti e dei doveri e conoscitori dei principi costituzionali
9113194 crediamo che alla scuola serva chiarezza ha spiegato il ministro per questo ci sar un ritorno dei voti accompagnati dai giudizi che saranno esplicativi del risultato raggiunto dai ragazzi
9113195 il consiglio dei ministri ha espresso parere favorevole in merito al ritorno al maestro unico per la scuola primaria ha detto il ministro il provvedimento sar contenuto nel piano programmatico per la scuola contenuto nella finanziaria e su cui stiamo lavorando con il ministro tremonti
9113196 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9113197 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9113198 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9113199 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9113200 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9113201 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9113202 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale
9113203 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9113204 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese

9113207 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9113208 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9113209 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9113210 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9113211 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9113212 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9113213 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9113214 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9113215 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
9113216 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema
9113217 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9113218 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9113219 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9113220 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9113221 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9113222 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9113223 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano

9113249 anak yang tidak diberikan pendidikan sejak kecil maksudnya pendidikan secara umum bukan hanya agama akan cenderung melakukan perbuatan yang tidak baik yang salah satunya adalah tidak percaya adanya tuhan
9113250 mahasiswa yang cerdas cenderung tidak menerima keyakinan ortodoks dan cenderung tidak menunjukkan perilaku yang pro agama
9113251 pikiran yang lebih bersih yang menolak teori agama pada alam karena tidak cukup agama dipandang sebagai penjelasan alam digantikan olehsains
9113252 kedewasaan intelektual yang lebih besar dapat diduga menaikkan skeptisme pada masalah agama
9113253 mereka mencari cara mengkompensasi kekurangan mereka dalam kendali fisik dengan menganggap adanya kekuatan metafisik yang mengendalikan dunia penyembahan terlihat sebagai cara untuk mempengaruhi nasib seseorang dan lebih mudah menerima ketidakmampuan seseorang bila ia tahu hasilnya ada di tangan mahluk yang maha kuasa yang pemurah yang dapat dimenangkan hatinya lewat aturan ibadah yang ketat dan dapat diduga satu alasan untuk menurunnya keyakinan agama tradisional dalam masyarakat industri adalah bahwa suatu kendali teknologis pada alam mengurangi kebutuhan untuk bertopang pada kekuatan supernatural

9113315 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
9113316 you felt it all the way up until gradys at bat there that somebody was going to do something
9113317 thats the way things have been going for us but the mariners did a good job against us
9113318 hernandez had a good sinker a tight curveball and a good changeup
9113319 fortunately today i did a better job getting out of trouble than last time
9113320 in the last start i let the game speed up on me tonight was a different story
9113321 i never would have thought we were not going to score any more runs
9113322 that was the difference in the ballgame we werent able to finish innings off
9113323 we were kind of due to come up with a couple tough breaks
9113324 traveling to the country of georgia to assess civilian casualties
9113325 crimes on a day to day basis with the full awareness of officers at all levels of command
9113326 wont even follow bin laden to the cave where he lives
9113327 my son had water to his ceiling and i had water on the 2nd floor of my house about 2 feet there were 9 of us and we ended up with 30 we rescued people out of their homes
9113328 i dont wish it on anybody but i hope it stays away from here
9113329 freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction we didnt pass it to our children in the bloodstream it must be fought for protected and handed on for them to do the same or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our childrens children what it was once like in the united states where men were free
9113330 children should be educated and instructed in the principles of freedom
9113331 that the said constitution be never construed to authorize congress to infringe the just liberty of the press or the rights of conscience or to prevent the people of the united states from keeping their own arms
9113332 before a standing army can rule the people must be disarmed as they are in almost every kingdom in europe the supreme power in america cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a superior force to any band of regular troops that can be on any pretense raised in the united states
9113333 our first story tonight is from andrea mitchell who has learned that sen
9113334 also ahead nbc news correspondent lee cowan is traveling with sen obama and reports that he is a really big tipper and his teeth are perfect
9113335 durante esse per odo o auditor da sefaz simulou uma avalia o preliminar na loja da v tima e disse que o comerciante devia entre r 20 mil e r 25 mil de impostos ao estado os dois entraram em acordo por r 4 mil ontem seria pago a primeira parcela os outros tr s mil seriam pagos posteriormente
9113336 isso teria sido o estompim para que o comerciante decidisse levar o caso ao conhecimento da corregedoria
9113337 o cear tem recebido muitos investimentos o que garante a manuten o da popula o local algumas ind strias mesmo que de pequena dimens o impulsionam a economia local e levam as pessoas a pensar que melhor ficar
9113338 horizonte foi uma das cidades que mais se industrializaram nos ltimos anos
9113339 neste caso como o programa est voltado para a atividade rural as pessoas ficam concentradas no campo ao inv s de se deslocarem para as sedes de suas cidades
9113340 o bra o repressivo tem que desaparecer por isso o pronasci voltado para as prefeituras que ter o nos guardas municipais um preparo adequado para a prote o
9113341 muito importante fazer contato direto com esses agentes que fazem a seguran a na cidade o programa s funciona quando isso acontece como aqui em fortaleza
9113342 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9113343 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9113344 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9113345 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9113346 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9113347 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9113348 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9113349 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9113350 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9113351 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9113352 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9113353 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9113354 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9113355 no primeiro dia tivemos representantes de 73 institui es e no ltimo dia ontem j eram 83 institui es
9113356 a partir desse documento vamos obter subs dios para pol ticas p blicas destinadas melhoria dos recursos h dricos
9113357 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9113358 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9113359 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9113360 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9113361 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9113362 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9113363 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9113364 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9113365 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9113366 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9113367 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9113368 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9113369 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9113370 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9113371 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9113372 foi de repente em menos de quatro minutos estava tudo escuro e coberto pela fuma a muita gente se abalou porque n o conseguia respirar e nem abrir os olhos houve at desmaio
9113373 eles estavam muito nervosos s dois que apresentavam quadro de epilepsia tiveram de permanecer por mais algumas horas no hospital
9113374 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9113375 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9113376 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9113377 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9113378 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9113379 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9113380 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9113381 demos mais autonomia ao nordeste o que permite mais agilidade para tomadas de decis o
9113382 o plano de investimentos de 2009 ser aprovado em reuni o em setembro mas ser bastante mais agressivo no processo de expans o em 2008 fizemos uma redefini o de estrat gia e de formatos mais do que expans o
9113383 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9113384 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9113385 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9113386 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9113387 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9113388 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9113389 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9113390 who are open to doing something on the production side
9113391 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9113392 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9113393 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9113394 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9113395 ainda n o resolveu dizem que pelo menos uma vez por semana roubam um carro aqui

9113417 we were initially planning an exchange with entrains this year
9113418 but with airfare prices and the value of the euro rising sharply and with no warning we decided to wait one year and give an opportunity to interested parties to participate in the exchange
9113419 its a great way to learn how people in other countries live as we stay with local families when we visit
9113420 its basically my favorite place in the world this region

9113425 when i was a child my best friends grandfather had a place in inlet on sixth lake
9113426 i came up with him a couple times and it just lived with me forever it didnt take much just those two visits with my friend
9113427 ever since i got my first car at age 19 id come up here
9113428 it would be kind of funny if i named my boy big moose or placid or marcy i guess if it was a girl it would be ok to call her marcy
9113429 ive been back a few times as a player and i know what to expect
9113430 but im a big boy and i can handle it the only concern i have is that my players dont get affected
9113431 as far as im concerned they can hate me all they like but all im interested in is getting three points
9113432 it might be a competition between the two of us as to who gets more abuse
9113433 will curbs be glad im there i wasnt going to say it but i was thinking that
9113434 if you do well at west ham theyre the best fans in the world
9113435 lee has just joined a new team and has to adapt and i also considered the fact that seol is once again playing for his club team
9113436 i have selected players who are fit and in form in the k league and have striven to maintain balance in the team
9113437 as it is there is no easy way out any of the 10 teams can qualify for the finals
9113438 this is the ambition of all 10 countries when they go into the final round of the qualifiers
9113439 we began our preparation with a month long camp in europe which i believe has gone well and now we want to put the players into a final test with the friendly against bahrain
9113440 they are a good team and they come with the same objective that we have its about having a good final look the result is of little consequence but a win will help keep morale high
9113441 the players want to play and put their skills to practise

9113466 on the other hand theres no particular need to rush it
9113467 you may agree or disagree with giving the base to uga but the nice thing was we got to talk about it
9113468 there is something about a national convention that makes it as fascinating as a revival or a hanging
9113469 one sits through all the long sessions wishing all the delegates and alternates were dead and in hell and then suddenly there comes a show so gaudy and hilarious so melodramatic and obscene so unimaginably exhilarating and preposterous that one lives a gorgeous year in an hour
9113470 it was a great speech it was an innovative experience to see a black man speaking at the democratic convention
9113471 corporate power has virtually made elections and elected officials obsolete and irrelevant
9113472 has an excellent coat and bears a striking resemblance to his father
9113473 hes a great pet already answers to his name loves to travel and ride in the car
9113474 uga vii already loves to sit on the dock by the river and is ready for his first boat ride
9113475 ga 15 is not the road less traveled it is the road well traveled
9113476 the road he takes this weekend his father grandfather great grandfather and great great grandfather and so on took before him but this little dog has not traveled that way before he does not know what awaits him
9113477 he took to it like a duck takes to water
9113478 you could almost sense that he was in his element and he was ready to go
9113479 when everyone took a break he dunked into my parents fountain with his jersey on
9113480 hell lift up his paws so you keep petting him
9113481 how do you introduce a dog to 90 000 screaming fans
9113482 this is when we hope instinct is going to kick in
9113483 mccain declared as the pair stood together for the first time at a boisterous rally in ohio just days before the opening of the partys national convention
9113484 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9113485 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9113486 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9113487 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9113488 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9113489 if people give you a shelter you should take it
9113490 gustav could become a major hurricane near the time it crosses western cuba

9113492 my interest has grown a little faster than i expected
9113493 weve accomplished a lot and im glad to be part of it
9113494 the city wants to change and youve got to let it change but thats where the ordinances come in
9113495 its a historic town so you dont want to see it just paved over
9113496 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9113497 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9113498 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9113499 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9113500 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9113501 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

9113508 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations

9113513 it was very significant that sen obama directly addressed the gun violence issue in our country
9113514 i was fortunate to be in mile high stadium last night to watch and listen to sen obamas historic speech as he accepted the democratic nomination for president of the united states
9113515 it was very significant that sen obama directly addressed the gun violence issue in our country he decided to strike a balance between rights and responsibilities and showed how we can have common sense gun laws in america to protect our families and communities
9113516 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than they are for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping out of the hands of criminals
9113517 since the supreme court issued its opinion on the meaning of the second amendment the debate over gun laws in america has moved to the middle ground now common sense gun laws that save lives and protect police can be debated on their merits
9113518 america wants sensible restrictions on the easy access to dangerous weapons and sen obama clearly recognized that last night
9113519 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9113520 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9113521 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9113522 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9113523 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9113524 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9113525 no one works for someone we all just work together
9113526 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9113527 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9113528 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9113529 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9113530 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9113531 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9113532 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9113533 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9113534 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9113535 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9113536 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9113537 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9113538 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9113539 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9113540 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9113541 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9113542 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9113543 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9113544 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9113545 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9113546 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9113547 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9113548 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9113549 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9113550 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9113551 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9113552 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9113553 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9113554 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9113555 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9113556 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9113557 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9113558 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9113559 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9113560 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9113561 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9113562 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9113563 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9113564 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9113565 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9113566 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9113567 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9113568 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9113569 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9113570 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9113571 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9113572 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9113573 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9113574 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9113575 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9113576 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9113577 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9113578 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9113579 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9113580 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9113581 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9113582 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9113583 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9113584 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9113585 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9113586 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9113587 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9113588 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9113589 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9113590 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9113591 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9113592 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
9113593 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
9113594 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9113595 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9113596 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9113597 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9113598 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9113599 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9113600 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9113601 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9113602 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9113603 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9113604 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9113605 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9113606 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9113607 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9113608 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9113609 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

9113612 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9113613 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

9113616 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9113617 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9113618 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9113619 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9113620 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9113621 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9113622 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9113623 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9113624 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9113625 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9113626 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9113627 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9113628 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9113629 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9113630 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9113631 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9113632 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9113633 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9113634 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9113635 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9113636 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9113637 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9113638 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9113639 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9113640 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9113641 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9113642 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9113643 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9113644 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9113645 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9113646 inequities in health avoidable health inequities arise because of the circumstances in which people grow live work and age and the systems put in place to deal with illness
9113647 the conditions in which people live and die are in turn shaped by political social and economic forces
9113648 to marshal the evidence on what can be done to promote health equity and to foster a global movement to achieve it
9113649 reducing health inequities is for the commission on social determinants of health an ethical imperative social injustice is killing people on a grand scale
9113650 think of it as a dinner party thrown by revolutionaries
9113651 good food is not just for the middle class we want to make it accessible
9113652 when you take the time to do things right you are rewarded
9113653 the more you learn the more you realize you dont want to eat a lot of whats being shipped into supermarkets
9113654 i dont want to serve something to my guests that i wont eat myself
9113655 we dont take time to eat and celebrate food were on the run putting things in our body that dont make sense
9113656 this is a very grass roots effort that connects young artists environmentalists and young people all of whom are engaged for their own reason
9113657 we have to meet each other and understand our power as a group
9113658 there would be only two people of working age for every person aged 65 or more in 2060 compared with four persons to one today
9113659 the keyboard is mightier than the sword even a blogger can no longer tolerate the quality of governance that the country is having now
9113660 a lot of people have come alive in the last 10 years theyre the reformasi generation and they think about politics in fundamentally different ways

9113670 well make sure we continue our activities in afghanistan its what ito would have wanted
9113671 as the person in charge i felt truly sorry for his parents
9113672 its something that kazuya asked a local musician to make for him
9113673 he received it because his activities and work were appreciated
9113674 well temporarily pull japanese staff out but continue our work with local staff as ito would have wanted
9113675 as a parent id like someone to take over his activities but safety is the first priority this continuation of activities should only happen once its been properly established that the area is safe
9113676 a team of doctors at lilavati hospital conducted several tests and said his holiness was suffering from fatigue

9113683 i express spiritual closeness and solidarity to the brothers and sisters in faith who are being so harshly tested
9113684 we do take very seriously any action that does not support our culture of diversity and inclusion

9113689 i know youve been working your way up in your chosen career for a long time but im going to now transfer you to a department you have no interest in and no experience in either
9113690 he would eat a fing lead bullet i will shoot him
9113691 maybe it was because he wouldnt fire the trooper who is divorcing palins sister
9113692 leaving the baby in the bushes like that if the baby hadnt been found it probably wouldnt have survived for long
9113693 es una posibilidad que la vengo esperando y tratar de hacer todo lo posible para no desaprovecharla y as poder salir de esta situaci n que no es la que esper bamos estoy bien con expectativas de hacer un buen partido estamos trabajando para cambiar la imagen
9113694 me siento bien en cualquier puesto porque jugu mucho tiempo de tres de cuatro o de central tanto con l nea de tres o de cuatro as que no tengo ning n tipo de problemas sensini no habla mucho a la hora de presionar de meter presi n adelante para no recuperar tan atr s la pelota y cuando tenemos la pelota pasar al ataque para defender me pidi estar cerrados y atento pero despu s me da libertad la idea es que tanto marcos como yo nos sumemos a los volantes a la hora de presionar y no dejar jugar al rival a la hora de tener la pelota mostrarnos todos para tener volumen de juego y tratar de armar buenas jugadas
9113695 fueron seis meses de terror no me hab a pasado nunca de estar tanto tiempo parado pero eso ya es pasado y trato de mejorar d a a d a para ganarme un lugar

9113699 just as each of us has one body with many members and these members do not all have the same function so in christ we who are many form one body and each member belongs to all the others
9113700 be imitators of god therefore as dearly loved children and live a life of love just as christ loved us
9113701 my life was kind of like a little bit of an emotional rollercoaster i knew there was something missing and always wanted to do my best but i was struggling with it
9113702 at the back of my mind god was always there kind of pushing me and saying why are you doing this
9113703 i had to kind of break away from being a follower to just being my own self and being a leader and finding my way
9113704 i definitely felt different about my life immediately my emotions and just a calming sense just a sense of peace just knowing he was with me at all times and being able to go out and glorify him was probably my greatest joy
9113705 i have to realize im not playing for me im playing for gods glory and im playing so that all the little kids and fans watching can see his light through me

9113740 probably came from all my years making fun of people that had it that was my karma coming back
9113741 all i know is i have doubles at 2 30 tomorrow thats about as far as im thinking
9113742 i think its tough to make any kind of decision in a rash moment and there was no decision made before the tournament so you know i dont think its time to make a certain statement now
9113743 it was some of my least great tennis out there
9113744 and i still was trying to stay positive and try to you know turn it around that was probably the one positive ill take out of this match
9113745 as long as im doing the splits that means im healthy
9113746 when im not doing the splits you know theres something wrong
9113747 im not too sure about my body if i go into a split who knows if ill come back up
9113748 i wish i didnt have any drama in my matches i wish i would win nice and in a simple way
9113749 who likes drama do you know anybody that likes to get involved into tight matches

9113759 you felt this was meaty hmmm i must have been watching a different station
9113760 sarah palin is the whole package there couldnt be a better vice presidential pick
9113761 women voters are electrified and sarah is someone who is truly in sync with the way real american women think she is a reform minded woman who will give all americans born and unborn the authentic leadership they deserve
9113762 the majority of american women support commonsense restrictions on abortion adding palin to the gop ticket will resonate with independent women voters nationwide by choosing the boldly pro life sarah palin as his running mate john mccain has taken his stand as the one true authentic pro life ticket
9113763 we knew through early testing he would face special challenges and we feel privileged that god would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives we have faith that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential to make this world a better place we are truly blessed

9113771 he further admitted to covering the victims body with a sheet of plywood disposing of his bloodstained sweat shirt and washing the victims blood from his vehicle
9113772 thats when it was discovered that the jane doe was really lillian
9113773 he said he had this case from way back in the 80s and it wasnt solved
9113774 we took the file we started re interviewing people and talking to other people and reading all the reports
9113775 he went to a shop she worked at and told the owner of the business to tell her that when he found her he was going to kick her ass

9113781 ons zoontje is vernoemd naar willem die ik beschouwde als mijn broer hij kwam zeven jaar geleden om het leven door een vuurwerkongeluk het was het oudejaar dat alles ook misging in volendam
9113782 ik ben opgevoed door mijn opa en mijn oma en willem was eigenlijk hun zoon met mijn grootouders deelde ik de liefde voor de paardensport zij brachten me naar iedere wedstrijd mijn moeder was druk met mijn zussen en haar baan vandaar
9113783 het was een heel gezellige avond met veel familie bij elkaar na twaalven stak willem een groot stuk vuurwerk aan dat vroegtijdig ontplofte ik stond vlak bij hem het vuurwerk raakte zijn hoofd we hebben meteen 112 gebeld maar alle ambulances waren in volendam vanwege de nieuwjaarsbrand willem werd uiteindelijk opgehaald en doorgestuurd naar het academisch medisch centrum zo slecht was zijn toestand
9113784 hij is nog geopereerd maar de klap in zijn hoofd was te hard geweest en er waren te veel zwellingen ontstaan op 4 januari is hij overleden hij was begin 30
9113785 ik word elke dag wel een paar keer gevraagd om een feestje bij te wonen mijn werk vreet maar geeft ook veel energie ik kan echt een adrenalinerush krijgen als ik ergens van de b hne afloop dan wil ik dansen en springen tot diep in de nacht
9113786 ik heb 90 procent van de inrichting gedaan dat vindt jan een vrouwending alleen de hertenkop boven de open haard is zijn keus
9113787 hij vindt robin hood heel leuk en daar heb ik dus rekening mee gehouden het hele huis waar we gaan wonen is een beetje avontuurlijk gezellig
9113788 we hebben een zebra badkamer en een zwarte badkamer voor de gasten zelf badderen we tussen ronde romeinse bogen en we hebben kroonluchters die moeten er als we verhuizen het laatst in na de grote loungebanken die we hebben uitgezocht anders gaan de luchters kapot
9113789 jan zit aan de koffie en speelt met zijn mobiel hij laat mij mijn gang gaan en dat is ook zo lief aan hem al toen we een half jaar samen waren zat ik met de bouwtekeningen of ik maar even wilde aangeven waar de stopcontacten moesten komen
9113790 jan en ik zijn dankbaar dat het ons wordt gegund we zien elkaar misschien minder dan een normaal verliefd stel maar door al dat werken wordt het wel intenser en we helpen elkaar jan heeft me elk woord van zijn nieuwe album voorgelegd en toen ik live uitzendingen had voor de tros show twinzz is hij steeds meegegaan hij maakte me aan het lachen als ik zenuwachtig was
9113791 maar het moet ook wel eens gezegd worden dat vijfennegentig procent van de baasjes w l goed voor hun viervoeter zorgt
9113792 we hebben de overheid eindelijk zo ver dat het chippen van honden in 2011 verplicht wordt
9113793 voor katten is dit helaas nog niet het geval nog geen kwart van alle katten in nederland heeft een chip terwijl juist ook de zwerfkatten een groot probleem vormen
9113794 wie zo ruim tevoren bij een asiel aanklopt loopt dan ook minder kans dat deze tijdelijke opvang al is volgeboekt
9113795 eerst was ie een beetje boos en wagenziek maar toen we eenmaal op onze vakantiebestemming waren aangekomen was dat snel voorbij
9113796 misschien kan het chippen als het massaal wordt ingevoerd ook wel wat goedkoper
9113797 wat moet er in hemelsnaam van die kinderen terecht komen aanpakken die misbaksels
9113798 kinderen moet al op de basisschool respect voor dieren worden bijgebracht dat is de enige manier
9113799 net als in amerika v l zwaarder straffen verwaarlozing en mishandeling van dieren moeten gewoon veel harder worden aangepakt
9113800 voor alles wat je doet voor je hond krijg je het tienvoudige aan genegenheid terug
9113801 chippen moet en ook moet er betere voorlichting komen op de scholen bovendien is het hoog tijd voor een echte dierenpolitie en een beter boetebeleid want er gaat natuurlijk geen enkele preventieve werking van uit dat iemand 50 euro boete krijgt voor een misdraging die hem 5000 euro financieel voordeel oplevert
9113802 waarom verstrekken maatschappijen de passagiers niet wat meer informatie om ze gerust te stellen
9113803 vaak zitten passagiers uren in een vliegtuig en krijgen nauwelijks te horen wat er aan de hand is
9113804 waarbij natuurlijk de valkuil is dat sommige zaken voor vliegers normaal zijn maar voor niet vaak vliegende passagiers niet dus daar moet je als gezagvoerder rekening mee houden
9113805 alleen heb je bij sommige zaken een afgebroken landing bijvoorbeeld eerst alle aandacht nodig voor het vliegen de purser is trouwens ook getraind om in dat geval vast een korte melding te doen maar zodra er tijd is moet er zeker een toelichting uit de cockpit komen
9113806 bij charters is veel informatie vaak welkom op gewone lijnvluchten meestal niet de geroutineerde reiziger installeert zich en kijkt film leest werkt of slaapt allemaal zaken waarbij ik zelf routineverhalen hoe goed bedoeld ook vaak storend vind
9113807 extra aandacht bij storingen op de grond dus ook aanwezigheid in de cabine is zeker goed al blijft het primaire proces de veilige vlucht dan wel de voorbereiding voorrang hebben
9113808 welke objectieve organsiatie inspecteert vliegtuigen en maatschappijen op hun prestatie
9113809 er zou een internetsite moeten komen waarin de vliegtuigen van alle maatschappijen die bijvoorbeeld in de eu opstijgen en landen staan geregistreerd met onder andere vliegtuigtype bouwjaar gemiddelde leeftijd van de vloot en de datum van het laatste onderhoud
9113810 blijft dit type vliegtuig nu aan de grond om goed na te kijken
9113811 is er een bepaalde plaats in het vliegtuig die meer overlevingskansen biedt bij een ongeluk dan andere
9113812 youre romo like in your efficiency and big play capability

9113817 i come to this site everyday and at least 15 times a day i really do love your work and completely appreciate all the time you put in this web site
9113818 me siento encantada con que se hable de la posibilidad de participar en la pel cula
9113819 i know allot of u will find it hard to believe but my name is keith pace and i am a direct decendent of frank and pierce asbil and i really didnt know that much about them but now i know a little more thanx to this site its crazy to think im a decendant of some crazy indian killing bad asss pretty cool but i dont think i should ever go to covelo sounds like the indians there are still a little pessed lol
9113820 behalve de hond hebben we uit het asiel twee jonge poesjes ik word helemaal rustig van dit huis en ik heb er een werkkamer waar ik op mijn gemak kan nadenken
9113821 ik zit boordevol programma idee n verder kan ik er weinig over zeggen
9113822 they assumed i was an athlete because i was taller
9113823 everywhere i went people handed me their babies to take a picture with even in the airport when i was leaving people were still getting pictures with me
9113824 our main job is to go with the production management team which does all the logistics and preparation for the games thats why you arrive so early a month in advance usually setting up everything from the office space to building a set to running cables to learning everything possible about the olympics the venues the city
9113825 basically were the information resource so when the producers sit not only do they sit in actual workspace but theres a seamless transition from their new york desk to their beijing or torino desk but they also can come to our group and say we need to know where this is or we want to know how to pick up an athlete from here do you know where we can interview someone about whatever food segment they may be doing
9113826 we get there and we do all the preparation help out and we also build the transportation system whats the best way to get from here to here we have to time everything out figure out traffic patterns
9113827 were helping in all aspects of the show from running scripts to picking up guests to helping with audio microphones being guest escorts welcoming people working the green room making sure this person is in makeup at this time everything is so regimented if one person messes up it spirals out of control and its a live show and those three hours are packed solid
9113828 in beijing we went on from 7 p m to 10 p m
9113829 there are days where wed pick up the garbage to days where i was meeting the first lady so its just total extremes
9113830 youre in the middle of the olympics and when you step back and think about it the whole world was watching and youre in the epicenter its such an adrenaline rush
9113831 when the producers get there they can come straight to us and we can answer all their questions so they can immediately start setting up their interviews we know the background of the athletes the venues the whole process
9113832 each was a completely different experience in terms of the work the setup is the same but the winter games are a lot smaller so there were only 12 of us runners in torino compared to 27 in beijing
9113833 it didnt look ready when i got there but within that month the transformation occurred there were still dirt roads around the birds nest but they worked around the clock flowers went up everywhere even the taxi drivers were all wearing shirts and ties im glad i got to see beijing beforehand and then the olympic version
9113834 we were allowed in parts that have never been seen by the public before so it was really cool to see that aspect of it
9113835 the olympics is a huge operation and until you experience it you dont realize the amount of work and all those other people you dont even think about putting in hours and hours of effort
9113836 id been wanting to do something like this for a long time i asked district superintendent fred burns and he said to go ahead and do it
9113837 inmates from the jefferson county jail pressure washed the entire stadium while inmates from the eastern ohio correction center also helped were thankful to jefferson county sheriff fred abdalla for that help
9113838 the district summer maintenance staff along with the volunteers painted
9113839 they were coordinated by terry trazaskoma our maintenance supervisor and mark blasko assistant supervisor
9113840 the volunteers just did their own job along with the kids i totally appreciate it they did a nice neat job
9113841 interested participants can come in and compete in any or all three competitions sign up for the event is now under way and continue through thursday
9113842 this is a national skills competition for the boys and girls to compete separately against their peers the entrants will compete in different age groups against each other in punting a football passing a football and place kicking in a fun and engaging forum
9113843 more than four million boys and girls across the country participate every year
9113844 i met with the city to remind them of that promise
9113845 we want the wives and mothers of the community to shop where they feel safe and comfortable
9113846 when the bank dropped the ball since then banks have dropped all their balls and are refusing to loan money to start up restaurants if theyre not part of a franchise
9113847 the seminar is an eight hour course specifically designed for contractors and their employees who do property rehabilitation and property maintenance and those local landlords who perform their own maintenance
9113848 those completing the course will be certified to perform work in lead paint based situations for our office as well as state and federal agencies who require the certification
9113849 we have a number of houses in the city built before 1978 where lead based paint can be an issue
9113850 and this course will also help protect those contractors or landlords who do the work because it will officially certify them for working around that paint the training will teach these workers how to handle lead based paint and to avoid problems
9113851 the maximum number of participants is limited to 30 people so we are offering this course on a first come first served basis interested people should contact the urban projects office at 740 283 6000 extension 1700
9113852 we have been told that all contractors and property maintenance workers will be required to be certified in safe lead based renovation work by 2010 this is an opportunity to be ahead of the requirements but seating is limited and i urge interested people to contact us as soon as possible
9113853 the city will provide a free buffet style lunch for the participants
9113854 this is an excellent opportunity for contractors and landlords who do their own maintenance to learn the proper methods of working with lead based paint lead safe renovation and remodeling
9113855 and it will build up our core of contractors who are certified to do this type of work
9113856 participants will learn about the history of lead based paint and lead poisoning the health effects of lead poisoning and lead based paint laws and regulations we will also have instruction on identifying and controlling lead based paint cleaning up lead in a safe manner and lead safe waste management
9113857 all children from 12 months old to age 6 in the ohio check program to be tested
9113858 we can provide educational information for families with lead affected children
9113859 working with lead based paint can cause problems for young children a safe environment is beneficial for everyone
9113860 video at its best is better than writing at its best
9113861 im very confident that there will be an absolute clearance for mr peters in a relatively short period of time
9113862 obviously they have to check the information we have given them we gave them copies of entries on the trust statement and they will check them out with the banks
9113863 i believe that eventually justice will triumph and that in this case there will be an absolute clearance and there will hopefully be apologies from all those who have been severely prejudicial and havent look at the facts
9113864 i cant explain just how happy i am to be helping conquest racing this weekend and to get my first start in the indycar series
9113865 this will be a great opportunity for me to show what i can do im aware that it will not be easy for me coming in at the last minute and learning a new car in a new racing series but im definitely motivated to do my best and help conquest this weekend
9113866 obviously it will be a big challenge for him as he will not get that much time in the car before the race
9113867 but alex has a lot of experience especially on street courses and hes raced here in the past as well i think he will be able to adapt quickly to his new racing environment and it will be interesting to see how he does this weekend
9113868 i couldnt give my all today because of my left hand
9113869 i was turning into the pits with just one hand on the steering wheel and was unable to do my best
9113870 the track is bumpy and it was really hard on my hand i hate having to miss a race but i prefer leaving the car to alex tagliani this weekend while i rest up my hand in order for it to get better
9113871 we are continuing to execute and improve upon our business model and we believe that the company will continue to aggressively grow its revenue and efficiencies in 2008

9113875 he removed the tops some of them are removed from the bottom as you can see some of them go a foot and a half two feet into the ground
9113876 i dont know what he was doing i know he was in trouble before that the extent i dont know
9113877 they used to just fail the meters now theyre taking them completely
9113878 free parking spaces and what would you say to the guy stealing them good job
9113879 hes a fine young man and a great basketball player
9113880 reach his goal of being academically eligible to play in college as a freshman
9113881 into seeing what school will most benefit avery in addressing his academic concerns
9113882 there are violations that both nicole and madeleine are worried about
9113883 they are matters that i dont believe would rise to the level they would prosecute under the current standards of the u s attorneys office but in this circumstance perhaps theyll ignore their own standards to prosecute madeleine or her daughter to get what they want
9113884 as a result of these developments our legal team and i no longer believe we can be successful with this litigation
9113885 we are pleased to now be able to move on we look forward to an exciting future of nba basketball in oklahoma city
9113886 we have received feedback that a continuing adversarial relationship with the nba was not politically useful to the citys ongoing efforts to secure a future franchise
9113887 thus the prevailing wisdom of many in the seattle community and the advice of key members of the bcos is that seattles best chance for a professional basketball franchise is to end this litigation and allow the city state legislature and other parties to begin the necessary fence mending with the nba
9113888 it was very disappointing not being able to move forward with an effective strategy
9113889 at some point in life you have to look and see if you can achieve your goals it was not a good plan
9113890 thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
9113891 if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
9113892 hes a fine young man and a great basketball player
9113893 reach his goal of being academically eligible to play in college as a freshman
9113894 into seeing what school will most benefit avery in addressing his academic concerns
9113895 i dont realize yet that i beat the no 1 player in the world i dont realize yet that i played on the big court i dont know how im going to sleep tonight
9113896 at one point i was thinking to maybe stop at the end of this year so i guess maybe now im going to think about keeping on playing
9113897 kita kan udah ga muda lagi jadi mulai sekarang aku panggil kamu kakek kamu panggil aku nenek
9113898 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington but when you get to know her youre going to be as impressed as i am
9113899 hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9113900 governor palin not only stands with john mccain in his belief that global warming is a critical issue that must be addressed but she has been a leader in addressing climate change
9113901 he also wished her good luck but not too much luck
9113902 on his 72nd birthday this is the guys judgment of who he wants one heartbeat from the presidency
9113903 shes going to learn national security at the foot of the master for the next four years and most doctors think that hell be around at least that long
9113904 it is almost impossible to exaggerate how important that is to the conservative faith community
9113905 were in a global war were in a global economy so its less than honest if someone says that this woman is qualified to lead america right now
9113906 i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the v p does every day
9113907 im used to being very productive and working real hard
9113908 im very hands on this is a business i own not just something i am putting my name on and im a bit of a control freak
9113909 for a 200 investment weve made we got featured in the local newspaper once twice on tv and its the buzz around town i cant get a quarter page ad for 200
9113910 i personally would encourage them that having people from their church build relationships with their friends who do not attend church and invite them as their friend would be a much better strategy
9113911 they are appealing to the natural corruptions in unbelieving people the bible warns very explicitly about the dangers of greed the love of money being the root of all evil
9113912 appealing to the selfish motives of people is not christianity
9113913 we canceled services that day and said our service to the community will be our service
9113914 this wasnt a gimmick hey come to our church there was no bait and switch we didnt try to convert people we just wanted to show we care
9113915 there are a lot of worse things that people can be doing in life than getting people to come to church
9113916 are they being tempted to think the church is about such gimmicks and external rewards
9113917 the amount of time ive spent being interviewed about all the good things were doing and only hearing about the gas thing on the news is a little disappointing
9113918 no if anyone orders merlot im leaving i am not drinking any fucking merlot
9113919 the launch was meant to be in london but i said no
9113920 all you want but im not brand conscious as long as i like it i will go for it who does not want to save anyway
9113921 they told me that they werent sure he would live through the weekend
9113922 i was just scrolling through these pictures and i saw the photo of tsegenet and i said oh my god thats my daughter
9113923 i fell in love with tsegenet and it just happens shes hiv positive
9113924 i feel like im on the cutting edge of making an impact on this epidemic
9113925 its given us a chance to be ambassadors and our children to be ambassadors
9113926 she doesnt get sick any more than my other children
9113927 well if i have roughly 14 000 i am going to spend on living space anyway is there something more creative i can do with it
9113928 i am really a glutton for light i mean i do not want to be living in a cave
9113929 i probably could have gotten away with even a smaller solar array but it can be kind of cloudy in new haven sometimes and i thought that was something that i did not want to compromise on so it will be a very well lit space
9113930 the tiny house has taken me by the hand and led me through the process of building it
9113931 you know when you are doing something and the process takes over your arms are moving because the project has almost gotten inside your body and told you what to do
9113932 i thought im working with a building company and i have some skills
9113933 im not sure everyone will live in a tiny house but a lot of people will live in a small house so the kinds of things she will learn will be useful to engineers and architects and homeowners there is no reason why so called second homes on a lake cant be something more like this than a mansion
9113934 were ecstatic that one of our students is pushing the envelope here
9113935 not all theologians benefit from their scholarship there is a divorce between what they do as scholars and how they live as mere mortals

9113937 ive had students tell me the course was a life changing experience
9113938 in our evangelical world we take the authority of the bible seriously traditionally women have been excluded from ordination and things of that sort david really took the text seriously and led people through it to show them you can support gods call to women in all calls to leadership including ordination that was a major contribution

9113952 while catholic teaching is clear that life begins at conception many catholics do not ascribe to that view

9114002 se hace una protecci n a la toma de decisi n de todos los entrerrianos
9114003 es un acto de libertad a lo que se llega con conocimiento
9114004 el que no conoce no puede decidir ni sobre su propia vida ni sobre su familia y tampoco incidir sobre la sociedad
9114005 esa responsabilidad que compete al estado de amparar y bregar por la vida de sus ciudadanos
9114006 se termina con una de las peores inequidades que es la desigualdad de los conocimientos a la hora de decidir

9114008 la naturaleza jur dica de la jubilaci n del anses y la naturaleza jur dica del sistema de amas de casa son totalmente distintas
9114009 creo que el novel funcionario tiene una tremenda desinformaci n sobre el r gimen de amas de casa hace los mandados con falta de informaci n y con ignorancia supina
9114010 cuando nosotros planteamos la compensaci n necesaria que tiene que hacer la naci n por el d ficit de la caja de jubilaciones de la provincia se acord dejar de lado lo que correspond a al sistema jubilatorio de amas de casa por lo tanto el sistema sigui por otro carril y las amas de casa se anotaron en el sistema nacional
9114011 est tan mal informado alanis dijo busti al punto que desconoce que yo no present ning n proyecto de resoluci n al respecto simplemente digo o se logra un acuerdo a trav s de una negociaci n con el anses en el las beneficiarias del sistema de amas de casa y se les reconozca el aporte que hicieron durante tantos a os para obtener la jubilaci n o cada ama de casa renunciar al beneficio y defender sus derechos en la justicia
9114012 aspiramos a que ejerzan el poder de polic a porque tiene el contacto directo con los prestadores y las empresas

9114015 lamentable la actitud del gobernador de la provincia sergio urribarri de salir a apretar telef nicamente a los intendentes para que oficien de amanuenses de lo que no se anima a decir cara a cara al ex gobernador jorge busti
9114016 estoy seguro que a partir de ma ana desfilar n declaraciones period sticas de varios intendentes y funcionarios fabricadas en serie por los servicios de informaciones del estado pretendiendo esmerilar la figura de quien fuera tres veces gobernador de esta provincia tan s lo para congraciarse con quien hoy ejerce la gobernaci n
9114017 nuestro gobernador a adi zavallo en lugar de tomar asistencia a los intendentes deber a reunirse formalmente con el titular de la caja de jubilaciones a los efectos de elaborar una propuesta alternativa al atropello del anses y exigir en buenos aires una respuesta que beneficie a las amas de casa de nuestra provincia
9114018 ser obligatoria en todo el territorio de la provincia la provisi n de profilaxis postexposici n a toda persona que haya sido v ctima de delitos contra la integridad sexual y que acepte expresamente recibirla
9114019 como principal objetivo evitar el riesgo de adquirir el vih como consecuencia del il cito
9114020 el ofrecimiento de la medicaci n preventiva se har informando al mismo tiempo sobre sus beneficios contraindicaciones riesgos y alternativas a suministrarle a la v ctima para que otorgue su consentimiento informado al tratamiento
9114021 el juez de la causa deber ordenar al m dico forense como primera medida de instrucci n que informe a la v ctima en los t rminos de la ley nacional n 23 798 de lucha contra el sida y ofrezca la medicaci n antirretroviral en un plazo no mayor a dos horas de padecido el delito contra la integridad sexual
9114022 el ofrecimiento de la profilaxis indicada se har de acuerdo con la opini n fundada de m dico especialista en infectolog a
9114023 deber consentir o rechazar categ ricamente la profilaxis ofrecida luego de haberse informado de sus efectos y bajo responsabilidad del m dico forense se dejar debida constancia de la decisi n en formularios escritos
9114024 el estado provincial asegurar en cada dependencia policial un stock de profilaxis para garantizar el cumplimiento de la presente ley asimismo se dispondr de la medicaci n antirretroviral en el cuerpo m dico forense
9114025 son las personas v ctimas de delitos contra la integridad sexual quienes adem s de ser sometidas a una de las peores acciones humanas como lo es la violaci n quedan expuestas al riesgo imprevisible de contraer enfermedades de transmisi n sexual ya que hasta el estado de la ciencia actual no se encuentran alternativas seguras terap uticas preventivas que impidan o curen la infecci n por vih
9114026 tal es el caso del sida cuya prevenci n efectiva comienza sin duda por la educaci n en algunos campos de la vida humana obviamente las acciones preventivas en situaciones semejantes no tienen eficacia ante la aberrante conducta delictiva que adem s de provocar la m s terrible humillaci n como si fuera poco expone impunemente a la v ctima al peligro de contraer tan gravosa enfermedad

9114028 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
9114029 that buckncindykill said that obama was going to raise taxes on these small businessmen obama said he is going to eliminate them there i knew it buck is a liar
9114030 barack obama can fake sincerity and that more than the words of a speech or the pageantry that precedes it is the key to his power as a speaker
9114031 the secret six are morally gray and sexually perverted how could i pass that up
9114032 the biggest problem with the hold on the title is were not going to do plastic man without ethan
9114033 thats the rule now i dont see the reason to do it plastic man can do guest star appearances here and there but there is no sense doing the book without ethan hes the most passionate about it
9114034 also plastic man is a character that i hate to say it but he needs star power to draw attention to his title and with ethans support and what he brings to the table thats the way to do the book but naturally with everything going on with the flash rebirth and other projects floating around its just a matter of time of getting into it more than anything else

9114038 se contaban con los dedos de una mano los dirigentes de partido de gobierno que criticaban la privatizaci n
9114039 hoy felizmente consideran que fue un error que se desmantel el ahorro popular
9114040 nadie puede ignorar que una provincia debe tener un banco
9114041 no enga arse con la tesis de la privatizaci n
9114042 si tuvieron decisi n para hacer esta cosa por el banco de entre r os hace m s de setenta a os por qu no la vamos a hacer nosotros
9114043 hay un hecho concreto el estado no puede estimular la creaci n de un banco nosotros que no somos gobierno que estamos dando la pol tica de estado tenemos bajo todo punto de vista que consagrar este despacho
9114044 ser a un constituyente desgraciado si yo no defendiera la necesidad de la creaci n de un banco en entre r os
9114045 yo dije que si no se abr a el banco el lunes desaparec a y en 48 horas se logr esta forma de un paraguas del banco naci n para salvar la fuente de trabajo
9114046 en 1983 al 87 se cometieron graves errores en la administraci n del banco porque se concentr su cartera en diez empresas y fue absolutamente incobrable y signific que en 1987 cuando entr al gobierno entraba un veedor del banco central designado por machinea por el mal funcionamiento
9114047 despu s nos manejamos con el banco de entre r os en manos del estado y luego con el gobierno de mario moine por sus fuertes compromisos perd a mucha plata y en vez de ser una fuente de cr dito para productores el gobierno deb a invertir para mantenerlo
9114048 lo de moine fue una necesidad porque no s lo se ca a el banco sino que se ca a la provincia

9114051 la cla sula es correcta hacia el futuro pero requiere de equilibrio fiscal politicas publicas que controlen las cuentas no requiere de emisi n de bonos pide econom as sanas y equilibradas si se hace eso y se lo prolonga en el tiempo el tiempo dar la posibilidad de que el estado recupere esta herramienta y tenga un banco mixto o enteramente estatal es bueno poner la cl usula porque es bueno pensar en el futuro
9114052 siempre fuimos pilotos de tormenta nunca nos fuimos siempre nos quedamos dios quiera que con el correr de los a os y con pol ticas p blicas y sin proyectos fara nicos este estado provincial recupere el equilibrio para tener una herramienta fundamental como el banco de entre rios

9114068 the mccain campaign is reveling in the fact that palin is a game changer
9114069 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team

9114077 i cant resist that if you tell me you are looking for a long lost relative i will be obsessed with how to find them

9114083 i think its an interesting contrast between the two campaigns they both have their strengths and seem to have picked a running mate that goes opposite that strength
9114084 i think he promised the store he promised he had more programs and more ideas i dont know how anybody is going to pay for all this stuff
9114085 i would say shes just as experienced as barack obama shes a governor hes a senator i think shes got more leadership experience than a senator would have
9114086 thats all right i mean i think john mccain more than makes up for that
9114087 it still bothers me i still miss my daughter and i still have no results of what happened to her
9114088 today comes and its like youre almost catapulted back six years ago to the actual phone call
9114089 it was done i mean you dont just pick up and take a vehicle and a human being and they just dont disappear and audrey didnt leave on her own
9114090 somebody knows something and knows what happened to her i dont expect to see her again but i would love to know what happened to her and why
9114091 im very pleased im excited because there has been a lot about the old boys and we need change and all that and this certainly indicates mccain is looking for someone who will bring change
9114092 its a feeble attempt to show the party is progressive
9114093 women are certainly smart enough to look at the issues and what she stands for
9114094 certainly this morning no one could recognize the name sarah palin by the end of next week it will be a name well recognized by everyone

9114103 after 9 11 nobody wanted to hear anything bad about america
9114104 nobody loves a war better than the president and a few years ago it got to the point where if i said anything i truly believed about the iraq war or global warming during a concert people would get up and leave thats fine with me actually its a badge of honour
9114105 little by little it became clear that bush was bizarre and dangerous
9114106 i would do concerts where i would see people in the audience sitting with their arms crossed looking angry as i said i was right 40 years ago and i am right now and throw my fist in the air now theyre listening bushs great trick is to suggest that to go against him is to be unpatriotic slowly people realised that
9114107 i represent so much before ive even opened my mouth but i was more active when i was young and its only now that im spending time with my family

9114110 the vietnamese developed all sorts of neuroses and phobias after the war ended because they were no longer spending every day in the heightened state that comes with not knowing if youre going to be killed or not when the war ended a lot of us lost direction i certainly did
9114111 i had this great fear of going commercial as a result of becoming well known at such a young age i was afraid of the wider world but i did also have deeply held beliefs that i clung on to tenaciously the big event was meeting martin luther king in 1956 at a quaker seminar that pretty much shaped the direction my life took
9114112 they laughed all the time and told racist jokes about themselves and i realised that nobody could see that side of them they had to be seen as serious and i related to that we got to a restaurant and i asked them dont you have a big march to organise they said we just have you get a public image that you have to live up to but your private reality is often very different

9114116 um yes and then when they dont want you to ride on the freeway anymore they put up a sign saying all cyclists must exit
9114117 actually 101 is a freeway through arcata and it is signed the as the coastal bike route
9114118 they have a specific definition for freeway they mean limited access it probably just looked like a freeway
9114119 well a sign said freeway begins and then there were off ramps and on ramps and overpasses
9114120 well you cant ride on the freeway here in sonoma county
9114121 you just missed the other guy he just pulled me over to tell me i cant ride on the freeway not more than 500 feet back

9114132 charlottetown has a great core of lifters and ive been lucky enough to train with guys like darren weatherbie tom nicholls and john macdonald who have experience on the world stage said macinnis
9114133 its amazing how strong our team is looking so early
9114134 our intensity is way up and our players are very fit we havent had to make a lot of changes as to where we plan on using our players
9114135 weve got some good changes we had a young team last year and weve got most of them back
9114136 im so impressed with training camp everyone is competing so hard i really think we have what it takes to compete in the atlantic university sport conference this year i feel we definitely have a shot at the championship
9114137 our games will be fast paced with players like paul craig and ben paynter up front as strikers our wide players like dan macaleer and josh vessey are both quick and fast players
9114138 well have a good battle for the starting keeper position with rob morrison and andrew macswain and dave feener in camp weve got peter connaughton and nathan snowie in midfield that will provide a lot of maturity and leadership to the team
9114139 that means we play a lot of games in september
9114140 we play every weekend in september with a couple of midweek games we ve always been pretty well prepared out of the gate and well look for a good start
9114141 it got to a point where the money was too much for what we wanted to pay
9114142 we thought we had made a considerable offer but when there was the threat of an offer sheet at such an exaggerated dollar amount it really led us to believe that making a deal was an easier way and would give us the return that we needed for this player
9114143 andrej is a perfect fit within our plan to rebuild the lightning into a contender
9114144 he has a strong all around game he competes he moves the puck and he can handle big strong forwards defensively
9114145 perhaps most importantly were pleased to add a 22 year old player with almost 250 nhl games already under his belt we know andrej will continue to grow and improve as he matures with the rest of our defence
9114146 i thought his first year in ottawa was real good i though his last two years left something to be desired
9114147 i was hoping i could convince him to take a contract thats fair and reasonable so he could really develop into the player we hoped he could be but that wasnt in the books
9114148 really quiet but a real good player he can play the point on the power play and shoots the puck really well
9114149 oh thats a 11100010 instruction that means you need to add subtract two registers
9114150 ive been a pastor for 35 years and im in favor of choice

9114157 i think its pretty clear you need two functioning quarterbacks in this league and were lucky to have that
9114158 its about winning and we all signed up for this and we know whats at stake and what the opportunity is
9114159 the fact weve already won the season series against toronto is good and the only pressure we face now is what we put on ourselves
9114160 toronto is fighting for their lives like us and we have to approach every game with a playoff mentality because for us its a playoff game
9114161 were still in a position to make the playoffs and every game is critically important because of our record

9114209 the allegations surfaced during the investigation but we had to do our due diligence
9114210 first the assumption is that women are stupid enough to vote for a woman just because she is a woman
9114211 we missed a gap on that trap play they broke for a score in the first half

9114213 we worked very hard this week in practice on our conditioning it was extremely humid out there tonight and our kids really responded to the weather i give fairless a lot of credit they fought hard and never quit we lost a lot of letter winners this past season to graduation we are a very young team so every game is a learning experience for us we put the ball on the ground a few times again tonight well continue to work on that but overall i am pleased with where we are at this point with a lot of work ahead

9114219 sony ericsson wanted to make sure our first hsdpa handset was the perfect combination of style and function as all know hsdpa is a big leap forward in the speed of mobile functionality but as always sony ericsson does not deliver technology for its own sake
9114220 we believe the z750 is such a compelling offer because not only will it be one of the best looking clamshells on the market but it also provides the tools or applications which really let you get the most from these broadband speeds
9114221 sony ericsson is continuing to deliver on the promise of the marriage of sony and ericsson with iconic products such as the z750 says najmi jarwala president sony ericsson mobile communications usa inc there is no question that hsdpa is critical for north american gsm operators and we believe products like the z750 will entice the mass market to tap into everything these faster networks enable consumers to do while on the move

9114226 bda sports will continue doing what it does best getting the best results possible for our clients when it comes to contracts endorsements marketing and other opportunities which is why bda continues to expand the number of players it represents

9114228 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9114229 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9114230 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9114231 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9114232 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9114233 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9114234 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9114235 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9114236 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9114237 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9114238 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9114239 there are no bad books any more than there are ugly women
9114240 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9114241 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9114242 getting to interact with people in a fun and crazy setting
9114243 i am not interested in football itself but i like hanging out with my friends its great to jay moseley takes time out for the community
9114244 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9114245 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9114246 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9114247 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9114248 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9114249 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9114250 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9114251 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9114252 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9114253 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9114254 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9114255 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9114256 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9114257 como no muero en este momento voy a vivir mejor hasta el ltimo momento de mi vida
9114258 gracias por todo gracias por este d a tan largo un d a de 57 a os de vida ha sido un d a bonito gracias incluso por lo doloroso lo he apreciado todo
9114259 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9114260 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9114261 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9114262 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9114263 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9114264 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9114265 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9114266 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9114267 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9114268 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9114269 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9114270 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9114271 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9114272 nasty piece of work pennys from heaven hell on wheels powerful and just plain talented
9114273 of the hard working husband and wife duo at behind the world productions inc
9114274 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9114275 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9114276 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9114277 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9114278 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9114279 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9114280 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9114281 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9114282 but in indian airports this non aeronautical revenue constitutes only 25
9114283 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9114284 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

9114287 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9114288 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9114289 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9114290 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9114291 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9114292 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9114293 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9114294 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

9114296 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9114297 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9114298 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9114299 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9114300 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9114301 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9114302 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9114303 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9114304 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9114305 and we owe usda a considerable degree of deference in its interpretation of the term
9114306 the skill set you need in terms of the coordination and balance and things like that you cannot choose to drink and ride its just the wrong choice to make

9114319 its tough to turn to obama and say youre too inexperienced when youre a 72 year old presidential candidate who has chosen a 44 year old with even less government experience to be next in line
9114320 ive spent the last few months looking for a running mate who can best help me shake up washington and make it start working again for the people that are counting on us
9114321 and its with great pride and gratitude that i tell you i have found the right partner
9114322 i predict any conservatives who have been lukewarm thus far in their support of the mccain candidacy will work their hearts out
9114323 she builds an audience for a convention that might otherwise have been ignored
9114324 now people will tune in to get to know her shes obviously fascinating shes quirky
9114325 in her first year and a half she has governed fairly pragmatically and from the middle
9114326 the question thats obviously on everyones mind is is her thin resume going to blow things up and essentially make the pick a disaster
9114327 an encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics

9114331 as a result of these developments our legal team and i no longer believe we can be successful with this litigation
9114332 we are pleased to now be able to move on we look forward to an exciting future of nba basketball in oklahoma city
9114333 we have received feedback that a continuing adversarial relationship with the nba was not politically useful to the citys ongoing efforts to secure a future franchise
9114334 thus the prevailing wisdom of many in the seattle community and the advice of key members of the bcos is that seattles best chance for a professional basketball franchise is to end this litigation and allow the city state legislature and other parties to begin the necessary fence mending with the nba
9114335 it was very disappointing not being able to move forward with an effective strategy
9114336 at some point in life you have to look and see if you can achieve your goals it was not a good plan
9114337 as a result of these developments our legal team and i no longer believe we can be successful with this litigation
9114338 we are pleased to now be able to move on we look forward to an exciting future of nba basketball in oklahoma city
9114339 we have received feedback that a continuing adversarial relationship with the nba was not politically useful to the citys ongoing efforts to secure a future franchise
9114340 thus the prevailing wisdom of many in the seattle community and the advice of key members of the bcos is that seattles best chance for a professional basketball franchise is to end this litigation and allow the city state legislature and other parties to begin the necessary fence mending with the nba
9114341 it was very disappointing not being able to move forward with an effective strategy
9114342 at some point in life you have to look and see if you can achieve your goals it was not a good plan
9114343 we are pleased mr schultz sees that it is neither in his nor seattles best interest to continue this litigation
9114344 the team has left for its new home in oklahoma city and its time to move on
9114345 its very cool to have our team running so well to be on top of our game and its really fun to have somebody like kyle thats so fast
9114346 there have been a couple of races where its like either me or him and i think that brings out the best in a lot of people
9114347 for us its been a lot of fun like i said if it comes down to just him and i for the championship that would be fine but i have a feeling some of these other guys are gonna have something to say about that
9114348 besides that they have a little better race cars than us at sometimes then no not really
9114349 yeah theyve caught up to us the past few weeks but we finished second its hard to put that into trying to become any better
9114350 theres only one guy i guess that youre trying to beat the past two races but its that one guy thats going to haunt you the rest of the year all we can do is try to do our best and come up with some better packages to end the year out strong
9114351 i even joke around with guys with myself that carl is bff carl were best friends i dont believe its a rivalry i believe that we can still be friends and stuff like that and have that relationship on the racetrack
9114352 its very cool to have our team running so well to be on top of our game and its really fun to have somebody like kyle thats so fast
9114353 there have been a couple of races where its like either me or him and i think that brings out the best in a lot of people

9114357 theres only one guy i guess that youre trying to beat the past two races but its that one guy thats going to haunt you the rest of the year all we can do is try to do our best and come up with some better packages to end the year out strong
9114358 i even joke around with guys with myself that carl is bff carl were best friends i dont believe its a rivalry i believe that we can still be friends and stuff like that and have that relationship on the racetrack
9114359 when ive won hes congratulated me and thats why all this stuff this week i kind of just got a chuckle out of it because i know deep down that what he says doesnt matter to me and what i say doesnt really matter to him what really matters is we race well on the racetrack so id say that well be fine

9114371 he is a solid defensive player and a very good athlete
9114372 permission was not sought or granted nor would it have been given
9114373 the state of ohio is an awkward situation roman is a potential witness for the state and has been of great assistance so we certainly had to take that into account
9114374 we do understand the court has to keep control in the courtroom with that in mind were asking the court not to impose a term of incarceration
9114375 i just wanted to apologize personally to you and to the courtroom
9114376 it was not my intention to disrespect you or anybody in the courtroom i dont know what else i can do im just really sorry
9114377 it has nothing to do with you and me personally its the way things must be in the county and in this country
9114378 the day that you did this i thought about the direction the court should go
9114379 and rather than placing you in jail that day which i had every right to do i took into consideration your emotional state
9114380 i have done what has been requested of me and you will now be returning to lebanon correctional institute
9114381 your criminal theft offenses have escalated to the point that i need to stop it
9114382 i need to send the message that this court is going to protect the elderly in belmont county
9114383 no others people were injured he was just trying to help someone out the hook snapped when he initially accelerated his vehicle in attempt to pull the other vehicle out of the mud
9114384 they were just enjoying some off road activities with their four wheel drives
9114385 they assumed i was an athlete because i was taller
9114386 everywhere i went people handed me their babies to take a picture with even in the airport when i was leaving people were still getting pictures with me
9114387 our main job is to go with the production management team which does all the logistics and preparation for the games thats why you arrive so early a month in advance usually setting up everything from the office space to building a set to running cables to learning everything possible about the olympics the venues the city
9114388 basically were the information resource so when the producers sit not only do they sit in actual workspace but theres a seamless transition from their new york desk to their beijing or torino desk but they also can come to our group and say we need to know where this is or we want to know how to pick up an athlete from here do you know where we can interview someone about whatever food segment they may be doing
9114389 we get there and we do all the preparation help out and we also build the transportation system whats the best way to get from here to here we have to time everything out figure out traffic patterns
9114390 were helping in all aspects of the show from running scripts to picking up guests to helping with audio microphones being guest escorts welcoming people working the green room making sure this person is in makeup at this time everything is so regimented if one person messes up it spirals out of control and its a live show and those three hours are packed solid
9114391 in beijing we went on from 7 p m to 10 p m
9114392 there are days where wed pick up the garbage to days where i was meeting the first lady so its just total extremes
9114393 youre in the middle of the olympics and when you step back and think about it the whole world was watching and youre in the epicenter its such an adrenaline rush
9114394 when the producers get there they can come straight to us and we can answer all their questions so they can immediately start setting up their interviews we know the background of the athletes the venues the whole process
9114395 each was a completely different experience in terms of the work the setup is the same but the winter games are a lot smaller so there were only 12 of us runners in torino compared to 27 in beijing
9114396 it didnt look ready when i got there but within that month the transformation occurred there were still dirt roads around the birds nest but they worked around the clock flowers went up everywhere even the taxi drivers were all wearing shirts and ties im glad i got to see beijing beforehand and then the olympic version
9114397 we were allowed in parts that have never been seen by the public before so it was really cool to see that aspect of it
9114398 the olympics is a huge operation and until you experience it you dont realize the amount of work and all those other people you dont even think about putting in hours and hours of effort
9114399 czecheslovakia similarly peacefully partitioned along ethnic lines in 1992 those were not the existing internal borders
9114400 our plan is to have a demonstration scale plant operational by 2010 and in parallel well be working on the design and construction of a commercial scale facility to open in 2011

9114408 in the first two thirds of the season we didnt have a single retirement caused by any technical fault we aim bmw sauber f1team to maintain this high level of reliability on the sporting side we plan to improve further and see both cars finish solidly in the points at spa
9114409 spa may not be the track with the highest speeds that accolade belongs to monza but in spa we have the longest stretch taken at full throttle since the modification of the famous eau rouge corner and the introduction of v8 engines drivers can go flat out through the section from the hairpin shortly after the start through the hollow and then uphill again
9114410 in last years race we calculated that our drivers held the pedal to the floor for more than 1 865 metres or 24 seconds engine power and stability are key requirements here

9114427 there have been a few people who have hit the ceiling unexpectedly
9114428 david zuma respected the states criminal justice system despite its blatant injustice against him nowhere did he criticise it publicly or fight against it our criminal justice system has collapsed in terms of its efficiency its important for david and his colleagues to restore confidence in it
9114429 the consolidation of power in the hands of a few
9114430 centralisation of power has also lead to a centralisation of thought
9114431 people beginning to say and think what the president says and thinks
9114432 if george w bush was seeking re election wed be 20 points ahead
9114433 in arizona the only way to get around is by small private plane
9114434 we coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states
9114435 this is a nonsensical argument 50 of mbekis cabinet members are leaders of the anc they are national executive committee members what is the expectation that we exclude these people from the anc
9114436 one of our key documents the strategy and tactics document says the role of the anc is to unite our people
9114437 but two days after he was elected the npa national prosecuting authority announced that they were charging him
9114438 that is why people say this is a political trial in addition he initially faced two charges but they added others strengthening fears that he is being persecuted
9114439 you cant have police who also have powers to prosecute you need checks and balances
9114440 at the moment the scorpions can charge you and go and investigate later it is wrong
9114441 we met and issued a joint statement and the matter was resolved
9114442 we must appreciate that these institutions of the judiciary must have a life way beyond their current incumbents
9114443 she has supported oil drilling in some of the most ecologically sensitive areas in alaska even when it meant sacrificing polar bears beluga whales and the arctic national wildlife refuge
9114444 despite her advocacy for expanded oil and gas drilling palin has done almost nothing to promote the clean energy sources that can help solve global warming which is already having major negative consequences in her state
9114445 its been a long time since weve had a police chief process

9114449 its critical that from now to the election all of the republican candidates get as much name recognition and as much publicity as possible
9114450 the broadly unanticipated behavior of world bond markets remains a conundrum
9114451 mortgages are now considered riskier than they used to be
9114452 thats one of the biggest factors in this credit crunch
9114453 to me it says the banks are holding more of the profits on these mortgages to make up for the losses that theyve experienced over the last several years
9114454 if were not in any rush is another couple of weeks going to make any difference

9114462 the secret service said yesterday that we have set the standard for how a convention in terms of security should be run
9114463 we had a couple instances out there where unnecessary force was alleged
9114464 we immediately took action and looked at those allegations to determine if a case needed to be opened in our internal affairs

9114468 wed have red rotten tomatoes and green tomatoes we worked hard enough during the year we had to have some fun
9114469 we used to wash every single tomato and wed pull off the stem and then hed put his seal on it and then theyd sell it at the market
9114470 knowing that we had all the open space to run around in kids dont have that luxury today
9114471 a lot of times wed sit on the riverbank count the trains on the nashua side and it was nothing to count 200 cars
9114472 when you drove up the road your eyes were drawn to it it was a gentlemans farm
9114473 the land is privately owned the business needs to expand hudson doesnt have a historic district its a free enterprise and lets be real its an old house
9114474 we dont need to stop except for gas and food
9114475 its like a one big gravy train human body shuffle you just take as many people in your truck as you can they usually shuffle down a bunch of greyhound buses
9114476 thats why we dont hear a lot about rita the response was overwhelming from an ems standpoint and a lot of people were served very well which wasnt the case with katrina
9114477 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9114478 i was expecting five sets i was there for four and five but he wasnt there anymore
9114479 he is the biggest player for sure nadal is playing good tennis this year but for me federer is the best one
9114480 i dont think its affected a whole lot of matches i dont know how many times its saved a match because thats what its there for really but at the big tournaments at the big courts usually you have the best linespeople as well
9114481 the worst linespeople are usually on the outside courts where you need it more thats the problem with the system
9114482 as long as im doing the splits that means im healthy
9114483 when im not doing the splits you know theres something wrong
9114484 im not too sure about my body if i go into a split who knows if ill come back up
9114485 i wish i didnt have any drama in my matches i wish i would win nice and in a simple way
9114486 who likes drama do you know anybody that likes to get involved into tight matches
9114487 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
9114488 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
9114489 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
9114490 i feel a lot better now though because at least i know i will have a home to come back to
9114491 its like youve been slapped so hard in the past that you can almost still feel it i just know how much work it was rebuilding everything
9114492 it allows them to get their heavy trucks through the intersection
9114493 our biggest fear has always been that it gives a false sense of security if there are multiple users
9114494 implementing the system has reduced the ambulance accident rate by more than 90 percent
9114495 they just cant assume if you flip the switch then youre getting the green light drivers will have to be educated
9114496 this is the first serious accident that weve had hopefully it will be the last
9114497 america may not know much about sarah palin but based on what our community has seen of her we know enough
9114498 sarah palin not only supported the 1998 alaska constitutional amendment banning marriage equality but in her less than two years as governor even expressed the extreme position of supporting stripping away domestic partner benefits for state workers when you cant even support giving our community the rights to health insurance and pension benefits its a frightening window into where she stands on equality
9114499 alaska governor sarah palin can help sen mccain win this election by appealing to independent and young voters shes a mainstream republican who will unite the party and serve john mccain well as vice president gov palin is an inclusive republican who will help sen mccain appeal to gay and lesbian voters
9114500 changes in the role of the governing body and my personal commitments have hindered my performance and ability to effectively represent the citizens of the town of merrimack
9114501 let me close by offering my sincere appreciation for all of the kindness support and opportunities given by so many of you during my thirty five years of service to the town
9114502 her service and contributions to the community are well known
9114503 it was an extremely difficult decision for her and we respect that we accepted her resignation with deep regret she did bring a lot to the table and we wished her well in the future
9114504 to me it was a pleasure to serve with betty
9114505 i learned a ton from her she kept order she came in after taxes had come up almost 40 percent and she helped make merrimack livable again
9114506 i dont know how betty found the time to sleep she did so much
9114507 but the biggest thing the town will lose is that people no matter who they were always felt that when betty was involved things were under control they knew she did her homework and the heavy lifting
9114508 im sorry that we werent able to succeed in accomplishing what our goal was which was keeping baseball here in nashua
9114509 i think stabile is belly aching because he is down in the housing industry
9114510 it is the same story every year and you know what john i am sorry sales are down i think it is great that the community has a baseball team but if you dont want it sell it we will get along fine
9114511 this is not a city that supports this type of venue
9114512 in other cities and small towns the team would be embraced as opposed to nashua where it is barely noticed
9114513 young professionals are part of the crowd that would attend those games
9114514 this city needs to figure out what its mission is
9114515 there are so many things that work in other cities that dont work here
9114516 id rather have something in there than have an empty stadium because i dont want all the riff raff
9114517 i think that nashua benefits from having a professional ball team in the community
9114518 it provides such a great opportunity for families and others to come together
9114519 my goal is to try to keep something in that beautiful stadium
9114520 so hopefully those long passes and runs will all go for touchdowns so we dont have to worry about getting up there and getting a play off in time
9114521 our offensive coordinators and coaching staffs like this because in the past youre always at the mercy of each referee being a little different each crew being a little different now were consistent
9114522 the offensive team can come up and snap it with 39 seconds on the clock or they can let it run all the way down to 1 the offensive team determines the pace at which theyre going to operate not the official
9114523 what i told doug is i want to see where are you going to get the ball ready as opposed to when that 40 seconds starts and how much time do i really have
9114524 if were no huddling people i want that ball and i want our team over that ball with 33 seconds am i going to be able to do it can i snap it with 33 seconds can i speed the game up or can i significantly slow the game down with a 40 second clock
9114525 we practice that hustling getting downfield coming back and looking out for somebody to come in for us if were being substituted for
9114526 coach always urges us to get out of the huddle and get to the line fast so it wont be anything to us were accustomed and probably already adapted
9114527 im just going to try to score because i know those guys dont want to run

9114536 largely i was regarded as a lunatic who would never prevail against the irs
9114537 yes four more years of the same thing times two
9114538 going there we werent expecting very much we didnt want to get our hopes up too high and be let down
9114539 before we left she was having hundreds a day so many that you couldnt even keep count now she has maybe 5 sometimes on a bad day shell have ten seizures it is an amazing improvement
9114540 now when i play with her sing to her read to her she tries to vocalize to me she just has a completely different facial expression her eyes just light up and just looks like she feels so much better

9114548 knowing that he died in such a horrible way really hurts
9114549 my heart is broken i just dont know what to do with myself
9114550 he just wasnt the type who thought before he did things
9114551 my wife and i are determined to find out we will pursue the matter no matter how much it takes

9114590 i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
9114591 but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves
9114592 thats the promise of america the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
9114593 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
9114594 you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq
9114595 john mccain likes to say that hell follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
9114596 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
9114597 there is a subtext of male violence to american politics
9114598 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington but when you get to know her youre going to be as impressed as i am
9114599 hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9114600 governor palin not only stands with john mccain in his belief that global warming is a critical issue that must be addressed but she has been a leader in addressing climate change
9114601 he also wished her good luck but not too much luck
9114602 on his 72nd birthday this is the guys judgment of who he wants one heartbeat from the presidency
9114603 shes going to learn national security at the foot of the master for the next four years and most doctors think that hell be around at least that long

9114642 nada foi quebrado nenhum ve culo foi danificado e ningu m foi agredido fisicamente
9114643 recognized leader in the appraisal and disposition of industrial and commercial assets
9114644 if all theyre going to do is come in and strip the assets that makes the town vulnerable because it has a lesser amount of assets
9114645 and talk about formulating a game plan on what to do with the property
9114646 to discuss our future options and put together a game plan to redevelop groveton
9114647 he was fine but we wanted to make sure he wasnt overcome by the fumes
9114648 i was standing next to three of them and they were fine
9114649 the way the economy is going im sure people agree their salaries havent increased 17 percent
9114650 are we getting efficiencies out of contracts we have are we getting results we pay for out of them i want to make sure we are
9114651 ill travel anyplace people would want an executive councilor to travel to hear their concerns
9114652 im looking for those good solutions that come from having the best information available on how business or government works
9114653 im running looking for free thinkers republicans and independents who want to join in and do some collaborative leadership some positive things in office thats my only motive
9114654 theres a great deal of money to be saved when the bid process works properly
9114655 i think the members are slanted toward his way of thinking things should be a little more open than that
9114656 the executive council should act as a bellwether to say what we think about it thats not to say we micromanage things i dont want to fight with the governor i want to work with him he said
9114657 when the toll raises enough to amortize the costs then back off i dont think people mind paying a toll when they see the work being done
9114658 enjoy this win hey central is supposed to be one of the best teams in division i
9114659 we can compete if we execute they executed much better than we did
9114660 it certainly wasnt hard to get the kids excited to play last night
9114661 theres a lot of people that are well known and theyre working very hard
9114662 i can say the democratic primary would on paper be a very low turnout event simply because there arent really high profile races on the ballot
9114663 i got blown up twice in iraq im just a little bit timid right now and the way the officers approached me im on guard
9114664 i just never thought i would be doing anything like this so its been kind of a whirlwind experience
9114665 its not passion for politics its not passion for political opportunism its actual passion for the values we all believe in
9114666 this is not about electing sen obama its about changing ourselves
9114667 theres so much positive energy on the ground here were just talking about the platform and this new kind of politics were creating this is almost like a changing of the guard in a way its an entire new generation thats coming in
9114668 its obviously not how we expected her college career to go
9114669 but her professors have been really great so kudos to unh
9114670 they were like you need to calm down you need to think about this and then in the fall my mom had this amazing transition and she was calling me with poll results
9114671 the more i hear about her the more i like her
9114672 ive been saying for months she would be the perfect choice
9114673 she is a working mother of five kids juggling it all she is an average person a union member who worked on a fishing boat with her husband and a mayor of a town where she reformed taxation and shes squeaky clean she brings so much to the table and wraps it up by being a pro life social conservative
9114674 shes acceptable to the conservatives in the party based of her stance on social issues and she gives women a reason to engage in this election because theres a woman on the ticket they have just done the single thing that could reset this race after obamas speech
9114675 id say theyve gotten the better of obama all summer
9114676 this is a very aggressive pick high risk high reward obama played it safe i think its a roll of the dice but i think it was a smart roll of the dice for mccain
9114677 in many ways where hillary clinton left off sarah palin picked up
9114678 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9114679 but what will matter most to voters this fall is who can take our country in a new economic direction
9114680 john mccain and sarah palin like john sununu are only offering more of the same failed bush policies that have gotten us where we are today
9114681 doesnt just talk about change shes shaken up the system and america is better served as a result of her hard work
9114682 as a woman she will give many independents and democrats an opportunity to seriously consider the republican ticket
9114683 a young and dynamic leader who has earned a reputation as a reformer by taking on the establishment and will help sen mccain bring true change and reform to washington
9114684 she knows the struggles of americans today and the need to find solutions for high energy prices and spiraling debt
9114685 gov palin is a famed fiscal conservative and a maverick in her own right we need tough action in washington and gov palin will certainly bring that to the table
9114686 as a former sportscaster and both a mom and governor of alaska she has shown that we can break through the glass ceiling while we are reminded that america continues to be the place of opportunity
9114687 governor palin has proven conservative credentials a strong record of reform and personal experiences that broaden the depth and appeal of the ticket
9114688 although pesticide exposure is one of four theoretical factors associated with ccd that the united states department of agriculture is researching the facts in this case are not consistent with what is known about ccd
9114689 a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9114690 i feel very wise and sage but at the same time very young
9114691 i love composing i am also raising my children and enjoying it and teaching them to ride bicycles and how to read i love it i let them go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things i want them to get to do the kind of things i didnt get to do
9114692 weve got the lowest taxes and highest level of services in north texas
9114693 he reported to the king on the current situation and he will return to bangkok today
9114694 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
9114695 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow
9114696 to go back to where i came from get that hunger back
9114697 i know i had to pass garcia before i could think about molitor but ive been waiting for this fight for a long time
9114698 in the screenplay an evil presidential candidate chooses the american he thinks is the least likely to catch on to his nefarious plans to destroy the country
9114699 enter goldie a former beauty pageant contestant small town mayor and hockey mom
9114700 she turns out to be smarter than she looks and exposes her running mate on national tv becoming president herself in the process
9114701 in real life if gov palin becomes president she will most likely ban abortions destroy wildlife habitats and blow up the world

9114704 weve been able to pick things that offer the biggest value
9114705 a strong indication of the macro environment getting a lot worse
9114706 especially since a lot of times the whole scene can at times be exploitive of women and body image i thought it would be interesting to show how thats not always the case and heres an example of a situation where there is a directly postive result in terms of helping womens rights

9114729 patriotism is supporting your country all the time and your government when it deserves it
9114730 a democracy is nothing more than mob rule where fifty one percent of the people may take away the rights of the other forty nine
9114731 those who desire to give up freedom in order to gain security will not have nor do they deserve either one

9114737 you may say im a dreamer but im not the only one i hope someday you will join us and the world will live as one
9114738 as a result of these developments our legal team and i no longer believe we can be successful with this litigation
9114739 we are pleased to now be able to move on we look forward to an exciting future of nba basketball in oklahoma city
9114740 we have received feedback that a continuing adversarial relationship with the nba was not politically useful to the citys ongoing efforts to secure a future franchise
9114741 thus the prevailing wisdom of many in the seattle community and the advice of key members of the bcos is that seattles best chance for a professional basketball franchise is to end this litigation and allow the city state legislature and other parties to begin the necessary fence mending with the nba
9114742 it was very disappointing not being able to move forward with an effective strategy
9114743 at some point in life you have to look and see if you can achieve your goals it was not a good plan

9114761 he is not a muslim and he says that but i am a muslim and if i was running for office would it be right to hold that against me

9114763 keith took the heat and the shots before me he took the pain though they came gunning for me too
9114764 muslims needs to be engaged more actively in public life in our country where are our muslim councilors where are our muslim mayors
9114765 we have a message muslim americans are as american as apple pie
9114766 ignoring us is the politics of exclusion and exclusion i would suggest is un american
9114767 es hora de que aprendas la lecci n que has venido a aprender
9114768 qu has hecho qu lecci n es sta que amerita dejar a esta familia en la ruina total c mo has podido matar esta pobre vaca que representaba lo nico que pose a esta familia
9114769 i am honored to be here tonight a proud mother a proud democrat a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
9114770 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
9114771 to my supporters my champions my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits from the bottom of my heart thank you you never gave in you never gave up and together we made history
9114772 i ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years those are the reasons i ran for president those are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
9114773 i cant wait to watch barack obama sign a healthcare plan into law that covers every single american
9114774 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47m people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and in 2008 he still thinks it is okay when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
9114775 all of the things that are going on in the economy arent just by happen stance
9114776 they are a direct result of policies that george bush and john mccain have put in place and now there answer is lets keep on doing the same thing
9114777 one thing i have said several times when i have been with obama is that he really showed a lot of composure against the karl rove style unrelenting attacks
9114778 the most incredible opportunity any president and vice president will have since franklin roosevelt
9114779 that all changed in 1960 when kennedy chose lyndon johnson as his running mate
9114780 will make the next president cautious about giving the vice president too much authority
9114781 one thing is clear biden does nothing to brighten obamas prospects in the electoral college
9114782 if for some reason obama is incapacitated or perish the thought dies in office people know he would be a competent president
9114783 the office of vice president has changed forever the office has explicit legal powers now maybe some will be rolled back but they cant be rolled back easily the template of being a big player in foreign affairs is established
9114784 all vice presidents since walter mondale vice president from 1977 81 have played a more important role than had historically been the case i look for biden to play a role more like al gore to clinton
9114785 hes a rudder he has a handle on the bureaucracy and knows how to get things done
9114786 okay i wanna see how many people can fit into this phonebooth the last record was 11 lets see how many we can fit this time

9114827 for a retail price of 230 the 9950 is an interesting choice from amd this has driven the price of the 9850 black edition down to the 200 level in 1000 unit quantities the 9950 performs higher than the 9850 across the board as to be expected from a cpu that doesnt have any architectural differences than the higher clock speed over the older cpu for those wanting performance but at an affordable cost the 9950 does well for the target area its aimed at it plays games runs photoshop and works with all media without a problem not the fastest cpu in the world but neither is it a lag dog

9114841 in his encyclical letter centesimus annus pope john paul ii wrote not only has god given the earth to man who must use it with respect for the original good purpose for which it was given to him but man too is gods gift to man he must therefore respect the natural and moral structure with which he has been endowed 6 by responding to this charge entrusted to them by the creator men and women can join in bringing about a world of peace alongside the ecology of nature there exists what can be called a human ecology which in turn demands a social ecology all this means that humanity if it truly desires peace must be increasingly conscious of the links between natural ecology or respect for nature and human ecology experience shows that disregard for the environment always harms human coexistence and vice versa it becomes more and more evident that there is an inseparable link between peace with creation and peace among men both of these presuppose peace with god the poem prayer of saint francis known as the canticle of brother sun is a wonderful and ever timely example of this multifaceted ecology of peace
9114842 climate can reach points such that amplifying feedbacks spur large rapid changes arctic sea ice is a current example global warming initiated sea ice melt exposing darker ocean that absorbs more sunlight melting more ice as a result without any additional greenhouse gases the arctic soon will be ice free in the summer more ominous tipping points loom west antarctic and greenland ice sheets are vulnerable to even small additional warming these two mile thick behemoths respond slowly at first but if disintegration gets well under way it will become unstoppable debate among scientists is only about how much sea level would rise by a given date in my opinion if emissions follow a business as usual scenario sea level rise of at least two meters is likely within a century hundreds of millions of people would become refugees and no stable shoreline would be reestablished in any time frame that humanity can conceive the tipping point for life on the planet will occur when so many interdependent species are lost that ecosystems collapse the shocking conclusion documented in a paper i have written with several of the worlds leading climate experts is that the safe level of atmospheric carbon dioxide is no more than 350 ppm parts per million and it may be less carbon dioxide amount is already 385 ppm and rising about 2 ppm per year shocking corollary the oft stated goal to keep global warming less than two degrees celsius 3 6 degrees fahrenheit is a recipe for global disaster not salvation

9114845 when the european union eu first established its emissions trading system large numbers of carbon credits were handed out free to established emitters when the oversupply of credits became obvious prices collapsed the right to pollute was now super cheap and all incentive to invest in cutting emissions vanished
9114846 very explicit that such a radical mitigation of the problem should not be attempted the costs to the world economy of ensuring that atmospheric co2 stabilized at present levels or below would be prohibitive destabilizing capitalism itself paths requiring very rapid emissions cuts we are told are unlikely to be economically viable if global greenhouse gas emissions peaked in 2010 the annual emissions reduction rate necessary to stabilize atmospheric carbon at 450 ppm the stern review suggests would be 7 percent with emissions dropping by about 70 percent below 2005 levels by 2050 this is viewed as economically insupportable

9114859 i more than suspect that the mccain campaign want their people energized by the fact that theyre fighting a battle against the media
9114860 i read conservative blog sites they are up in arms about this coverage and i think thats going to be part of the dialogue
9114861 the audience probably knows most of the things we could tell them about obama by the time he gets to the stadium
9114862 they wont know that much about mccain because they werent listening even if we were telling them this is an opportunity for us to basically fill in the blanks and lets face it hes got a pretty compelling story himself

9114911 obviously paul has done the job everything weve asked i dont know yet lets see where we go
9114912 you can lose a game in the first inning just like you can lose it in the ninth
9114913 i wasnt going to get down on myself after the first
9114914 its easy to do that i just wanted to put it behind me take it slow take it easy just focus on the next guy
9114915 the first inning obviously was a struggle but he settled down
9114916 after that he was about as efficient as hes been all year
9114917 abuse affects all of us because when we send a child to school we expect hell be well looked after
9114918 your ball can literally roll halfway back to the tee box
9114919 get a decent drive in the fairway and its a short iron in but like a lot of holes out here it looks intimidating its hard to play when youre intimidated
9114920 evansville native and former pga tour player brian tennyson played here a month ago and reached in two he hit a hybrid on his second shot and played it just right a little cut right over the bunker to four feet knocked the putt in for eagle
9114921 its a big hit at 233 yards but i think its a good hole
9114922 some par 3s are so long now its almost absurd but this hole isnt theres a place to bail out on the right you can chip and putt for par if you dont reach it
9114923 when you stand on that tee you basically have to decide how big a man you want to be
9114924 if you take off a big chunk of that lake its a short iron in and a chance at a birdie

9114938 for the last 40 years everyone has been trying to poke holes in it but they keep coming back to this being the most transparent way to capture the essence of the market
9114939 looking at our returns theyre going to underperform in a highly growth dominated market like weve seen in the past 12 months
9114940 my first time out i was a little nervous but once you get out there and play your first three or four plays you dont have time to be nervous
9114941 a blocked punt a snap went over the punters head you cant do that against football teams
9114942 i think when spenser went out we lost a lot of our rhythm offensively
9114943 i wouldnt say it was something that the coaches and not something that one individual did wrong
9114944 we had a few avoidable bad breaks everything we did was avoidable and we just gave it away there in the second half
9114945 when we get into our own bit of water and clear of the fleet a bit we know that we are very fast downwind and seem always able to get places we have good sails and good crew work
9114946 thierry is very good and this is our second event with him we do a lot of research and prepared a good strategy before each race here and try to stick to it with a clear plan
9114947 in general the boats at the fifth generation are very closely matched the gains to be made by new boats here are small
9114948 its disappointing the last race is particularly painful because the guys are working their tails off and everyone is putting in 101 we havent sailed this boat in these conditions a lot i think i have to look at our technique re evaluate our sails and setup looking at matador and artemis very fast downwind we have to evaluate all we are doing and continuing our game rate on an upwards curve its a test of our will weve had some knocks in the past and we bounced back so we have to take some knocks now we will get up swinging
9114949 the great teams the championship teams they have good special teams
9114950 we told our starters theyre going to be on special teams
9114951 were also more committed to the running game were committed to it as part of our identity
9114952 i told him i knew hed be a little rough at the start
9114953 but i knew hed rise above it i knew hed do well
9114954 when they do everything the right way you want them to get the w but one game doesnt make a season
9114955 seven wins should be enough to get into the countback but im not sure that it will be good enough for us to get through well need to go out there and disappoint the locals tomorrow and beat peter wibroe
9114956 we had a good day and sailed better and better every race it was not an easy morning but we kept improving the tactics today were great as it was very tricky the wind was shifty and the pressure was up and down a lot we didnt focus so much on the opponent we looked for the wind instead it was nice to beat ian williams we got a good shift and pressure and managed to sail away from him the round is not finished yet so we will be happy to make the final four
9114957 with two of the guys a bit crook today was a bit of a struggle
9114958 we got the first shift off the line and got ahead but up the second beat we got an over rider on the jib sheet that we had to cut out and lost some time jesper caught up and so we had to dial him down pretty hard we were right on the edge of a penalty we managed to keep the right but he rounded the mark on our hip and after a bad gybe he got the march on us we just kept the overlap and carted him off to the bottom corner of the course just missing the obstruction line along the shore we had to take him a long
9114959 its all really close and definitely too hard to call we have a few new guys in the team this week and staffan rahm hasnt sailed in a year so we are trying to pull it all together i also need to try and improve my starts
9114960 we had a close match with johnie berntsson he got a penalty for hitting the start mark but edged ahead and led us around the course it was really close down the last run he tried to hook us to offload the penalty but we managed to soak below him and get to the line leaving him still carrying the penalty
9114961 we mucked up a few today including one against ian williams when he passed us upwind it was very shifty and harder to read today than yesterday we sailed a lot more defensively
9114962 we had a good race against peter wibroe we were ahead but he caught a good shift and passed us we fought hard downwind and he luffed and hit us and a result got his second penalty of the match which gave us the lead along with the win it was a bit of a scramble though
9114963 i think it is still open nobody has straight wins but we must win all three tomorrow if we are to make the cut it would have been nice to end today 5 3 but we are where we are we have a new crew combination but they are working very well we like the conditions and it has been exciting racing it is vital to work the pressure and if you are ahead to push your opponent away from the breeze we focused on trying to sail our own race and keep a loose cover when ahead we are also going to try not to involve the umpires as we have had some tight manoeuvres that have resulted in decisions going against us
9114964 we need to get better starts when we were behind we gained on the other team all the way around and had really close finishes with torvar mirsky and sebastien col we are really happy with our speed and i think if we can get an even start with ian tomorrow we can win we feel great and are looking forward to it

9114971 of course its up to them but we all remember the precedents that we have in history lets remember how u s troops entered iraq and what they did with saddam hussein for destroying several shiite villages here ten ossetian villages were destroyed right out
9114972 arent you aware of whats been going on in georgia in the last few years the mysterious death of prime mnister zhvania fighting with the opposition the violent dispersal of protest demonstrations holding a national election during a practical state of emergency and now this criminal action in south ossetia with many casualties you call it a democratic country negotiating with it and thinking it should be admitted to nato and the eu
9114973 we dont have any special rules of our own by which we are going to play we want everybody to play by the same rules these are called international law but we dont want anyone manipulating them playing it one way in one region and another way in another region to suit their own interests we want to have the same rules for everyone which would take into account the interests of all members of the international community

9114984 first time ever that is something no one can take from these girls that they beat a team with a tradition like st henry i am very very happy
9114985 weve been looking for that big win over a mac power its been a long time coming and it was as much mental as anything you hope this carries forward from here for the rest of our season
9114986 she had no kills the first game thats trouble for us because shes one of our best hitters
9114987 you just hope and hope she eventually gets going we also had no blocks the first two games and thats the strength of our team the first two games they dictated to us and made us do all the moving st henry was a lot better than i thought theyd be but thats a credit to their program even when you think they are down theyre still good
9114988 slowly slowly we started turning it around we started to do what we know
9114989 we got some blocks and that always helps we began moving the ball around their block and making them move
9114990 ive coached here six years and that was the best defense ive seen from my teams the defense was phenomenal start to finish
9114991 we were digging like crazy and just doing what we had to it reminded me of when these seniors were unbeaten in the eighth grade theyd come in calm cool and relaxed and then go out and play their hearts out this is the type of win that can set the tone for the rest of the season

9114996 oh theres some chocolate how convenient now on to the next e mail
9114997 were going to see how he does tomorrow facing the hitters
9114998 the one thing that weve done is we have not rushed this and we have not tried to get ahead of ourselves we wont do that after tomorrows performance well make an evaluation to see if the next step is that he needs more time or we can activate him
9114999 we couldnt necessarily bring him back as a starter if we activated him right away just because hes not built up
9115000 i would have loved to have him back three weeks ago but thats not the case we had to deal with an injury and hes been feeling pretty good we all feel good about that well make a decision sometime this weekend
9115001 this year it is actually worse i have been here 54 years and i have never seen the water so low the situation so bad

9115059 i could not believe how comfortable i felt wearing this undergarment i had no chaffing or rubbing it just worked perfectly and for the first time i was warm
9115060 they forced us out of how we wanted to play
9115061 we came out really flat tonight and it really showed i think we came out a little too confident and owen county took it right at us and they did what they had to
9115062 our passes werent where they were supposed to be we were a little off in our passing
9115063 and nearly did in the final minutes shots by claus and jordan kendall in front of the goal sailed high
9115064 we left them in the game we never put them away
9115065 by doing that owen county got more and more confidence they started going faster and getting to the balls more and our legs seemed tired already and we just never got to the ball
9115066 i have been very pleased with our effort and our focus weve done a lot of maturing this offseason i think the 3 8 season was an eye opener for our guys i think it created a drive and a little bit more emphasis for them to pay attention to the details that the coaches stress
9115067 they have a new coach who has been here with me for the last three years
9115068 were very familiar with coach boykin one of the things that ive always stressed as a head coach is that you have to adjust to the personnel and the players that you have i think that coach boykin will come up with a plan that he feels will fit the players that he has
9115069 i think theyll do quite a bit of the same things that theyve done in the past with his own twist
9115070 hell come and try a couple of trick plays hell try some tricky stuff on special teams because hes naturally a special teams guy we just hope we can weather the storm and be productive and make sure we simply take care of our end
9115071 regardless of who the opponent is we have to find a way to have some success early
9115072 weve got to try to get some completions weve got to have a couple of runs where our guys can get going and get some emotion and some enthusiasm were going to try and make an effort to start quick
9115073 my intention is to play two quarterbacks in the first game jerrell noland will be second we will get him at least two series in the game planning for down the road just in case something were to happen to the starting quarterback
9115074 he understands what we want form an execution standpoint he understands how to get us in and out of the correct plays based on how the defense lines up he has the best understanding of where guys are supposed to be
9115075 my goal is to get the ball to people who can make plays for us
9115076 weve got three or four wide receivers who have proven they can make plays for us and a couple of guys who have come in as transfers and freshmen who also can handle getting the ball we have a lot of options on offense
9115077 our starting tight end is going to be a freshman named jovan washington from cleveland ohio
9115078 he is a really talented young man who has been one of the pleasant surprises of camp
9115079 defensively we are going to try and keep it simple for our players
9115080 our point of emphasis is to put our kids in situations where they know what theyre doing and they can play fast and they can play physical
9115081 as the season grew on last year we were tentative in a lot of areas
9115082 our kids were unsure my goal was to try to find a defensive scheme that would allow us to get some comfort to where they knew for certain where they were supposed to be how they were supposed to do it and they can play fast
9115083 what i hope to see us do on defense is to settle in
9115084 there will still be that first quarter of the first game of the season where guys are going to be nervous and make some mistakes hopefully we can survive those mistakes
9115085 we have to find a way to make special teams a weapon
9115086 we want to control field position if we have to punt i want to make sure that were changing the field position to give our defense a long field to protect and our punt return team i want them to create a short field for our offense to have a better opportunity to score
9115087 this game will be a great opportunity for us to show what type of football team we have
9115088 last year was a disappointment in a number of ways i made some decisions in the offseason that i think will benefit this program
9115089 on saturday i hope that our fans in this community will come out and support our football team
9115090 weve had mental lapses here and there we only had the one tonight with the goal id like to have a shutout every time we come out on the pitch
9115091 whoa it was a good night in goal for him
9115092 what we tried to do this game in the first half we tried to match up strength for strength
9115093 we tried to play more fullback and defensive oriented we played four backs and a sweeper to give us five in the back
9115094 in the second half we wanted to change some things up
9115095 we wanted to have some speed in the back with the core of our team in the upper half of the field we started seeing things happening
9115096 it would have been a 3 2 game i truly thought that was the turning point there was our momentum we were unlucky on that one that one was questionable but in high school soccer you have to live and learn
9115097 fhs made some adjustments on defense in the second half
9115098 instead of playing 4 4 2 they went to a 5 4 1 and pulled a guy back which took some of our offense it was hard for us to get shots they put some faster players back there as well because bryce was breaking through
9115099 i havent won it since i have been head coach and i am ready to take it this year i think the kids are too this is a group of kids that havent beat western hills since this is my third year as head coach and i am ready to take it to them
9115100 were playing a team that weve already beaten once this season and now we have to play them with a real big win i take my hat off to jerry doolin and his owen county rebels i think it took them 11 years to get that win over western hills
9115101 weve got to come out to play if we come out thinking that all we have to do is show up were going to come out in fourth place in this tournament

9115145 at the highest hf powers available in the west the instabilities commonly studied are approaching their maximum rf energy dissipative capability beyond which the plasma processes will runaway until the next limiting factor is reached
9115146 the military is going to give the ionosphere a big kick and see what happens
9115147 method and apparatus for altering a region in the earths atmosphere ionosphere and or magnetosphere
9115148 thus this invention provides the ability to put unprecedented amounts of power in the earths atmosphere at strategic locations and to maintain the power injection level particularly if random pulsing is employed in a manner far more precise and better controlled than heretofore accomplished by the prior art particularly by detonation of nuclear devices of various yields at various altitudes
9115149 it is possible not only to interfere with third party communications but to take advantage of one or more such beams to carry out a communications network even though the rest of the worlds communications are disrupted put another way what is used to disrupt anothers communications can be employed by one knowledgeable of this invention as a communication network at the same time
9115150 large regions of the atmosphere could be lifted to an unexpectedly high altitude so that missiles encounter unexpected and unplanned drag forces with resultant destruction
9115151 weather modification is possible by for example altering upper atmosphere wind patterns by constructing one or more plumes of atmospheric particles which will act as a lens or focusing device molecular modifications of the atmosphere can take place so that positive environmental effects can be achieved besides actually changing the molecular composition of an atmospheric region a particular molecule or molecules can be chosen for increased presence for example ozone nitrogen etc concentrations in the atmosphere could be artificially increased
9115152 political strategists are tempted to exploit research on the brain and human behavior geophysicist gordon j f macdonald a specialist in problems of warfare says accurately timed artificially excited electronic strokes could lead to a pattern of oscillations that produce relatively high power levels over certain regions of the earth in this way one could develop a system that would seriously impair the brain performance of very large populations in selected regions over an extended period
9115153 no matter how deeply disturbing the thought of using the environment to manipulate behavior for national advantages to some the technology permitting such use will very probably develop within the next few decades
9115154 the key to geophysical warfare is the identification of environmental instabilities to which the addition of a small amount of energy would release vastly greater amounts of energy
9115155 unhindered by the restraints of traditional liberal values this elite would not hesitate to achieve its political ends by using the latest modern techniques for influencing public behavior and keeping society under close surveillance and control technical and scientific momentum would then feed on the situation it exploits
9115156 the potential applications of artificial electromagnetic fields are wide ranging and can be used in many military or quasi military situations some of these potential uses include dealing with terrorist groups crowd control controlling breaches of security at military installations and antipersonnel techniques in tactical warfare in all of these cases the em electromagnetic systems would be used to produce mild to severe physiological disruption or perceptual distortion or disorientation in addition the ability of individuals to function could be degraded to such a point that they would be combat ineffective another advantage of electromagnetic systems is that they can provide coverage over large areas with a single system they are silent and countermeasures to them may be difficult to develop one last area where electromagnetic radiation may prove of some value is in enhancing abilities of individuals for anomalous phenomena
9115157 youre pumping tremendous energy into an extremely delicate molecular configuration that comprises these multi layers we call the ionosphere
9115158 if a small part is changed a major change in the ionosphere can happen
9115159 haarp high frequency emissions can couple with longwave extremely low frequency or elf pulses the earth grid uses to distribute information as vibrations to synchronize dances of life in the biosphere
9115160 haarp will not burn holes in the ionosphere that is a dangerous understatement of what haarps giant gigawatt beam will do earth is spinning relative to thin electric shells of the multilayer membrane of ion o speres that absorb and shield earths surface from intense solar radiation including charged particle storms in solar winds erupting from the sun earths axial spin means that haarp in a burst lasting more than a few minutes will slice through the ionosphere like a microwave knife this produces not a hole but a long tear an incision
9115161 effects of this interference with symphonies of gaias geomagnetic harp are unknown and i suspect barely thought of
9115162 among other researchers quoted is paul schaefer of kansas city
9115163 but most of the theories that we have been taught by scientists to believe in seem to be falling apart
9115164 one might compare the abnormal energetic state of the earth and its atmosphere to a car battery which has become overcharged with the normal flow of energy jammed up resulting in hot spots electrical arcing physical cracks and general turbulence as the pent up energy tries to find some place to go
9115165 unless we desire the death of our planet we must end the production of unstable particles which are generating the earths fever a first priority to prevent this disaster would be to shut down all nuclear power plants and end the testing of atomic weapons electronic warfare and star wars
9115166 these precipitated particles can produce secondary ionization emit x rays and cause significant perturbation in the lower ionosphere
9115167 using environmental modification techniques to destroy damage or injure another state are prohibited
9115168 compels a reexamination of this sensitive and potentially risky topic
9115169 ways to manipulate the charges of the earth and sky and so affect the weather
9115170 the key to geophysical warfare is the identification of environmental instabilities to which the addition of a small amount of energy would release vastly greater amounts of energy
9115171 world recognized scientist macdonald had a number of ideas for using the environment as a weapon system and he contributed to what was at the time the dream of a futurist
9115172 what emerged was an awesome picture of far ranging research and experimentation by the department of defense into ways environmental tampering could be used as a weapon
9115173 if the ionosphere is greatly disturbed the atmosphere below is subsequently disturbed
9115174 theyre like boys playing with a sharp stick finding a sleeping bear and poking it in the butt to see whats going to happen
9115175 for example while changes in the earths electric field resulting from a solar flare modulating conductivity may have only a barely detectable effect on meteorology the situation may be different in regard to electric field changes caused by manmade ionization
9115176 meteorology of course is the study of the atmosphere and weather
9115177 one look at the weather should tell us that we are on the wrong path

9115181 the way the new ballparks are being built and even some of the old ones its very difficult to put yourself in position when youre 350 feet away to see something
9115182 with the green monster in boston you have to be a giraffe to see that top ledge
9115183 i cant put myself in position within a couple of seconds to perfectly see something like that a play at the plate or a play at first base i can
9115184 with the technology over the last four or five years i kind of saw it coming at least for these types of calls
9115185 i hope it doesnt become anything more than boundary calls
9115186 in spring training he looked like he had a good arm and very good stuff
9115187 reds personnel told me hes one of those guys who starts slow and finishes strong so what you saw then is probably not what youll see now
9115188 any other matters not previously agreed upon or specifically addressed are recommended for withdrawal
9115189 a mixed bag that isnt encouraging except for the wages everything in there pretty much represents concessions on our part
9115190 we recognize that the issues are numerous and complex and they affect the lives of transit riders taxpayers and port authority employees ms riglers recommendations will be carefully analyzed and our board of directors will act on the report within the 15 day allotted time
9115191 we know that he drinks and gets behind the wheel of a car
9115192 the globe trotting chief who hired a web of family and friends
9115193 its clearly one of the most corrupt scandalous patronage laden agencies that exists
9115194 from independent professionals who look at our financial performance not political activists with an ax to grind
9115195 weve had a couple of e mails from travelers but once we explained what were doing they were somewhat more understanding
9115196 so the train isnt really out of service its just sitting in idle
9115197 were working with the transportation security administration bombardier the people mover builder and operator and our facilities operations people and constantly monitoring the situation
9115198 we will run two trains into the weekend and then early next week then go into alternating mode as traffic warrants
9115199 we do have a very close working relationship with the meadows
9115200 if the traffic today is any indication it wont be too long
9115201 please check out the new center spend lots of cash
9115202 never once ever did pat approach me approach the chairman of his board approach anyone at the ura to suggest that there was any kind of corruption or decisions being made that werent in the best interests of the residents
9115203 there are a lot of rumors and things being said right now
9115204 nobody in my office nor myself has ever been contacted by any investigatory agency
9115205 if i could say more i would but you know these are sensitive matters and it is not our intention to interfere with an investigation
9115206 if a public official has been contacted by authorities and has cooperated on matters of mutual interest you can determine whether theres an investigation or not
9115207 never once ever did pat approach me approach the chairman of his board approach anyone at the ura to suggest that there was any kind of corruption or decisions being made that werent in the best interests of the residents
9115208 i think clearly he has decided to attack others to potentially benefit himself
9115209 at this point mr ford is not going to air this administrations dirty laundry
9115210 a chance to submit a revised bid which was cheaper than trumbulls
9115211 i stand here confident that that decision and all of the decisions that have been made were made appropriately
9115212 weve awarded contracts to contributors weve awarded contracts to non contributors
9115213 the reality of the situation is that we make decisions based on who we think is the best and most responsible person
9115214 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington but when you get to know her youre going to be as impressed as i am
9115215 hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9115216 governor palin not only stands with john mccain in his belief that global warming is a critical issue that must be addressed but she has been a leader in addressing climate change
9115217 he also wished her good luck but not too much luck
9115218 on his 72nd birthday this is the guys judgment of who he wants one heartbeat from the presidency
9115219 we had to do that amount of paving in order to restore access and provide for proper drainage
9115220 its a typical driveway adjustment that we would make for anyone
9115221 it was an inquiry on behalf of a constituent nothing more
9115222 we saw how law enforcement officials in london were able to track the suspects using their surveillance system during the july 2005 terrorist attack
9115223 it will be critical because now our police officers who have data mobile units in their cars will be able to tap into the camera network and have a sense of what is going on before they get to a crime scene
9115224 the fastest way to identify violent crime and move against it
9115225 from an industry perspective were actually doing pretty good there are cities losing 15 to 30 percent and everywhere in between
9115226 you dont want to lose any service but its not as bad compared to what the industry is doing
9115227 probably made sense when crude oil was less than 120 a barrel we just cant justify operating it with the high operating costs
9115228 we believe there is demand for more than one a day
9115229 ensure that benefits to the pittsburgh community as a result of the introduction of gaming to the city would not be delayed or potentially lost
9115230 will stand in the identical shoes of pitg gaming and don barden and will carry forward with the same project and will be bound by all commitments attendant to the pitg license
9115231 our greatest fear is an adult would pass it to an infant who has not yet received the pertussis vaccine
9115232 ive been here twice now almost a year apart and each time this place has been absolutely perfect
9115233 we like kids but the dept of health doesnt but your dogs are welcome
9115234 you told me you guys wanted food you told me these tables are for people eating
9115235 im not the one who should be telling you this i shouldnt be involved at all
9115236 the release of carbon dioxide is massive in this country
9115237 a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9115238 the broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w
9115239 a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours
9115240 because defenders of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
9115241 cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9115242 set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9115243 same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
9115244 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief
9115245 with the nomination of sen barack obama tonight the man who will lead the democratic party in its march toward the white house we are making a down payment on the fulfillment of that dream
9115246 not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
9115247 even during the cold war during the harsh confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we always avoided direct clashes between our civilians even more so between our military personnel
9115248 ordinary experts even if they teach military affairs should not do so in combat zones but in training areas and training centers
9115249 what was the purpose of that gentleman being among the special forces and what is he doing today i so far cannot answer
9115250 as a follow up to my below post picking a female vp makes it very difficult for obama to execute the second part of his strategy painting mccain as the same as bush
9115251 maybe they wont notice that i am taking john mccains straight talk express campaign themes
9115252 i dont think so america knows mccain just sold out the country for a politic tactical stunt the woman has no experience on diversity of economics no national experience with any issue if the 72 year old kicks the bucket so would we as a country this woman is soooooo under qualified
9115253 now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses
9115254 sportsmen have been stereotyped as concerned with one issue guns but if you listen to sportsmen as i have over the years we hear a different story
9115255 democrats are all about conservation they are all about preservation i think thats a huge opportunity
9115256 with sen obama you have a lifetime record of supporting gun control voting for gun control speaking out against gun rights and voting against gun rights either as an elected official or a private citizen
9115257 the other 52 percent will say she damaged him too much and five or six of us will say you should have let us do our job
9115258 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to be president thats a debate id like to have
9115259 people think they can support him but hes a mystery inexperience is about not knowing him
9115260 this is one emergency that we cant drill our way out of
9115261 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9115262 innovation in both business methodology and technology is capable of having profound effects on the degree that society adopts a truly green lifestyle and so we are excited to bring clean technology and innovation together at this years west coast green
9115263 in four short years bush turned that around and we now have debt for years to come
9115264 right now we need to campaign on turning virginia from a red state to a blue state
9115265 im talking to people every day who were republicans forever but are just not able to do it this year
9115266 for years and years they bought the plan to cut taxes but the middle class now is beginning to catch up with that idea and understand that a trick has been pulled on them
9115267 i want to vote for somebody who is going to deliver what he says he is going to do
9115268 forget about the wealthy think about the people and help the middle class rather than the wealthy
9115269 we have got a good start but we have our work cut out for us all across the country
9115270 we need to bring the lost to the light and reap the harvest
9115271 this election if probably one of the most important of my grandchildrens lives
9115272 i think historically we have left behind the disadvantaged and the people the policy was developed for
9115273 i think obama has done things more than any candidate to reach out to my generation
9115274 compare that to john mccain who said he barely knew how to use the internet and had to have help from his wife
9115275 the campaign of barack obama and joe biden is a very exciting one
9115276 we want a change that is going to help us all
9115277 their strength is not only how they campaign but how they govern
9115278 were corrupting more and more people to care about this stuff
9115279 once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches this transition
9115280 the question simply put is will we seize the opportunity for a change
9115281 why is the election so close its close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
9115282 and then let us leave here tonight and take that message of hope from denver
9115283 and do everything we can to serve our nation our world and our children and their future by electing barack obama president of the united states of america
9115284 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
9115285 involved engaged and getting briefings and working to make sure that the federal assistance is there
9115286 now is the time to prepare yourself your family and your friends
9115287 one of the most important lessons we learned after hurricane katrina was that there is no substitute for awareness and self help especially in the days before a hurricane is predicted to hit
9115288 oh can you take care of her oh maybe you can spare her several moments of your consideration leading up to the final destination
9115289 oh the earth is calling out i wanna learn what its all about but everything i read global warming going green i dont know what all this means but it seems to be saying wake up america
9115290 hes a hero hes going to bring pollution down to zero
9115291 i know that you dont want to hear it especially coming from someone so young
9115292 stand up ill try if you will wake up its not a fire drill
9115293 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
9115294 because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change
9115295 hes said many times that the primary battle was historic and exciting and that in the end result it would be good for the democratic party that it would energize a lot of people and bring a lot of new people out
9115296 he expected all along that this would resolve itself elegantly and organically and it did
9115297 i think hes very happy with where we are we have a nominee a spectacular nominee and hes going to do everything he can to see him elected
9115298 we think gore can deliver a compelling message on both the economy and foreign policy as relates to energy
9115299 hes a messenger there are a lot of elected officials that voters dont readily accept information from and hes one that they do they think that hes got credibility he has some credibility because a lot of voters believe that if he were elected the last eight years would have been different
9115300 what he has said is that he is not interested in serving in a future administration but that he hasnt ruled out public office and that if he ran for office again it would probably be for president
9115301 he has found a very unique role and platform as a kind of public private citizen able to harness resources creatively to make a huge impact on the climate crisis
9115302 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
9115303 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9115304 she shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9115305 gov palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade
9115306 the last thing women need is a president and vice president who are prepared to turn back the clock on womens rights and repeal the protections of roe v wade
9115307 when as many as three supreme court justices could be appointed in the first term of the next president and john mccain promises to appoint more scalias and thomases and end a womans right to choose it is time for a change
9115308 in an era when over 80 percent of downs syndrome babies are aborted the palins feel they have been extremely blessed by god to raise an absolutely perfect son
9115309 gov palin continues to use her testimony to advance protections for unborn children
9115310 will i get a nominee who will keep his word to me in the vetting process if any word is actually given
9115311 we all know that dance nobody actually admits they ask the roe question and the question doesnt get asked and it doesnt get answered and therefore the nominees get on the bench and they do what they want
9115312 living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant no matter how friendly and even tempered the beast one is affected by every twitch and grunt
9115313 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families we would not be showing contempt for the constitution wed be protecting the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
9115314 a president who ends the global scourge of aids in our time
9115315 the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
9115316 but surely we can agree that our gay brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
9115317 orangina is a drink which is mainly aimed at children and young people
9115318 the almost sinister portrayal of animals in an animation style filled with sexual innuendo leads to very mixed and confused messages
9115319 seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president
9115320 the question for the american people is whether they can make this odyssey that democratic delegates to the convention made seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president
9115321 ask not what your country can do for you but ask what you can do for your country
9115322 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because janet reno is her father
9115323 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 per cent of the time
9115324 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9115325 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9115326 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9115327 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own
9115328 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
9115329 thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
9115330 i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9115331 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
9115332 the experience lincolns supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9115333 he was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land he insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
9115334 tonight we witness in part what has become of his dream the acceptance of a democratic presidential nominee decided not by the colour of his skin but by the content of his character
9115335 he has to bring the smoke he has to bring the rain
9115336 attack thats the vps role make the case for the presidential candidate make the case against the other guy
9115337 the advantage of the role of the vice president is he doesnt have to worry about subtlety
9115338 we remember that he voted against the creation of medicare against the creation of medicaid against the clean air act against head start against the peace corps in the 60s and americorps in the 90s he even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon
9115339 if hes the most optimistic man in america id hate to see the pessimists
9115340 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
9115341 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
9115342 to put conservative values and conservative ideas into the thick of the fight for justice and opportunity
9115343 they had their chance they have not led we will
9115344 on occasion he rambled through excessive repetition bush is most effective in personal contact not a set speech
9115345 how and what we do for all of you the people who pay the taxes bear the burdens and live the american dream
9115346 cant understand how a guy like george w bush can be leading a guy with the kind of caliber experience and know how as al gore
9115347 make sure that our prosperity enriches not just the few but all working families
9115348 i believe we must challenge a culture with too much meanness and not enough meaning
9115349 when people rightly complain about higher gasoline prices we propose to give more money to the oil companies and pretend that theyre going to bring prices down
9115350 i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
9115351 the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
9115352 in a stadium like this it felt like one living organism
9115353 people are really going to see which venue looks more like america and its this one
9115354 he thoroughly and compellingly explained his plan for change with specific distinctions between what government should be responsible for and personal responsibility
9115355 we must also admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need
9115356 i cant imagine why youd have a hard time making up your mind
9115357 its important to understand how our democracy works not just looking on television but to participate is important to me
9115358 i believe we wouldnt be in iraq in his administration mcnally said
9115359 i think you get the handlers in there and you just get lost
9115360 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
9115361 weve been a band for 10 years and this is probably the coolest thing weve ever done
9115362 if god doesnt live in colorado at least thats where he spends most of his time
9115363 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9115364 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques
9115365 oh my god i cant believe were going to actually shoot this
9115366 oh malcolm i saw caligula ive seen it three times its frightfully good
9115367 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9115368 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques
9115369 oh my god i cant believe were going to actually shoot this
9115370 oh malcolm i saw caligula ive seen it three times its frightfully good
9115371 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9115372 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques
9115373 oh my god i cant believe were going to actually shoot this
9115374 oh malcolm i saw caligula ive seen it three times its frightfully good
9115375 to put the canadian people through an election before six months would have been irresponsible and in that case i would have decided in favour of the good of the canadian people and denied dissolution
9115376 sees the fundamental cause of the worlds problems in the very expansion of homo sapiens
9115377 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
9115378 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
9115379 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
9115380 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
9115381 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
9115382 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
9115383 being in like minded company with people who support the cause
9115384 it was inspiring to see the mix of black and white old and young
9115385 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
9115386 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
9115387 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
9115388 if like me you still believe america must always be a place called hope
9115389 i went on a trip to europe with my father and mother
9115390 and everywhere we went we were met by vast crowds of people hundreds of thousands of people who came out into the street because they wanted to be near to an american politician and it wasnt because his brother had been martyred three years before
9115391 our nation was the most loved nation on the face of the earth because we were regarded as an exemplary nation
9115392 it took 230 years of discipline restraint and visionary leadership by republican and democratic presidents to build up those vast reservoirs of love and adoration for the united states for the past seven years through monumental arrogance and incompetence we have drained those reservoirs dry anyone who thinks its good for our country when hezbollah is more popular in the middle east than the us has their head in an oil well
9115393 his life has been the 21st century incarnation of the american dream
9115394 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
9115395 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
9115396 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
9115397 right now the united states imports about 70 of its oil from overseas at the same time billions of dollars that we spend on all that foreign oil seems to end up in the bank accounts of those around the world who are openly hostile to american values and our way of life this costly reliance on fossil fuels threatens america and the world in other ways too co2 emissions are increasing global temperatures sea levels are rising and storms are getting worse
9115398 borrowing money from china to buy oil from saudi arabia
9115399 borrow ing money from china to buy oil from countries that dont like us
9115400 as i have said for many years throughout this land were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9115401 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth
9115402 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
9115403 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
9115404 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
9115405 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9115406 the five senators alan cranston d ca dennis deconcini d az john glenn d oh john mccain r az and donald w
9115407 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 8 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
9115408 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
9115409 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
9115410 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9115411 weve had thousands die in the first few years and mccain wants to keep it up for 100 more years
9115412 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
9115413 so long as they are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9115414 right now in the second week of may 2006 we are facing perhaps the worst gas crisis in history
9115415 we have way too much gasoline gas is down to 19 cents a gallon and the oil companies are hurting i know that i am partly to blame by insisting that cars run on trash i am therefore proposing a federal bail out to our oil companies because hey if it were the other way around you know the oil companies would help us
9115416 i think he brought it to a new level of attention and validity that we hadnt had before
9115417 al gore has been warning us of the dangers of climate change for more than twenty years
9115418 when al won an academy award for his fine documentary an inconvenient truth i was thrilled america was finally listening to the lecture hed given me every week for eight years
9115419 he had written a great book before he was chosen as vice president
9115420 its easy to take shots its part of being a public figure and being in public office you catch a lot of arrows
9115421 al gore knew more about the importance of the rain forest than the scientists
9115422 i asked him a couple of questions and he began a tutorial flying 30 000 feet over the rain forest he told us how the important the rain forest was to the environment and how it affected weather patterns i didnt know that stuff it was one of those life changing moments that ill never forget
9115423 why dont these bloody people just knock their nonsense off
9115424 as perplexed as people whod togged up for a fancy dress party and gone to the wrong address
9115425 at their age i was disdaining the opportunity of a free university education in favour of loafing and trying to scratch a living as a rock journalist theyd voyaged halfway around the world to fix a busted country
9115426 the soldiers swept their rifles back and forth up and down then gathered in a corner
9115427 this is ridiculous observed rana correctly we stopped so did the soldiers i told the one who seemed to be in charge that he was spoiling our walk youre spoiling our patrol he grinned
9115428 who arent doing smart things that they should or are doing daft things they shouldnt
9115429 point 4 the palestinians get properly organized and stop being so silly and the israelis cease acting like jerks
9115430 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
9115431 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
9115432 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
9115433 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
9115434 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
9115435 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
9115436 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
9115437 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
9115438 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
9115439 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
9115440 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
9115441 sought to transcend race and find a plane of unity
9115442 stronger than when he arrived but still with a hill to climb
9115443 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
9115444 our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome
9115445 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
9115446 we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
9115447 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families
9115448 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9115449 the experience lincolns supporters valued most was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9115450 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning
9115451 and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
9115452 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
9115453 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
9115454 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
9115455 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
9115456 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
9115457 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
9115458 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
9115459 it was very significant that sen obama directly addressed the gun violence issue in our country
9115460 i was fortunate to be in mile high stadium last night to watch and listen to sen obamas historic speech as he accepted the democratic nomination for president of the united states
9115461 it was very significant that sen obama directly addressed the gun violence issue in our country he decided to strike a balance between rights and responsibilities and showed how we can have common sense gun laws in america to protect our families and communities
9115462 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than they are for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping out of the hands of criminals
9115463 since the supreme court issued its opinion on the meaning of the second amendment the debate over gun laws in america has moved to the middle ground now common sense gun laws that save lives and protect police can be debated on their merits
9115464 america wants sensible restrictions on the easy access to dangerous weapons and sen obama clearly recognized that last night
9115465 we must seize this opportunity to elect united states of america
9115466 if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis
9115467 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9115468 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of mankind
9115469 when we said we were going to have an open convention we meant
9115470 pointing around to the open to the sky arena and
9115471 i have been to hundreds of other retirement parties not knowing what other people go through
9115472 i feel the same amount of anxiety going into something new that i did when i started teaching
9115473 doing this job i have not had many opportunities to spend time with my wife and i intend to do just that
9115474 there were kids in the streets riots going on and we were at war so i was not academically focused
9115475 i said here i am waiting on teachers lawyers and social workers at the nursery and i wanted to do something to give back myself
9115476 we need to reaffirm our commitment to those kids to make sure they can be as successful as they can be
9115477 if i have had any success it is because i have stood on the shoulders of outstanding individuals in the education community
9115478 and i feel the county office is going to expand its influence as we face the issue of narrowing the achievement gap
9115479 i think im ready and im really excited to be out there monday night
9115480 ive been thinking about this for a long time i just cant wait to get out there when we get out of that tunnel im going to feel all that excitement thats all ive been thinking about this whole week getting out there on monday night
9115481 i havent played in almost two years in a real game so im hungry to get out there and play and help this team win
9115482 it feels like its been a long time since i played in a game
9115483 i know they told me they wanted to make sure they didnt wear me out during training camp so they eased up on my reps
9115484 its something that bothers me once in a while but i get over it pretty quickly
9115485 but thats the way it is and well be ready to go
9115486 call it old fashion angst whatever it is but people seem to find something to blame
9115487 i really do think the election and the economy and gas prices have a lot to do with it but it comes down to the feeling of major change and the fact that the country has choices to consider
9115488 theyre still feeling good about a potential purchase but they cant just complete the transaction
9115489 thats different than a year ago when the fear of losing out on certain options was in the air
9115490 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
9115491 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
9115492 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
9115493 the next six months are going to tell the story
9115494 the most powerful country in the world to the weakest
9115495 why do they dislike intelligence in this country in leaders
9115496 i knew abe abe was a friend of mine and baracks no lincoln
9115497 senator i knew abe lincoln abe lincoln was friend of mine senator youre no abe lincoln
9115498 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
9115499 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
9115500 over time wall street firms began to trade against their clients for their own account such that now the direct investment activities of a firm like goldman sachs dwarf their activities on behalf of outside customers
9115501 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
9115502 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
9115503 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9115504 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again the last best hope for those who are called to the cause of peace
9115505 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
9115506 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9115507 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me
9115508 on november 4 we must stand up and say eight years is enough
9115509 let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
9115510 im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
9115511 i dont believe senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
9115512 why else would he define middle class as someone making under us5 million a year
9115513 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9115514 hes now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
9115515 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9115516 look bro we are reaching if not already reached peak oil peak coal and peak natural gas
9115517 its with great pride that i tell you that i have found the right partner to help me shake up washington and make it start working again for the people who are counting on us
9115518 shes exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight
9115519 to save lives protect property and public health and safety or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe
9115520 data from an air force reconnaissance aircraft indicate that gustav has again become a hurricane with maximum winds near 75 miles per hour 120 km h
9115521 preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion
9115522 early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise
9115523 the amount of fail on theforum com is reaching epic proportions
9115524 manter as expectativas da infla o em linha com os objectivos
9115525 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
9115526 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
9115527 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
9115528 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
9115529 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
9115530 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
9115531 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
9115532 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
9115533 gov crist now has an opportunity to make a lasting impact on the florida supreme court much like president bush has been able to do on the u s supreme court
9115534 hell be able to pick people who reflect his judgment and his conservative principles
9115535 theres no better way to accentuate your beliefs than with appointments to the court
9115536 this has not been a partisan court if i thought we were getting ideologues on the court id be concerned
9115537 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome
9115538 i dont think this country deserves a least worse choice
9115539 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
9115540 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
9115541 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
9115542 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
9115543 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
9115544 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
9115545 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
9115546 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
9115547 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
9115548 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
9115549 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
9115550 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
9115551 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
9115552 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
9115553 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
9115554 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
9115555 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
9115556 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
9115557 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
9115558 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
9115559 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
9115560 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
9115561 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
9115562 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
9115563 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
9115564 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
9115565 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
9115566 what if mccain goes down is she ready to lead
9115567 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
9115568 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
9115569 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
9115570 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
9115571 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
9115572 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
9115573 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
9115574 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
9115575 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
9115576 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
9115577 space based solar power as an opportunity for strategic security
9115578 the lunar infrastructure as proposed by the late gerard k oneill is well thought out
9115579 lastly i wanted to say that these figures are based on current residential demand
9115580 im not one who would attribute global warming to being man made
9115581 we have a very pro development president in president bush and yet he failed to push for opening up parts of alaska to drilling through congress and a republican controlled congress i might add
9115582 i would push for a strong military and a sound energy policy i believe that alaska can help set an example on energy policy
9115583 a changing environment will affect alaska more than any other state because of our location im not one though who would attribute it to being man made
9115584 im pro life ill do all i can to see every baby is created with a future and potential the legislature should do all it can to protect human life
9115585 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
9115586 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
9115587 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
9115588 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
9115589 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
9115590 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
9115591 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
9115592 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
9115593 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
9115594 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
9115595 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
9115596 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
9115597 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
9115598 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
9115599 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
9115600 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
9115601 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
9115602 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
9115603 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job

9115624 three days ago i called my mother back in tibet

9115631 we saw how law enforcement officials in london were able to track the suspects using their surveillance system during the july 2005 terrorist attack
9115632 it will be critical because now our police officers who have data mobile units in their cars will be able to tap into the camera network and have a sense of what is going on before they get to a crime scene

9115803 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9115804 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9115805 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9115806 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

9115815 its an honour for me but i think it will bring out the best in me and ill just try to lead from the front
9115816 it puts a little bit more pressure on you which is good
9115817 free running is unlikely to be at the olympics that is based on too rigid a state of mind
9115818 there will be no judges dressed in suits its the free runners who will judge themselves
9115819 when i saw those guys jumping off roofs i knew it was what i wanted to do
9115820 everybody can do it all you need is a good pair of shoes and an open mind
9115821 i think republicans are more accustomed to following the rules
9115822 were used to sitting in the cheap seats weve got binoculars
9115823 select from mymodel where rand gt rand order by rand limit 1
9115824 its always been movements of people who mobilize and put pressure on politicians and demand the changes that they want to see and then the politicians finally come around
9115825 so i think what that shows is that it is all the more necessary for people to mobilize in protest not just to wait for the next election not just to put all their hope in the next candidate
9115826 what id like to see is for people to connect those issues and think about how things would be so different if the billions that are being put into that war in iraq were being invested into the infrastructure and social programs that could be thriving in this country if we werent involved in iraq
9115827 theres no getting around it we can have a certain amount of campaign finance reform but as long as we have a huge discrepancy in wealth in this country theres gonna be a huge discrepancy in power also and we have to do what we can without a whole lot of money without political power to mitigate the effects because those that have wealth want more wealth
9115828 the biggest thing will be a building of our movement to we go on from here because we accomplish no concrete goals in four days
9115829 the building of unity is a very important part of that
9115830 today its very difficult for people for individuals to feel like they can make a change and that any protest they engage in is actually going to have an effect
9115831 a lot of it is is anybody out there listening does anybody care that were protesting
9115832 they have bought the notion that protesters are marginal and that they dont reflect the mainstream i think its also often seen as old news weve seen that weve been there weve done that the medias looking for something newer more original more unique and quite frankly unless the media thinks that protest is gonna sell and attract audiences theres not a strong motivation to cover it
9115833 they dont want to use up that strategy too often because we know that theres a fatigue you know that too much protest the medias going to become disinterested audiences are going to become disinterested so you have to try to pick the right moment and the right issues and the right image to project out there
9115834 theres something about the physical emotional connection that makes people feel committed and engaged
9115835 and i wonder the extent to which the internet makes that possible
9115836 were in a different era in which police dont just automatically see demonstrators as the enemy
9115837 that certainly was the case and we also dont have a local government that is so sort of angry with protesters and so deeply politicized about the protesters that they want to teach them a lesson
9115838 until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that that vp slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up here
9115839 see what a cute smart ass i am diddling with hillary supporters and sticking my tongue out at barack obama
9115840 there is no doubt that mccain again is making a strategic choice to appeal to a particular demographic fundamentalist right wing gun owning christians
9115841 what will you do if you get nominated for vice president
9115842 did not turn out to be a team player on budgeting issues
9115843 in an interview with two weeks ago alaska gov sarah palin r said she had met presumptive gop presidential nominee sen john mccain only once or twice

9115865 today is the judgment day it is the peoples revolution and we must win
9115866 an industry has grown up around adoption in which profit rather than the best interests of the child takes the centre stage
9115867 appropriate legal safeguards and a functioning alternative care to parental care can prevent abuse and allow intercountry adoption to continue for those who need it
9115868 the existing rules are not comprehensive enough and we must create necessary legal and other infrastructure before accepting new requests
9115869 parents were led to believe that the child will return to them but this is not the case
9115870 the art of living does not consist in preserving and clinging to a particular mode of happiness but in allowing happiness to change its form without being disappointed by the change happiness like a child must be allowed to grow up
9115871 nunca la he conocido parece ser alguien fascinante con una historia personal extraordinaria
9115872 estoy seguro de que defender a los republicanos pero desgraciadamente las cosas siguen igual y a fin de cuentas es john mccain quien encabeza la f rmula

9115885 tuvimos un paro y una movilizaci n importante muchos docentes se dieron cita en la plaza a pesar de las persecuciones oficiales de las ltimas 36 horas

9115895 from what weve seen at the scene the amount of damage done to the vehicle and also what witnesses have told us it appears that the vehicle was travelling too fast
9115896 the impact was severe the vehicle is a complete wreck
9115897 its a huge tragedy not only for their families but their friends loved ones extended families and the community
9115898 it just sends a message to all drivers to drive within the speed limit to drive carefully and drive to the conditions of the road

9115939 nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a mans character give him power
9115940 the main difficulty did not relate to finding the correlations that occur most frequently since they are readily identifiable but rather to finding the weak signals this specific need prompted us to turn to lexiquest mine which is the best tool for quickly identifying weak signals that is still what gives it its major added value
9115941 integrating lexiquest mine into the strateasy platform was easy and straightforward thanks in particular to its apis but also to technological choices which are consistent with ours
9115942 i want to believe this is a game changer but when i close my eyes i see new orleans in 1988

9115946 it tastes very much like ground beef but its a very mild very lean meat
9115947 you can put it in a can and use it to make stew with some vegetables and potatoes its wonderful
9115948 its interchangeable with ground beef but we rarely eat that because we get a lot of wild game here
9115949 if you get an old big one they are tougher but the younger smaller ones give us 300 to 400 pounds of meat and we share it with our family
9115950 por una parte veo que puede hacerse pero por otra no
9115951 es una cuesti n de esperar el s o el no de ellos no se puede hacer otra cosa

9115990 saya nak jumpa kawan saya la kami tak pernah berjumpa lagi ini 1
9115991 tengku izwan zakri dan izwan zakri adalah orang yang sama
9115992 its an employers market right when it comes to salaries
9115993 there is a lot of discussion to make sure that we know exactly where they are going
9115994 we have down sized the air force to 41 000 people and that has made us as lean i believe as we should be our capability is a combination of people equipment and the ability to train and getting the balance right is really important
9115995 we have well over 500 aeroplanes operating across the entire region of south west asia and the middle east
9115996 on the ground we have hundreds of thousands of coalition troops as well as iraqi forces and afghan forces there are so many moving parts that everything changes constantly
9115997 we were relieved finding it meant it wasnt going to blow us up
9115998 i think what you see is on operations is that people are really buoyed up with what they are doing because they are doing what they were trained to do
9115999 but when you are back at home we have gone through significant change for example the reduction in man power and that unsettles people
9116000 we are doing a huge amount to make sure when people come home we make their life at home as easy as possible given the operational pressure that we are under
9116001 we could always do with more resources because we could do things more quickly and we could be more robust
9116002 its like they just stapled a cheerleader to mccains head to try and make him prettier
9116003 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
9116004 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
9116005 we are looking for candidates who possess the following skills and experience strong phone sales experience mostly
9116006 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
9116007 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
9116008 we were extremely tired after a very very solid emotional gut busting month
9116009 i dont believe our players have been this flat for a number of weeks
9116010 we wanted to take fourth spot but it didnt materialise because we were unaccustomed to being second our forwards being behind players not close enough to support each other
9116011 under those circumstances i have no doubt there is a psychological let down after big games particularly if you have a lot of young players
9116012 if you have a seasoned team thats regularly in the finals and im not talking about the club cause its our third year in a row but its the team out there and a lot of these players simply havent been in finals football and i have no doubt that some of them subconsciously think the last thing i want to do is be injured
9116013 so its going to be cut throat one loss and youre out one win and you get another chance but i believe we can rebound from this
9116014 my name is mister frank n odesis i have an offer to make to you i guarantee delivery of 750 000 00 cash if you push this button
9116015 good of you to ask its nothing really when you push the button a person you have never met will die
9116016 you should at least sleep on it its a big decision 750 000 00 in the hands of one prone to sin will usually make the problem worse
9116017 i agree ill think about it overnight thanks mister whatever your name was
9116018 so thats all there is to it what are you going to do with the button now
9116019 very well im going to give the button to someone who has never met you spend the money quickly
9116020 that was our expectation so anything short of that from our end is not what we wanted to be
9116021 i like this team though i really do i think in the next few years were going to be a playoff team theres too many good guys here
9116022 the answers are right out there for why offensively we havent succeeded
9116023 but like i said i think in the last two three weeks ive seen more signs of us being what i thought we were going to be
9116024 i think in the early years when i first joined the blue jays organization it was lack of payroll that kept us back
9116025 i think when you compete against the yankees and the red sox its the one thing you have to consider
9116026 youre going to get the odd aberration but it doesnt happen too often just take a look at who gets into the playoffs every year the top spending teams
9116027 now that weve reached 100 million we should be starting to produce
9116028 our minor league system should be kicking in i would think in the next few years were on the cusp of being a world series contender
9116029 part of an evaluation process is to look at the team and say is this a group that oh my god theyre never going to get better
9116030 or is this a group that you can feel comfortable going to bat with
9116031 and i think we feel comfortable going to bat with these guys some guys probably havent had the year that weve wanted them to have but that doesnt mean we dont have a lot of confidence in them
9116032 i keep looking at this club and obviously im disappointed its going to be tough for us to be a playoff club because thats your no 1 goal
9116033 but im also walking away saying theres a lot of positive things happening here

9116046 it was a good way to finish the series but the indians played well and deserved to win it
9116047 credit goes to the boys for the way we came back we kept making mistakes through the series we were not consistent in the batting department
9116048 it was good to win the series with a game to spare
9116049 these tracks are said to be slow but the bounce has improved over the last few years i am happy with the way our batsmen have played the spin it was important to keep the strike rotating and our batsmen did that well

9116067 we wanted to think about the different facets of the phenomenon from his impact on grassroots organizing to the racial components the use of technology the intersection of race and gender
9116068 the social construction of obama understanding the currency of blackness
9116069 hating hillary baiting barack racism misogyny and homophobia in campaign paraphernalia
9116070 i think theres going to be a proliferation of scholarly publications on the guy
9116071 first i think democrats are too sanguine about the long term effect of an obama win on americas standing in the world
9116072 which other presidential candidate in history could reminisce as mr obama does when describing his childhood years in indonesia about the feel of packed mud under bare feet as i wander through paddy fields
9116073 so the window of opportunity will be brief im concerned about mismatched expectations between the united states on the one hand and its allies and partners on the other many americans think as soon as president bush departs the rest of the world will be more willing to share our burdens many allies think as soon as president bush departs washington will start listening to us more
9116074 i think he really will have an impact on what goes on in the classroom
9116075 hes the first african american candidate and that obviously is going to get him a lot of attention scholarly and otherwise
9116076 i definitely think it will trickle down into the classroom
9116077 its all the students want to talk about and it really is a new chapter in the textbooks
9116078 the assumption is that its going to be like part of the campaign all positive but thats not true were by nature critical
9116079 it will be a snapshot and it will be fascinating to see how we capture and fail to capture what is or is not going on with regard to our countrys narrative of race
9116080 examining our post racial selves obama as a balm for what ails us
9116081 much of the buzz both positive and negative surrounding obama indicates that america remains bogged down by many historically based sociocultural notions of race
9116082 society likes to fit people into discrete boxes and obama defies and resists this tendency towards stereotypical essentialization he is both black and white and of america yet global in his appeal
9116083 he is progressive on some issues moderate on others and he has been able to be a crossover success in an american political landscape often said to be uneasy with those with foreign sounding names from urban centres he has already accomplished what many would have reasonably prophesied as unattainable in this socio political terrain
9116084 what will obamas candidacy do for the multiracial movement in the united states
9116085 does the success of particular individuals say anything or much about the possibilities for other members of that persons group
9116086 if he wins his candidacy and victory is likely to be included in u s history and government textbooks
9116087 if he loses he is likely to be included but more as a footnote and probably in a section dealing with african american history

9116150 o you who believe fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness
9116151 we gave the good things of this life to these men and their fathers until the period grew long for them see they not that we gradually reduce the land in their control from its outlying borders is it then they who will win

9116175 after 9 11 nobody wanted to hear anything bad about america
9116176 nobody loves a war better than the president and a few years ago it got to the point where if i said anything i truly believed about the iraq war or global warming during a concert people would get up and leave thats fine with me actually its a badge of honour
9116177 little by little it became clear that bush was bizarre and dangerous
9116178 i would do concerts where i would see people in the audience sitting with their arms crossed looking angry as i said i was right 40 years ago and i am right now and throw my fist in the air now theyre listening bushs great trick is to suggest that to go against him is to be unpatriotic slowly people realised that
9116179 i represent so much before ive even opened my mouth but i was more active when i was young and its only now that im spending time with my family

9116181 the vietnamese developed all sorts of neuroses and phobias after the war ended because they were no longer spending every day in the heightened state that comes with not knowing if youre going to be killed or not when the war ended a lot of us lost direction i certainly did
9116182 i had this great fear of going commercial as a result of becoming well known at such a young age i was afraid of the wider world but i did also have deeply held beliefs that i clung on to tenaciously the big event was meeting martin luther king in 1956 at a quaker seminar that pretty much shaped the direction my life took
9116183 at times of great uncertainty music and politics are fused
9116184 i would never have sung we shall overcome to an american audience during the eighties because it would have been a nostalgia trip now its appropriate again because its relevant im happiest when that happens

9116211 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary rodham clinton left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9116212 but it turns out that the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9116213 theres a lot of women who probably look at the democratic ticket and say why couldnt you pick a woman
9116214 theres a broader body of women 35 to 55 that obama has had problems with and she gives mccain more of a chance with those women
9116215 mrs clinton got a lot of women in places like kentucky and west virginia to vote for her in some of the later primaries ms palin is going to help give him a shot with some of those
9116216 how can you go wrong with a mooseburger eating ice fishing governor
9116217 mccain is the candidate and he has the record that steelworkers will be voting against
9116218 john mccain just does not get what ordinary people here in beaver pennsylvania are going through heres a guy that said weve made great economic progress under george w bush i dont think youve seen that progress here in beaver
9116219 as president im going to end this war in iraq
9116220 i am going to go after those who actually killed 3 000 americans in afghanistan in the hills between afghanistan and pakistan we need a president who is going to go after al qaida and not just talk tough
9116221 you know we cant keep on seeing our jobs shipped overseas
9116222 they want to show he can play in smaller venues too that he can connect with people in smaller settings
9116223 if i were them id try to stop by a game on the way out thats what im going to do
9116224 i realize that most people on friday nights are sitting and watching a football game i applaud you for being here i thank you for coming
9116225 high school football in western pennsylvania im sure barack and joe biden have no idea what its like
9116226 its part of i think the revitalization of this section of pennsylvania and could be duplicated all across the country
9116227 a double hit this creates jobs in my state it creates jobs in this state
9116228 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9116229 campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9116230 im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same
9116231 so ultimately john mccains at the top of the ticket i think he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming gov palin agrees with him and his policies
9116232 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
9116233 hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan and they will be left in the city not out of choice but out of necessity
9116234 my thing is my fright is if we have somebody in these houses and theyre not able to get out theyre going to perish
9116235 if i was the governor of louisiana id give the evacuation order as soon as possible
9116236 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9116237 should really make the app start to shine a bit more
9116238 we dont have mod support at launch we want to but we have our hands so full with getting the game out and getting tools out there that work well for people and with the game is a pretty big undertaking
9116239 i used to send a taxicab to the almanac hotel the day he was gonna pitch i didnt want him to get lost on the way to the stadium
9116240 it affects so many aspects of your life its going to affect possibly if you get a job if you can rent a home or buy a home when you try to buy a car theyre going to get a credit report
9116241 so keep your balance at pretty much fifty percent of your credit limit because if you are always at the max then theyre going to assume that youre being stretched and you may not be able to pay all your bills
9116242 youre going to be paying that debt for years and its going to look like that debts going to be there for a long time and if you only pay the minimum its going to appear to lenders that youre struggling and you cant even make more than the minimum payment
9116243 so those three steps i think will help you get out of bad credit but you have to remember that its not going to happen overnight you just have to be diligent keep a budget and keep your spending to a minimum
9116244 i didnt go to the hospital i didnt ask i didnt know any better
9116245 when i actually got tired of getting sick i grabbed the meter one day and i started walking around the plant trying to see where this odor is coming from
9116246 the meter only goes up to thousand ppm parts per million so it pegged out in 10 seconds thousand ppm but on the same reading it has an explosive gas reading that one pegged out in five seconds
9116247 i was about 25 feet away when i could actually smell it i just glad i didnt go over there and bend over and looked at the reading i might have just dropped

9116255 one of the most anti environment records of any governor in the united states
9116256 she has supported oil drilling in some of the most ecologically sensitive areas in alaska even when it meant sacrificing polar bears beluga whales and the arctic national wildlife refuge
9116257 despite her advocacy for expanded oil and gas drilling palin has done almost nothing to promote the clean energy sources that can help solve global warming which is already having major negative consequences in her state
9116258 a changing environment will affect alaska more than any other state because of our location

9116265 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
9116266 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
9116267 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child

9116269 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added

9116274 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives

9116286 in at amp t 3g umts power control is key to the mobile and network success if the ue phone set requires too much downlink power then the base station or node b can run out of transmitter power and this is what was happening as you get more ues on the cell the noise floor rises and the cell has to compensate by ramping up its power to the ues
9116287 the power control issue will also have an effect on the data throughput
9116288 because the higher the data rate the more power the node b transmitter requires to transmit if the ues have poor power control and are taking more power than is necessary then it will sap the networks ability to deliver high speed data
9116289 in a mixed environment where users are running 2 0 2 0 1 and 2 0 2 the power control problems of 2 0 and 2 0 1 will affect the 2 0 2 users

9116298 its tough to turn to obama and say youre too inexperienced when youre a 72 year old presidential candidate who has chosen a 44 year old with even less government experience to be next in line
9116299 ive spent the last few months looking for a running mate who can best help me shake up washington and make it start working again for the people that are counting on us
9116300 and its with great pride and gratitude that i tell you i have found the right partner
9116301 i predict any conservatives who have been lukewarm thus far in their support of the mccain candidacy will work their hearts out
9116302 she builds an audience for a convention that might otherwise have been ignored
9116303 now people will tune in to get to know her shes obviously fascinating shes quirky
9116304 in her first year and a half she has governed fairly pragmatically and from the middle
9116305 the question thats obviously on everyones mind is is her thin resume going to blow things up and essentially make the pick a disaster
9116306 an encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9116307 a former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9116308 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9116309 its not an accident that theyve had quite a bit of success
9116310 i have seen a little but but not too much yet
9116311 they run pretty basic stuff they blitz a lot bringing linebackers stuff like that
9116312 small schools come out like theyve got something to prove they always have
9116313 they have nothing to lose if they come play a big school all the big schools kind of have a bulls eye on their back they just come up and give it all they got
9116314 and our chances are even worse than david against goliath we dont have enough smooth stones up here
9116315 theyve won big games before they beat a good navy team last year we know what were in for
9116316 its unbelievable theres so much parity in college football today

9116319 it helps us out hopefully it will work out on saturday
9116320 a running mate who can best help me shake up washington and make it work again
9116321 understands the problems the hopes the values of working people
9116322 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9116323 zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9116324 she leads a state that matters to every one of us alaska has significant energy resources and she has been a leader in the fight to make america energy independent
9116325 a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9116326 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9116327 an outstanding pick from the choices that were on the table
9116328 governor sarah palin is an outspoken advocate for pro family policies that energize social conservatives
9116329 it clearly makes it more difficult for mccain to criticize obamas experience
9116330 in addition you would have to make similar changes in every location that would reference the original rd1 directory to include home sitename5 fantasticodata smf in order for the update in fantastico to be successful
9116331 and i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9116332 weve got our work cut out this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly

9116385 the spotlight is on china to reduce particulate pollution hence it will not be possible for china to revert to polluting plants going back on stream steadily
9116386 so to start production it will take another month or so we feel that only by say january 2009 would the production start in proper scale

9116391 our study shows that preterm infants make incomplete and or delayed recovery from interruptions in breathing
9116392 inability or delayed recovery from repeated low oxygen episodes can also be detrimental to brain development
9116393 there is increasing evidence that infants exposed to prenatal cigarette smoke are at high risk for developmental and behavioral disorders
9116394 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
9116395 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
9116396 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
9116397 this may have stifled efforts at developing newer and better vaccines especially for use in the elderly
9116398 improving quality of care are better directed at where the evidence is such as hand washing vaccinating children and vaccinating health care workers

9116403 the fact that radiation exposure is associated with thyroid cancer is well known and not news

9116436 our performance at dundee was really pleasing but its early days in the league i know we have good players but im surprised how well we have done so far
9116437 the partick thistle tradition is we get 3500 fans on saturday everyone expects us to win easily and we end up losing
9116438 we cant let that happen but so far weve been knocking the ball about well defending pretty solidly and looking a real threat
9116439 we played really well against clyde and should have killed the game off but ended up with just a draw
9116440 the offer was there and it was something my wife and i had to consider
9116441 the upshot was we decided not to do it at this time of my career
9116442 a few options came up and when i spoke to the livingston manager and chairman hearing about the vision they had it was the right move
9116443 its a case of so far so good and i think the fans deserve to have a team that is at the very least challenging for the spl arguably they should be in the spl when you look at their set up
9116444 we are on a good wee run we are winning games we would maybe have lost in years gone by which is testimony to our players resolve the boys here have all bought into the philosophy of the manager and his team its a refreshing attitude to how we approach our games and training and it seems to be working
9116445 jim is a very motivated coach hes young and has his players working for him extremely well
9116446 i think you could always tell he would be a good coach he has a great passion for football and its showing in his players
9116447 you have to give him credit because he has turned that team around from the time when stephen kenny was involved
9116448 jim has always been a very hard player to play against he is a very clever player in many ways and has taken that intelligence into the coaching side from what i hear the dunfermline players are buying into his philosophy just as we are with our boss at livingston
9116449 its going to be very difficult i think livingston have won their last six games so they will be very confident and strong
9116450 they have good experience at the back and in the middle of the park we will have to be at our best to beat them and its a game we want to win although i expect it to be tight
9116451 i think the industry is smarter but its hard to say if its better prepared
9116452 if you think about an old car and you repair it its hard to make it better than new but you can make it close to new the question is is new good enough

9116456 arthur is very special to me hes a very strong kid hes a good leader and a good person
9116457 its like having another coach who can give you in depth one on one attention
9116458 he has a great mind for football which is why he was such a great coach he can remember every individual play from each game but more importantly he is like a father if i could turn out to be like anyone i would want it to be like him
9116459 my sisters and i strive to be like my mom
9116460 if i could be half the person my mother is i will be fine
9116461 i would have been completely happy going to boston college and enjoying a great career but i also felt i had to take my official visits before i decided
9116462 as soon as i got to georgia i didnt need to take anymore visits i knew it was a perfect fit for me academically and socially i met the players and they are all down to earth guys i felt extremely comfortable with the players and the coaching staff
9116463 it would be a dream come true and if the opportunity arose i would run with it but if it doesnt happen then it doesnt if i end up teaching and coaching that would be just as fulfilling as a career in the nfl
9116464 even though the track has been pretty consistent you just dont know
9116465 im not sure thats a huge worry or a signal that somethings changing in the market
9116466 we usually do see a bump right before a holiday weekend
9116467 the formation of gustav has really put a stop to the drop in crude oil
9116468 if we didnt have this storm we could be talking about crude oil dropping below 110
9116469 we dont like to say its routine but weve been through it many times
9116470 we generally pay the lowest we pay for gas all year in the next few months so barring a hurricane drivers can probably look forward to that
9116471 but remember the trend of the last few years is prices never go down as far as they went up
9116472 i think i was just seeing it better there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up it was just one of those days when i made about a 15 footer on the first hole and another one on the second hole and then i had an 8 footer on the third hole and it looked easy
9116473 right now i feel really good thats all i can say
9116474 i feel good with my swing im hitting the ball good im healthy im strong and ill tell you what i feel a lot better right now on the greens than i did then so that should tell you something
9116475 its just the kind of round you wish you could play every day
9116476 i hit it well and made some putts and i probably would have been happy with 2 putts on 18 but it snuck in and just made an already good round better
9116477 im coming off a victory last week obviously the swing feels a lot better you know just in a flow
9116478 i have a great attitude on the greens right now the greens are much softer this year than ive ever seen on the first day so thats why the scoring you can almost attack the pins
9116479 the golf course is in great shape but the greens are soft
9116480 they were much firmer thursday in the pro am then they were yesterday so they must have softened it up a little bit the conditions are great theres no wind and the pins are very fair
9116481 if youre going in with a short iron and the pin is very accessible you can actually go ahead and hit it the iron shot feels a lot easier beside one or two pins the rest of them are very generous thats why youve got a lot of guys shooting low numbers
9116482 when you have confidence on the green obviously the iron shot feels a lot easier too i just dont feel any pressure out there at the moment with my game or my swing im very comfortable so thats pretty much why im more free to hit it
9116483 its painful but it doesnt hurt when i hit the ball its only slightly painful on the takeaway its getting better
9116484 two weeks off youd rather get it over and done with
9116485 but ill be watching a little ryder cup and practicing a little bit just keeping my swing in tune
9116486 it just keeps you in a good rhythm all the time
9116487 its fun playing golf here in the new england area the course is terrific even though i didnt play well its still a fun day
9116488 we get off early 8 22 a m and the greens are smooth maybe ill get a few more putts to roll in that will be my opportunity to go low
9116489 there are some holes out here you can take advantage of the fairways are running out so were having shorter irons in
9116490 its fun to have this it gets old every single week getting beat up with the rough up to your knees and youre just hacking it out and ridiculously fast firm greens its fun to have a week like this where the scores are low
9116491 if i had played the last couple holes the way i should have it would have saved me 2 shots and i thought 4 under would have been a decent round not that far back
9116492 the course could have been had youve got to shoot low out here two under wasnt great i fought hard i thought if i could finish strong id be right in it but i let a couple of shots go in the end
9116493 i love it i think its a great track the best tpc we have in my opinion its a fun course to play this week is perfect
9116494 you just have to play good over four rounds a lot can happen over the next three rounds
9116495 i imagine this afternoon its going to get a little rowdy
9116496 my goal here was just to make the cut because ive had great success here in the past
9116497 i figured if i made the cut it would be a win for me
9116498 hopefully the new baby will hold on after seeing 1 year old lilly born i would never miss that
9116499 i feel good this week and im happy with my game im playing well and confident
9116500 i didnt hit the ball as well as ive been hitting it lately but i managed to score well and thats the important thing
9116501 hopefully i can get it sorted out if this is my worst ball striking round then well be in good shape
9116502 and that made no sense to me at all after pondering over what he could have b meant b to write i went ahead and clicked the link now you have the gospel truth
9116503 with the addition of a marketplace the android ecosystem is becoming even more robust
9116504 i am incredibly energized by the support and amazing content ive seen so far
9116505 we already had a messaging service that can work over text messages so when we started developing a mobile app we wanted to take a huge step up from that
9116506 android is the only platform where every phone will have gps an accelerometer and where the application can run in the background
9116507 what developers want is to code for a few platforms and reach a large audience people have been developing for the iphone because of coolness factor but also because the iphone 3g has huge distribution around the world
9116508 it will come down to how fast android can build market share and create a compelling market
9116509 the company spends about 6 billion a year on programming to give our customers the best content and the most video choices
9116510 while we have been aggressive at controlling costs we expect continued increases in programming particularly in sports
9116511 theyre raising rates on individual service to push people to bundles because that means they get more money but the reality is now consumers have fewer and fewer choices
9116512 basically there are a bunch of people that are coming from twitter over to blip fm
9116513 weve allowed users to integrate their blip account with twitter friendfeed pownce jaiku and tumblr accounts in other words when you blip on blip fm it will also appear as a tweet on twitter
9116514 my favorite description is that if twitter and last fm had a love child it would be blip fm its funny how things come out in web 2 0 parlance
9116515 cpuc staff is looking into allegations concerning t mobile cell siting

9116524 well take our voices with our hands well make like knives well make demands im burning bridges for the last time im breaking habits for the first time i saw my future today it said im going away and i still havent sung the last line on my way down im not ready to lay im not ready to fade im not ready to die
9116525 hyperbole an extravagant statement or figure of speech not intended to be taken literally as to wait an eternity
9116526 we obviously didnt finish the season the way we wanted to last year this is another opportunity another year to erase those negative thoughts
9116527 he said it the first day its going to be a little bit of a circus with a lot going on
9116528 ive been pleasantly surprised with how well it has gone for the most part everybody knows what we have going the perception of who we are were eager to get out on the field
9116529 peoples perceptions they roll with that stuff over and over and you just have to try and keep a level head about it all
9116530 but for us we dont add to it we dont all talk about whatever happened in
9116531 everybody has done a great job as far as interacting when they need to with the cameras but at the same time when its time to focus on football then were playing football
9116532 we handled things well when we had a lot of odd games and dallas cowboys type games last year
9116533 they handled that well and going into it last year we had a lot of high expectations maybe not from everybody but from us were going through the same thing
9116534 wade wants you go be who you are wants your personality to show
9116535 but the teams got to be first and i think everybodys bought into that weve got something to prove
9116536 the most impressive thing for me is being able to put last year behind us and move forward because none of that matters now
9116537 it was like i never pitched before im disgusted with my outing
9116538 we just didnt know how much better eighty two wins is a big moment and i want this to be the standard of what we do to get that number on an annual basis
9116539 youve got to break through the barrier eventually weve done it now lets move on down the road
9116540 theyre on a roll right now theyre playing very well at home
9116541 its quiet i like my neighbors people are very nice and my kids can get a good education
9116542 if you dont have education people go in a bad way
9116543 this is what i want in southern sudan for everyone to go to school
9116544 i want to continue doing that to build both maybe build more school s and more clinic s i want to help my people out
9116545 some people dont have food to eat clean water to drink no place to stay
9116546 but when we asked them what we could do for them they all said build us a school
9116547 the only bad people are in the government we must work together we cannot let what is happening in darfur happen again in the south education and working together is the only way
9116548 byu byu where the girls are girls and the boys are too

9116557 si es real lo que vi en la prensa de que en rep blica dominicana el 80 por ciento de la energ a el ctrica depende del petr leo mientras en china s lo depende un 20 entonces hay que concluir en que tenemos un gran problema de la generaci n de la energ a el ctrica que apunta a agravarse en vez de mejorarse

9116560 its really nice having a place to go out and not be looked at as being different than anybody else
9116561 ninety percent of the guys out here are wounded veterans from world war ii all the way up to now we all deal with similar limitations and just get out there and have fun
9116562 i prayed for death pretty much every day after i got out i felt pretty much useless
9116563 it can be hard it all depends on the person all depends on where they are in the continuum of healing
9116564 some youll find that if they were really good at something before an injury occurs its really hard for them to try it if theyre not as good as they were before some are ready right away after an injury
9116565 after my injuries and the severity of what its like to be in iraq and the day to day business of being over there this is someplace we can come and play golf thats relaxing
9116566 i was always a little bit amazed that the only people that could play the course were those that could walk it they had no carts none of that stuff
9116567 its easier to get 8 000 or 10 000 worth of work donated than a check of 2 000
9116568 there is a difference between having a cookie bake sale and the type of money well need to build it
9116569 i need a little bit bigger donations than the cookie sale
9116570 what do i need to rub to get one of those
9116571 uh the kids rarely tell me how ridiculously grateful they are for all that i do
9116572 i mean when other people see the kids and how they act that gives you your recognition
9116573 are you talking about the kids who are now riding a piano dolly down the street
9116574 everybody is sick in their world everybody is an unhappy unwed single mother whose feet are exploding
9116575 im actually putting a little edge on my criticism just to make up for the fact that on msnbc last night somebody said quote

9116581 obviously we had some things that kind of didnt have the attention on our team but i think we fought through those things and we came together as a team and we made some strides and thats all you can ask for
9116582 i think we all grew up a little bit during that situation i think he did a very good job of handling a challenge handling a situation that there really wasnt a script for and was unprecedented i think it is definitely something he can learn from
9116583 its been a difficult time the last few months as far as the attention ive gotten but i think im ready for it i know its going to be amped up once the season starts im going to be scrutinized but thats the job of being an nfl quarterback theres a lot of pressure on you outside the building guys expect you to play well inside the locker room im ready for anything that comes
9116584 i think it is important for him to focus on playing quarterback and i think he has done a great job of that
9116585 i think he has done everything right as far as his focus how he has handled every step of the way to get through this process i think his play has reflected that and that is ultimately what he will be judged by
9116586 i felt that before the preseason started i think hes done all the things needed to prepare himself for this opportunity
9116587 i think were going to be tough to run on tough to pass on
9116588 i think well be a top defense in the nfl
9116589 im going to play my butt off for him because i know hes genuine hes sincere hes a good person
9116590 she hasnt really had an opportunity to practice with her teammates
9116591 those three games we knew were just more getting her ready mentally for the olympics than it was for us
9116592 it was time for her to take the next step there was no more rehab to do
9116593 she was a huge factor in how we played because of her strength and size she could intimidate people on the defensive end and there were very few people who could stop her 1 on 1 in the post offensively
9116594 im not getting much sleep that jet lag is really kicking my butt right now but im going to get there and be all right im glad i had a chance to go out there and show what i have after coming off a knee injury
9116595 we expect her to slowly progressively start to fill up the stat box and everything else the way we know she can
9116596 if offensively it has to wait and defensively shes a presence then well wait for that
9116597 lisa leslie and delisha milton jones have done this in the past and i dont see it as being a big factor
9116598 in the last two years parker has played a lot of basketball ill be monitoring her more than the other two
9116599 i slept the entire ride on the plane from start to finish
9116600 i came back and was wide awake couldnt sleep at night
9116601 all of us play overseas so we know what its like to come back and practice or play right away even if youre not sleeping that much
9116602 i dont want to talk up china because then it makes it sound like greece was bad
9116603 greece wasnt bad it was amazing as well china though everything from the people the venues the way things were run there it really was first class
9116604 they werent ready with cabs other than that you really cant complain
9116605 youre talking about a city with over 17 million people in the space and size of rhode island
9116606 its a pretty high powered city in general anyway the enormity of it is probably what strikes me the people there did a great job of putting on the olympics they were great hosts
9116607 the chinese people were really gracious and kind throughout the whole tournament very helpful
9116608 the city was really prepared and made the whole thing a great experience
9116609 we like pizza false we like toys we like games with lots of noise
9116610 oh its a notebook that you take home with you from school and do the work thats in it and then bring it back the next day
9116611 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service
9116612 for when he had said sacrifice to prevent any from thinking he bade them kill themselves he forthwith added
9116613 for theirs was a material one and not very acceptable either
9116614 and in sundry other passages he clearly throws them aside
9116615 and so in another place he rejects it and says
9116616 and how is the body it may be said to become a sacrifice
9116617 and observe how great the exactness wherewith he uses each word
9116618 them as if he had said never more have any interest in them
9116619 much more must we who offer not senseless animals but ourselves exhibit more strictness and be pure in all respects that we also may be able to say as did paul
9116620 for he was purer than any sacrifice and so he speaks of himself as
9116621 but this will be brought about if we kill the old man if we mortify our members that are upon the earth if we crucify the world unto ourselves
9116622 that is one without anything that is bodily gross visible
9116623 so yesterdays third string quarterback at notre dame might be starting at central michigan or some other place
9116624 it also could be to your detriment if youre a weak looking team and theres a lot of flaws and not a lot of enthusiasm
9116625 that was his philosophy i disagreed with it but obviously the president agreed with it because thats the way it was
9116626 the good students are going to be really attracted to notre dame even today just the word notre dame carries such power now their facilities are tremendous
9116627 notre dame is still notre dame its still a special place
9116628 that doesnt mean we cant win we might not be in that game as often as somebody who doesnt face that but it doesnt mean we cant be there
9116629 what i found from being here is its the furthest thing from being the truth

9116645 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington but when you get to know her youre gonna be as impressed as i am
9116646 is a very attractive candidate in every sense of the word shes a governor and americans like to see governors in or in the case of the vp near the white house she has impeccable credentials she is articulate and forgive me ladies but theres no other word for it sarah palin is a babe who better to best baracks rock star image

9116654 las vegas accusations and denials continue to fly in a bizarre case out of las vegas where nine kittens hiding inside a brick wall near an apartment complex were sealed inside the wall by urethane spray foam
9116655 they were trying to cut away the foam which took hours because they couldnt get through it
9116656 and then i just started going crazy and sledge hammering the wall to get them out because i could hear them crying
9116657 it wasnt a case where their feet were in foam and they could run around with foam on their feet and it was really bad
9116658 it was a case of the cats were literally stuck in foam and the foam was stuck to the ground
9116659 i dont think that if we had gotten there on sunday that they wouldnt have been able to survive another day
9116660 i dont know how long a five week old kitten would have been able to live without food water or going to the bathroom because the vet actually had to remove foam from there because it was all foamed up
9116661 i know he did it on purpose i know for a fact that hes been complaining about those cats forever to me and he was saying he was going to put down a pesticide broken glass rat traps etc hes been talking about it forever and he finally did it
9116662 i want you to understand that this incident was in no way intentional this accusation has entirely turned my life upside down in a matter of days and thanks to the lack of hearing my side of the story everyone pictures me as this monster like cat hating type of guy and its unbearable again i am truly deeply sorry this happened to those poor kittens
9116663 due to the companys lack of willingness to spend the amount necessary to properly and efficiently fix the wall this was my way of doing this without spending large amounts of money
9116664 what its like to be doesnt squeal with delight at each and every god forsaken onesie rattle or pair of booties
9116665 probably like you i have spent a lot of time in bars educating the common people found there that central bankers and most economists of the world are a corrupt moronic and treacherous clot of intellectual traitors who dont know squat about economics and instead believe strange new equation based theories that have names like general dynamic integrated analytical equilibrium monetary whiz bang do wah diddy theory that is all predicated on laughable yet inviolable imperatives like for instance if you lower interest rates borrowing will automatically increase which is followed by the even more preposterous if borrowing increases gdp will automatically increase which is all so ludicrous that it makes you laugh until you realize that this describes the economic system of the united states whereupon you puke your guts out in fear and you scream crying like a little baby the mogambo was right

9116667 central planning is sold to a hopeful people as a way to solve societal problems to right wrongs and bring about perfect justice and equality central planning promises you everything you are entitled to as a bonus goods and services produced by others are added to the list of commodities that everyone has a right to suddenly everyone is entitled to healthcare housing education food et cetera it might sound nice that the state will magically provide all these wonderful things but these rosy promises mask a dehumanizing ugly reality the other side of these entitlements is that now the doctor the builder the teacher the farmer are slaves to the all powerful state no longer do they serve patients students or customers they work in complete obedience to the state their only customer
9116668 it is not difficult to understand if we think of how a criminal with a counterfeiting machine might behave would we see fiscal restraint of course not if a person could create all the money he needs or wants with a printing press we would expect unlimited profligacy this is precisely what the federal reserve does it not only acts as the guarantor of the liquidity of the banking system but also functions as the guarantor of the entire government financial system
9116669 given this it is hardly surprising that there seems to be a strange disconnect between tax policy and spending policy the politician isnt concerned about it any more than the counterfeiter worries about the bills coming and going they know that the money is going to be there if they need it this is not only bad policy in general but it introduces an occasion of sin for the political class it is too much to ask of anyone to be financially disciplined if he has the capacity to create out of thin air all the money he wants

9116711 new psoriasis can form at the site of an injury for some people this process called koebnerization also occurs on the scalp digging the scalp with a sharp toothed comb or even incessant scratching can break the skin the result injury and new psoriasis
9116712 there is another reason to be careful in removing scales if scales are not softened and are simply scraped away without much preparation hair can come with it
9116713 if i am not rich and successful now how can i lie to myself and imagine that i am already rich and successful
9116714 the system supposedly draws toxins out through the soles of the feet and the water changes color due to the release of toxic substances through the 2 000 pores of the soles of the feet the water will change color and consistency from orange brown to black yellow is said to come from the kidneys and bladder orange brown from the joints green dark brown to black from the liver gallbladder and or bowel and white from the lymphatic system
9116715 even if they could this would not remove toxins from the body real detoxification takes place in the liver which modifies the chemical structure of undesirable substances the modified substances then circulate through the bloodstream to the kidneys which filter them into the urine the skin has no involvement in this process and is not an organ of detoxification sweat which contains water and salt helps maintain body temperature but does not play a significant role in toxin removal
9116716 the only thing that can stop falling hair is the floor
9116717 disturbing as these reports may be many of the hazards associated with computer use can be prevented
9116718 by learning the most common causes of computer distress and making some basic changes to their work place and work habits most people can avoid joining the growing ranks of casualties of the computer revolution
9116719 psoriasis seems to involve a strong hereditary factor although only one third of its victims can recall having a relative with the disease
9116720 occasionally psoriasis will begin as a group of little pimples instead of scaly patches this is especially common when the onset is triggered by a sore throat or a similar streptococcal infection
9116721 the columbia university college of physicians and surgeons complete home medical guide
9116722 in severe cases the patches may spread and run together or the body may be vertically covered with a red bumpy rash
9116723 when you swim your head because it is in the water is exposed to 100 percent humidity so there is no drying no evaporation no cooling and therefore no spasm of the airways however the shock of diving into very cold water can also induce asthma so it may be wiser to enter the pool toe by toe
9116724 one of my sons is an asthmatic he was always athletically inclined and anxious to keep physically fit most sports provoked asthma made him wheeze and left him short of breath but he could swim virtual ly endlessly without any trouble whatsoever so thats what he focused on became a superb swimmer and ended up on his college swimming team
9116725 if you do not have access to a pool or dont happen to enjoy swimming what are your alternatives
9116726 but a great deal depends on how long you actually work out under what circum stances as well as the temperature and the humidity of the environment it usually takes anywhere up to twelve minutes of continuous as opposed to intermittent exercise to preci pitate asthma in a vulnerable person the asthmatic attack itself begins a few minutes after the exertion ends and may last for an hour or more if for some reason you must participate in physical acti vity that you know will give you asthma certain medications taken beforehand may prevent it

9116729 every day in america 40 000 people miss school or work 30 000 people have an asthma attack 5 000 people visit the emergency room 1 000 people are admitted to the hospital and 11 people die due to asthma
9116730 in 2004 there were 13 6 million physician office visits and 1 million outpatient department visits due to asthma asthma accounts for one quarter of all emergency room visits in the united states each year with 2 million emergency room visits in 2001
9116731 asthma episodes are responsible for eight million school days lost each year 24 million days of restricted activity for both children and adults and 12 million bed rest days
9116732 the columbia university college of physicians and surgeons complete home medical guide
9116733 about half of all chronic sickness in childhood is due to asthma which accounts for more days lost from school than any other illness one child in every 40 has the disease boys more often than girls however asthma can and often does have its onset in or persists into adult life i have several patients who without any previous history of lung problems suddenly become asthmatic in their 70s
9116734 when an asthma attack starts the muscle layer contracts causing the narrowing of the airways as a consequence it is more difficult for air to flow in and out so that breathing becomes harder and more prolonged
9116735 the asthma patient is often sensitive to various stimuli or trigger factors around the house school or workplace tobacco smoke air pollution paint and paint thinners hair sprays perfume cleaning fluid liquid chlorine bleach spray starch dust room deodorizers and spray furniture polish he or she may be sensitive to changes in weather sudden blasts of cold air humid changes a change in seasons or walking the dog on a cold night
9116736 the columbia university college of physicians and surgeons complete home medical guide
9116737 patients may be allergic to foods such as nuts peanut butter chocolates eggs orange juice fish and milk they may also be sensitive to plants or plant products like pollens grasses hay ragweed and mold spores animals may trigger an episode rabbits cats dogs birds and feather products like down comforters chickens hamsters gerbils physical exertion may induce an episode running too fast running up stairs emotions may intensify asthma excitement sadness worry laughing too hard crying couching getting very angry and breathing too hard
9116738 main and contributory causes of asthma include outdoor and environmental pollution in cities atmospheric pollution may be more of a problem indoor pollution re sults from poor ventilation keeping in tobacco smoke or even smoke from cooking
9116739 aspirin can also bring on an asthmatic attack in vulnerable individuals i reported in the american heart journal an account of two patients with chronic asthma who went into shock and came close to dying after taking two aspirin tablets each i advise all patients with asthma to avoid aspirin and to use acetaminophen instead i also caution them about tartrazine a commonly used food additive for coloring food which like sulfites can precipitate an acute attack
9116740 remember too if you are now or were at one time asthmatic to avoid all beta blocker drugs the prototype of the group is inderal others are marketed in the united states under the following names blocarden visken lopressor tenormin corgard and sectral these medications are very widely used in the treatment of several common conditions including angina pectoris irregularities of heart rhythm high blood pressure overactive thyroid migraine stage fright hand tremors and in eye drop form for glaucoma timoptic
9116741 if you require treatment of any of these disorders especially high blood pressure or angina ask your doctor whether you might take the calcium channel blockers instead marketed in the united states as procardia isoptin calan and cardizem not only do they not cause asthma they may actually protect against the exercise induced form
9116742 some substances are known to provoke allergic reactions if there is sensitivity detergent enzymes platinum salts cereals and grains certain wood dusts isocyanite chemicals used in polyurethane paints some printing industry chemicals and some pesticides in the presence of these and other agents the victims airways contract and excess mucus makes respira tion difficult
9116743 the columbia university college of physicians and surgeons complete home medical guide
9116744 once away from the source of distress the occupational asthma patient finds the asthma has disappeared the obvious solution is for such a patient to avoid employ ment that involves exposure to allergenic substances
9116745 asthma is a disease that develops over time in genetically predisposed patients usually part of an allergic progression asthma most often occurs in patients who first develop atopic skin diseases and allergic rhinitis in fact about 80 per cent of patients with childhood asthma also have allergies or allergic dermatitis

9116748 periodontitis tends to be more severe among people who have diabetes because diabetes lowers the ability to resist infection and slows healing an infection such as periodontitis may also cause your blood sugar level to rise which makes your diabetes more difficult to control
9116749 report any signs of gum disease including redness swelling and bleeding gums to your dentist also mention any other signs and symptoms such as dry mouth mouth sores or mouth pain
9116750 one way leads to diamonds one way leads to gold another leads you only to everything your told in your heart you wonder which of these is true the
9116751 allergy in general and asthma in particular are not psychogenic in origin while stress anger anxiety fear and frustration can all worsen an asthmatic attack or even trig ger one emotions are not the cause of the disease however once asthma becomes chromic and interferes with ones life style it may then result in psychological stress and behavioral problems especially in children these youngsters are often rendered social and psychological cripples a tragedy that is totally unnecessary these days
9116752 there are children and adults who develop asthma only af ter strenuous exercise the attack is the result of cooling evaporation and drying of the liming mucosa of the airways such exercise induced asthma can be prevented by learning which physical activity and how much of it predictably pro vokes an attack in any given individual several of my pa tients without any previous respiratory complaints suddenly developed new onset asthma a careful history revealed that the attacks started after they began to jog run or perform some other strenuous exercise so if youre asthmatic limit your physical rehabilitation1 to those activities that are fun are good for you and de not provoke wheezing

9116769 i have purchased a number of fur hats in my day but this is by far the warmest and most comfortable not only does it keep the back of my head warm but you can wrap the legs around your face to block the wind the only reason this hat did not receive 5 stars is due to the fact that i was attacked by a bird thinking it was wounded prey while i was out for a walk a rare but unfortunate occurrence when wearing an animal pelt on your head also great in the rain didnt smell at all after it was wet and it makes a great present im getting one for my wife
9116770 they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights
9116771 certain rights can never be granted to the government but must be kept in the hands of the people
9116772 a right is not something that somebody gives you it is something that nobody can take away
9116773 the worst hit are the people in kandhamal district where more than 400 churches more than 500 houses and many christian institutions have been demolished
9116774 the law enforcing agencies have not been able to contain the violent elements that are still at large
9116775 the violent mobs are destroying churches orphanages hostels of children convents of religious women and houses of christian families there appears a sense of helplessness among the christian community that has borne the brunt of the communal frenzy created by some fundamentalist organizations
9116776 one of them had died on monday and the other on tuesday both died after mobs attacked them
9116777 a third person was rescued in a critical condition but died on tuesday night in the hospital
9116778 we have given orders to shoot at sight anybody defying curfew and indulging in violence
9116779 the situation in orissa is far too worrisome and delicate there has been a total break down of law and order resulting from barbaric communal attacks by anti christian elements on innocent and peace loving christians their priests nuns religious workers their churches and organizations
9116780 efforts must be made to rein in violence and the government must intervene effectively to restore peace in the state
9116781 we will also send our own delegation to the state to take stock of ground realities
9116782 some prayer houses have been attacked and vehicles have been burnt
9116783 christians murdered swamiji but the government is lying and giving it a maoist color
9116784 naveen as an individual and police in particular are responsible for this attack orchestrated by the church on hindu at the same time a senior leader from christian relief and development organization world vision told compass that a news report about the arrest of their staff members in connection with saraswatis killing was false
9116785 three adults and one child were reportedly killed in fresh violence in barakhama kandhamal
9116786 we condemn in unequivocal terms the incident of burning alive people who belong to the christian community by vishwa hindu parishad activists and armed attacks on churches in orissa
9116787 but what has taken place has even surpassed what we expected
9116788 a source close to club dj and lohan pal samantha ronson
9116789 we write not only about different things we also write differently
9116790 swamiji saraswati was opposed to religious conversion taking place in various parts of orissa
9116791 it was a spontaneous response of the people to the shutdown
9116792 despite the negativity of the issues we have been dealing with i think tonight is more special for the boys because despite that they are here and playing
9116793 i hope whoever did this justice is served on them the victims are compensated and we can start dealing with the positives and we go to normal and it will
9116794 we all talked to our sons and the coaches got together with the team and said lets come out here play a good game and not talk about what happened
9116795 youve got to break through the barrier eventually weve done it now lets move on down the road
9116796 its been a great season and were showing no signs of letting up
9116797 theyre on a roll right now theyre playing very well at home
9116798 at the same time it doesnt mean i cant pitch well
9116799 ill deal with it when i say ill deal with it wont mean that ill ignore it ill deal with which means ill do something about it
9116800 you know that the bruise on your cheek makes you look a little like a young mel gibson in the first mad max movie
9116801 right now its a small group of what might be considered oddball turtles
9116802 but we have a lot to learn about them are they part of a more complex sea turtle migration dynamic than we ever imagined or just lost wanderers
9116803 i got a telephone call in 1988 from a jogger claiming to have witnessed a startling phenomenon
9116804 he said do you guys know there is a green sea turtle in the san gabriel river
9116805 i asked him if the turtle had claws on its feet
9116806 if the answer is yes which it almost always is its a freshwater turtle it saves me a trip
9116807 we used to think the san diego bay group was the northernmost foraging colony of green sea turtles
9116808 but it looks like the san gabriel river colony has us beat for that title
9116809 there are no words to describe this type of grandfather he is not a human being

9116811 it doesnt really go with israelis we always say that we live like brothers jew with fellow jew its like being punched no one would have expected it
9116812 it is concentrated around the family the child is king we have so many jokes about overprotective mothers
9116813 there is child abuse in israel like in any society but the reaction is usually much stronger than in other societies
9116814 there is a sense that the jewish mother doesnt do these kinds of things
9116815 how could it be that a young girl disappears and for three months nobody looks for her nobody asks any questions
9116816 how could it be that a society that always boasted its involvement care and mutual responsibility failed so shamefully
9116817 wasnt there for the girl when she was in need

9116826 he ought to retire whenever he wants whether hes 90 or 100
9116827 hes a great man and class act that a lot of us younger coaches look up to
9116828 saturday sunday and monday mark the end of an era on west mound street at cooper stadium
9116829 i want to keep him somewhere where he can be successful as soon as he learns what hes doing hell really do some damage he needs to learn how to make adjustments from pitch to pitch rather from at bat to at bat or from week to week
9116830 for me as a player it doesnt matter where youre in the lineup you still have to make adjustments from pitch to pitch whether youre in the eighth hole the ninth hole or the no 1 hole
9116831 i feel im pitched the same way that i was in the three four and five hole im still seeing a lot of breaking pitches theyre going to do whatever they need to do to get me out
9116832 at some point id like to move up but its up to washington its his choice he knows how things work and he knows whats best for the team
9116833 head athletic trainer richie bancells told me that its a minor strain
9116834 he doesnt believe that hell be able to play before the end of the series i was in there talking to the front office and were going to see what we can do to get somebody in here for tomorrow
9116835 kedatangan kami bukan untuk membicarakan masalah eksekusi tetapi ingin silaturahmi menjelang bulan ramadhan
9116836 kita sudah meminta izin ke kejaksaan untuk menjenguk sebelum bulan agustus tetapi baru akhir agustus ini kita diberi izin

9116845 how could it be that a society that always boasted its involvement care and mutual responsibility failed so shamefully
9116846 wasnt there for the girl when she was in need
9116847 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
9116848 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading
9116849 i feel a lot better now though because at least i know i will have a home to come back to
9116850 surely the anchoress has lost some of her marbles no way can the woman be this good
9116851 my god how can he pick someone like that working people why they they they know too much about real life
9116852 we did not take lightly the fact we recommended a strike
9116853 this is not just talking about 27 000 members this is talking about 27 000 members and their families
9116854 i thought it was unfair to us and to him
9116855 its a very reasoned response from those jurors because they apparently recognized this was not something they were well suited to determine
9116856 in my view its going to cause the u s attorneys to give a second thought to prosecuting soldiers for acts that occurred in combat
9116857 how many jurors have been involved in a domestic dispute in which a person was killed none you dont put those people on a jury
9116858 i dont think any of us who passed that legislation thought we were now going to have people discharged from the military being charged in federal court
9116859 there are all kinds of problems with witnesses and evidence and those kinds of things in addition to the fact that military persons are operating in an environment quite different from the normal street crime we see
9116860 but its worth taking a closer look at whether civilian juries will ever have the confidence to believe they can sit in judgment in these cases
9116861 were trying to talk now with the companies buyers retailers wholesalers to bring things back into balance
9116862 theres a real pressure out there on growers that goes beyond what the science justifies
9116863 from beginning to end this has been a very rough experience
9116864 there will be a lot of people who will benefit from this now and unfortunately in the future
9116865 after the sacrifice i made i felt a little bit abandoned by the government
9116866 it has been a great end to a short journey
9116867 breaking off diplomatic relations with tbilisi is not moscows choice and the responsibility lies with tbilisi
9116868 if european countries want to serve the foreign policy interests of the united states in my view they wont win anything from this
9116869 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
9116870 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
9116871 i have stopped using a false name so i think all parties should do the same
9116872 i will not plead in line with my standpoint as regards this court
9116873 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9116874 i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy things a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built
9116875 for the first time since the crimean war russia has no allies
9116876 we are encircled by countries that are either suspicious or alienated and very angry
9116877 unless they are russia dedicated they will move to friendlier environments sentiment is just very bad
9116878 russia is extremely cheap and most of the growth dynamics are still in place
9116879 if i look forward 12 months i want to own russia
9116880 if there is a perception of russia as a risky place or as an undesirable place to invest then the damage will be more long term
9116881 it will restrict the development of the economy and hurt the governments plans to create a more diversified economy
9116882 it is big aggressive undemocratic and irresponsible georgia who took small and innocent south ossetia
9116883 are sad about the situation and i have had many e mails from people asking why the media is reporting the situation only from one side
9116884 democratic values and cooperation with the west will be seen as a betrayal

9116890 we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily
9116891 verizon has chosen to manage its network rather than manage our customers usage

9116952 lest you forget the things your eyes have seen teach them to your children and your grandchildren
9116953 we need to win you need to prepare yourself for that situation if you have to throw one inning thats okay but if you have to throw four or five outs its okay too i have to be ready in the eighth inning
9116954 obviously im not going to abuse him hopefully there are days where we score a lot of runs and dont have to use him but the last two days weve had to use him a lot you dont want to do it for a long time but the one thing is were being smart about the way we use him
9116955 the thing is he doesnt throw a lot of pitches and that helps the situation
9116956 theyre a young fastball hitting team and im a young fastball pitcher
9116957 when im throwing fastballs i need to execute them for whatever reason against them i havent executed pitches i left some pitches up and they made me pay

9116959 the selection of gov palin means that this upcoming election will be historic but beyond making history palin brings substance and excitement she is intelligent young attractive and articulate as a woman and a mother she can attract women voters particularly those who feel disenfranchised
9116960 gov palin can work with both parties and has shown that she can clean up government corruption she has not merely talked about the energy crisis she has actively worked to create solutions
9116961 this brings about an enormously optimistic idea that for some small subset of kids with autism treatment of this pathway with a drug might reverse some symptoms
9116962 if autism is like the destruction of a house then you can burn the house knock down the beams of the house or flood the house but at the end of the day you have the same thing no house
9116963 though the pathway were modeling may only represent two percent of autistic patients
9116964 it could be pointing to exactly where in the brain things have to go wrong

9116966 last month while visiting jerusalem obama crammed a note in the western wall that was promptly fished out and posted on the internet the message was elegantly phrased as if obama a christian had anticipated that his private words to the almighty would soon be on public display in the note obama asked for protection forgiveness and wisdom a message in keeping with the humility he tries to emphasize
9116967 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that frightens us most we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented and famous actually who are you not to be your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that people wont feel insecure around you and when we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others
9116968 the two bishops have also acknowledged the excellent cooperation extended to them by the sri lankan security forces and in particular the security force commanders serving in the wanni who are in regular contact with them and have often facilitated delivery of humanitarian assistance when requested by the bishops
9116969 it is known well to every single person on this earth the reason as to why these people had been driven into escalating war zone it is the innocent people who always become human shield wherever possible you should have allowed the displaced people to get into safe areas under the control of the government
9116970 the urgency is due to my concerns for the people of kilinochchi and mullaittivu in particular and for those people in mannar and vavuniya who had been driven into kilinochchi very irresponsibly by your cadre it is known well to every single person on this earth the reason as to why these people had been driven into escalating war zone it is the innocent people who always become human shield wherever possible you should have allowed the displaced people to get into safe areas under the control of the government whether this letter will reach your hand before you yourself get displaced from your present board is in great doubt however i am duty bound to give you a timely advice
9116971 i am perhaps one of the very few who had been constantly predicting that you will never win this battle and been warning you to come back to your senses and to take some positive steps to save our people in vanni and your cadre for which several opportunities came on your way you ignored one of the reasons for it is that you had so much of confidence in your spokespersons all over the world you never realized that most of them who had lost their credibility in their own land went running to countries in europe australia canada and america to take the first place as your supporters while pretending to be supporting you they filled their pockets with the money collated in your name the offer of 20 30 commission on their collections came as an incentive for them they pretended to be more prabaharan than you
9116972 they should have been by your side by this time to give you physical and moral support
9116973 even now it is not too late for you to declare ceasefire unilaterally to lay down your arms and to agree for talks
9116974 please be assured that your declaration to drop the demand for separation will be a great incentive to the hardliners to come down from their present position and agree to give up the demand for a unitary constitution
9116975 the sinhalese now know very well of your tactics of provoking a backlash
9116976 hence please give up this barbaric tactics and follow my advice to win the international community
9116977 terrorism is an abominable phenomenon that affects all of us big and small directly or indirectly today terrorist groups network with one another globally their operations in our own experience include fundraising through the narcotic trade human smuggling procurement of arms and ammunition and money laundering all of which pose a grave threat to our societies in more ways than one sri lanka views the bimstec convention on cooperation in combating terrorism organized crime and illicit drug trafficking as an important landmark of the counter terrorism and transnational crime sector which would intensify our cooperative efforts in combating terrorism the group on intelligence sharing relating to counter terrorism and transnational crime has had two meetings in colombo these meetings have been useful in exploring ways and means to share information to combat terrorism and transnational crime enhancement of cooperation in all sectors relating to combating terrorism is crucial i therefore emphasize the urgent and dire need to further enhance cooperation within bimstec in this important area

9116983 with the addition of a marketplace the android ecosystem is becoming even more robust
9116984 i am incredibly energized by the support and amazing content ive seen so far
9116985 we already had a messaging service that can work over text messages so when we started developing a mobile app we wanted to take a huge step up from that
9116986 android is the only platform where every phone will have gps an accelerometer and where the application can run in the background
9116987 what developers want is to code for a few platforms and reach a large audience people have been developing for the iphone because of coolness factor but also because the iphone 3g has huge distribution around the world
9116988 it will come down to how fast android can build market share and create a compelling market
9116989 i am proud and honored to be here joining hands with colleagues from the nongovernmental and farmers organizations environment networks and the academic community in the promotion of organic farming
9116990 i encourage the public and local officials even in highly urbanized places such as in metro manila to plant at your own backyard to produce organic food
9116991 waste production is important to generate organic fertilizers now alaminos has been lucky for being able to produce organic food to ensure a good future for our children
9116992 okay you have the freedom to look at alternatives to the traditional brick and mortar method of education
9116993 if we give a person a choice between a b c d e f g h i and j then some of them may choose j j is a horrible choice therefore we must compel everybody to choose a
9116994 if you do not trust in god then we do not consider you one of us

9117002 it was the first poem i composed after serving time in prison i polished it before i came here finally i can go back to helping farmers in cavite and find time to develop my skills as a poet
9117003 aside from quenching my thirst for artistic freedom writing poems also allowed me to chronicle my experience inside the jail
9117004 i also maintained a journal where i put all my thoughts and anger
9117005 mga tula sa libingan ng mga buhay poems at the graveyard of the living
9117006 youre really good but that will be your last performance
9117007 ive watched the vmas in the past and the presenters are always like these mega stars like jamie foxx jennifer garner
9117008 and now you know for me to be doing that im really lucky and excited and looking forward to it
9117009 ive watched some of the videos this year and one of my favorites thats going to be up as a nominee is chris browns forever
9117010 its a really really cool video and chris brown hes like an acrobat like me i do a lot of flips and tricks and he does too
9117011 christian slaters character has two lives hes like the clumsy family man and then in his other life hes like this assassin superspy
9117012 i have the blood of his assassin side they dont know where it comes from all of a sudden im this star soccer player and im really good at martial arts
9117013 yeah there are no vampires in the treatment there may be a mermaid but im not sure i dont want to give away too much because were letting meyer run with her vision i mean i will say theres a good amount of water in the video and what else can i say
9117014 its cool its not some sort of expos on my life its nice to know were going to make a video for the sake of making a video were making something thats kind of fantastic and different and exciting but isnt about the song specifically and it isnt about me specifically
9117015 im quickly becoming super aware of how big of a deal it is im partway into twilight now i found out about stephenie through a close friend who told me i dont know if you know this but youre referenced in a couple of places on stephenies web site as being a musical inspiration for what she does and i was obviously incredibly flattered especially considering the finger she has on a lot of pop culture
9117016 so we were getting to this place where we were getting video treatments and we had seen a lot of good things but nothing that was really jumping out at us
9117017 so i said can i reach out to her and see if shed be interested in writing for the video and coming out and directing it and we got her music and she was fantastic and weve been working with her ever since
9117018 and it works so well because with my music i always try to create something super visual and create a backdrop where people can take a bunch of experiences but relate them and shes done that in a huge way with her books
9117019 she seems genuinely enthusiastic about it shes in the middle of editing her film right now so i guess the implication is that shes excited because shes taking time away from her baby to make it
9117020 but like i said im most excited because when i was making this album i wanted to find someone who was really talented and get them to write a treatment and just leave it alone and let it fly and thats exactly what were doing here
9117021 im happily heading towards my sec sch until i jus realised i didnt prepare anything
9117022 the minor iphone security issue which surfaced this week is fixed in a software update which will be released in september
9117023 despite steve jobs from day one saying the iphone was secure functionality and aesthetics of the device seem to always win out over security
9117024 apple quickly released updates to fix 3g connectivity issues this year but consistently takes many months to release security updates
9117025 contrary to public allegations tyco electronics has met or exceeded contractual requirements for the project and is prepared to vigorously defend that position
9117026 that sent from my iphone kicker either makes this e mail completely legitimate or illegitimate
9117027 we are working on some bugs which affect around two percent of the iphones shipped and hope to have a software update soon
9117028 i dont mean to draw a conclusion based on this nitpicky observation but i just thought itd be interesting to point out
9117029 ah ele comprova aquela teoria de que s abuso sexual quando o sujeito feio
9117030 i will return to my fathers house because in my fathers house even the undeserving servants have everything they need
9117031 i will go back to that church because they have always been gracious even to those who didnt deserve it
9117032 with the fact that score keeps getting better the future holds nothing but good things in the realm of big boobs karina hart merilyn sakova and christy marks are all perfect examples of what i mean their bodies are to die for and they have natural breasts that girls could only dream of getting implants in that size they are all excellent finds and represent what the future of score looks like
9117033 the jury is still out on some of the new models because the legends have been modeling for so long and have done more in their careers thats the case with linsey dawn mckenzie and merilyn sakova linsey has been modeling longer and has done a lot more therefore merilyn has a long way to go but she is definitely on the right path she is without a doubt the closest thing to linsey but merilyn would have to do at least two or three xxx videos reinvent herself constantly and may have to reach celebrity status like linsey did
9117034 we were all invited to a special week long trip to do photo and video shoots in eleuthera in the bahamas
9117035 the geoeye 1 satellite has the highest ground resolution color imagery available in the commercial marketplace and will produce high quality imagery with a very accurate geolocation it is our goal to display high resolution imagery for as much of the world as possible and geoeye 1 will help further that goal
9117036 the animals cant speak they cant call 911 this is case of a human being taking advantage of an animal that cant defend himself
9117037 she claimed to offer them up on more than one occasion she even took a week off of work to meet up with the individual
9117038 they are probably one of the more disgusting chats weve seen read
9117039 we made one more mistake than they did and that cost us
9117040 we just cant seem to get over the hump with those guys we had a great opportunity tonight we just couldnt seal the deal
9117041 its really nice having a place to go out and not be looked at as being different than anybody else
9117042 ninety percent of the guys out here are wounded veterans from world war ii all the way up to now we all deal with similar limitations and just get out there and have fun
9117043 i prayed for death pretty much every day after i got out i felt pretty much useless
9117044 it can be hard it all depends on the person all depends on where they are in the continuum of healing
9117045 some youll find that if they were really good at something before an injury occurs its really hard for them to try it if theyre not as good as they were before some are ready right away after an injury
9117046 after my injuries and the severity of what its like to be in iraq and the day to day business of being over there this is someplace we can come and play golf thats relaxing
9117047 i was always a little bit amazed that the only people that could play the course were those that could walk it they had no carts none of that stuff
9117048 its easier to get 8 000 or 10 000 worth of work donated than a check of 2 000
9117049 there is a difference between having a cookie bake sale and the type of money well need to build it
9117050 i need a little bit bigger donations than the cookie sale
9117051 i massively enjoy something that is massively enjoyable fix me im broken
9117052 ill take 90 of your stuff and your kids unless you go to this idiotic sex addict clinic
9117053 i guess they call it the yips on your serve i dont know where it came from
9117054 probably came from all my years making fun of people that had it that was my karma coming back
9117055 all i know is i have doubles at 2 30 tomorrow thats about as far as im thinking
9117056 i think its tough to make any kind of decision in a rash moment and there was no decision made before the tournament so you know i dont think its time to make a certain statement now
9117057 im going to take it back to minni minneapolis and i know they are going to go crazy when i get back there and then from there its going home
9117058 please tell me what the vp does so i can determine whether it is even a job worth holding
9117059 im in favor of anything that makes the game better
9117060 she was right in it she was in the underground tunnels when the bombs were dropping
9117061 its something you dont forget and its something that affects your life forever
9117062 she liked to talk to people and find out what their life story was about she just generally liked people and never had anything malicious about her
9117063 over 80 000 women served in our armed forces during that war
9117064 although they may not have realized it at the time these early women volunteers did much to break down the barriers for all those service women who have come after them and who continue to serve their country today so proficiently and professionally
9117065 the notable fuel efficiency of boeings 777 combined with the airplanes extensive range and large cargo capacity is something egyptair values highly in this competitive environment
9117066 as a new member of the star alliance we look forward to increasing our connectivity across the globe and bringing our passengers the utmost in cabin comfort and service with a dynamic new business class layout that will debut on the 777 300er
9117067 wed like to congratulate egyptair on its order and acquisition of boeing 777 300ers and on the airlines induction into the star alliance
9117068 the 777s operational performance with its significant savings in fuel and maintenance costs will have a positive impact on egyptairs growth plans and help the airline achieve greater profitability
9117069 i think its gonna be really cool im so excited because i saw pictures of the new field and its going to be so so bigger and im excited i cant wait
9117070 its bittersweet i spent my high school years here on the morgantown high field
9117071 when theyre away we come here and then when were away we come and watch them so its kind of a good thing except the mohawk bowl then we wanna win
9117072 when you think that you are referring to your intuition actually you just learn an association between subliminal signals in your context and the outcome of your actions
9117073 fill the void for soul music that has been missing in new york city for a long time
9117074 they say its 80 mph but it certainly seems to be over 100 mph and ive been through lots of storms
9117075 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9117076 it wasnt a georgian attack on tskhinvali that launched all of this
9117077 it was russian pressure over a long period of time and then shelling coming from south ossetians
9117078 was not a wise thing to do because as weve seen russia was prepared to launch a major invasion
9117079 today it is a fight between the civilized and the uncivilized worlds
9117080 in case of war redzikowo and slupsk will be more secure than other places and not less secure
9117081 you condemned redzikowo and slupsk to annihilation like hiroshima and nagasaki
9117082 from the point of view of polands interests we will be strategically more secure
9117083 i am the last person to seek conflict with our neighbors but as prime minister i must not leave poland defenseless
9117084 can you deny that having the shield base redzikowo will be target no 1 for countries that dont agree with it
9117085 i prefer to have here american troops rather than soviet troops
9117086 depends on you how well you are able to seize that opportunity
9117087 preparation for bad weather has been at the top of mind and we prepare for it all year
9117088 thats enough information can you show me the best muscle building supplement now
9117089 the jew evolved organized capitalism with its working instrumentality the banking system
9117090 yes she is on the eve of her fall your europe of a fall universal general terrible judaism and the banks now reign over everything as much over europe as over education over the whole of civilization and socialism particularly over socialism because with its aid judaism will tear out christianity by the roots and destroy christian culture and if nothing comes of all this but anarchy then even at the head of all will be found the jew and when all the wealth of europe has been pillaged the jew bank alone will remain
9117091 the revolution in russia is a jewish revolution a crisis in jewish history it is a jewish revolution because russia is the home of about half the jews of the world and an overturning of its despotic government must have a very important influence on the destines of the millions living there and on the many thousands who have recently emigrated to other countries but the revolution in russia is a jewish revolution also because jews are the most active revolutionists in the czars empire
9117092 there is much in the fact of bolshevism itself in the fact that so many jews are bolshevists in the fact that the ideals of bolshevism at many points are consonant with the finest ideals of judaism
9117093 over one third of the jews in russia have become officials
9117094 it is now known and clearly proved that the money was provided by a group of international financiers with headquarters in berlin stockholm and new york while lenin took with him from switzerland a number of alien revolutionaries collected from all parts of europe his chief lieutenant trotsky brought with him a horde of aliens from the united states trotsky himself was in prison in halifax nova scotia when the call came for him to join lenin in russia his release from prison so that he might assist lenin in organizing the bolshevik revolution is a mystery that has never been explained what powerful influence compelled the british authorities to order his release and to grant permission for his transport to russia
9117095 obscure international speculator who acquired an enormous fortune and styled himself as the ideal inspirer of bolshevism
9117096 the bolsheviks used to obtain large sums of money from an unknown source abroad
9117097 how the subsidized alien revolutionaries having invaded russia proceeded to murder and rob on a wholesale scale has been recorded by many persons who had the misfortune to be in russia during the bolshevik revolution all are agreed that the leaders of the revolution and the persons responsible for the most brutal and revolting murders were jews
9117098 at one time trotsky was a favorite with jacob schiff
9117099 during the war trotsky edited novy mir and conducted mass meetings in new york when he left the united states to return to russia he is said on good authority to have traveled on schiffs money and under schiffs protection he was captured by the british at halifax and immediately on advice from a highly placed personage set free shortly after his arrival in russia he was informed that he had a credit in sweden at the swedish branch of the bank owned by max warburg of hamburg this credit helped to finance the seizure of the russian revolution by the international jewish bankers
9117100 students of radicalism know that the present soviet government in russia was organized by aliens and usurpers and not representative of the thoughts and ideals of the one hundred and fifty million citizens of russia
9117101 i want to remind loyal americans that it is well to remember the boring from within tactics pursued by these aliens and usurpers in soviet russia caused the downfall of their government and the setting up of the present communist jewish control government which is now in operation and to point out that the same kind of aliens and usurpers are now at work in the united states to establish a form of government other than constitutional government and in order to do this they are seeking to paralyze industry to destroy patriotism and finally to secure the overthrow of government itself in the united states
9117102 krassin thus played a dual role on one hand representing the interests of the great german jewish capitalists and on the other acting as lieutenant of lenin whose avowed aim was to destroy capitalism if any further evidence were needed of the connection between bolshevism and international finance the case of krassin would provide it
9117103 as long as there are idiots to take our signature serious and to put their trust in it we must promise everything that is asked and as much as one likes if we can only get something tangible in exchange
9117104 did not need any financial assistance and that a large percentage of loans from the united states was lent to russia
9117105 if we are going to do business with russia let us do it directly and not through germany which has arranged to give soviet russia millions of dollars credit to purchase commodities in germany
9117106 please accept on this the seventeenth anniversary of the establishment of the soviet government the assurance of my best wishes for the welfare and prosperity of your country

9117117 those of us whove known john mccain since he began his arizona political career made two mistakes
9117118 after the experience we all had with president clinton im not inclined to disco unt the view of home state reporters and journalists who have covered a candidate over the years
9117119 ive never tried to exploit my vietnam service to my country because it would be totally inappropriate
9117120 he mccain sees no connection between twisting our arms for money and then talking about how corrupt the 0a system is

9117129 denver colorado former vice president al gore started his speech tonight by talking about how the world would be different had he ended up in the white house in 2000
9117130 before he entered the white house abraham lincoln s experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield ill
9117131 the experience lincoln s supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9117132 he was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land he insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
9117133 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs
9117134 the steps taken by the alaska state legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs
9117135 over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process
9117136 we in alaska feel that crunch and are taking steps to address it right here at home
9117137 this is a tool that must be on the table to buy us time until our long term energy plans can be put into place we have already enjoyed the support of alaska senator ted stevens and it is gratifying to see senator obama get on board

9117204 for so many americans governor palin is a bit of a mystery
9117205 a few days of whos this head scratching the first impression people get until she steps on the convention stage will be through the media
9117206 if its positive coverage shes a mom shes caring for a disabled child she can meet men on their own terms if thats the rap that comes through they are home free
9117207 if the coverage is negative it will be very hard to change the narrative

9117219 texas state played very well tonight and gave us all they had
9117220 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9117221 to have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9117222 i dont know if you showed the cake there that they had there three years ago today with mccain and bush when marie antoinette when she said let them eat cake i think she was speaking figuratively they literally were while was drowning eating cake so its um i dont know lets hope things get better
9117223 i congratulate my fellow western governor sarah palin and her family last night barack obama made history and today sarah palin did the same by being named the first female republican vice presidential nominee
9117224 shes been a committed public servant and a dedicated mother
9117225 as a mother myself i sincerely commend her for that knowing that it takes strong devotion and focus having worked with governor palin i know that she truly believes in her work and has been a strong leader for alaska and its people
9117226 when barack obama announced joe biden as his nominee for vice president he said his decision was not only based on him being a good partner but also someone who was ready to lead with governor palin only having two years of experience as alaskas governor and serving as mayor of a small city prior to that its something the voters need to consider and weigh carefully as this election progresses
9117227 as the head of alaskas national guard and as the mother of a soldier herself governor palin understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops taking as his running mate the governor from our great northern neighbor was an excellent decision by sen mccain
9117228 while the obama biden ticket is big on talk the mccain palin ticket is big on results to truly change washington its going to take a team who has a record of accomplishment in shaking up the status quo gov palins experience in doing that for her own state is exactly what is needed in washington d c and its the same kind of change we need in olympia this year
9117229 she is a reform candidate and washington d c outsider who is capable of bringing about change i met her in 2006 while doing a fundraiser up in alaska for her gubernatorial campaign and was very impressed she is bright articulate and a good choice for mccain
9117230 when elected to congress i appointed the first female sheriff to succeed me in the king county sheriffs office
9117231 so today im very pleased and encouraged to see the first female gop candidate for vice president this sets exactly the right example for our young women who we must continually empower and encourage to pursue positions of leadership both professionally and politically
9117232 let them over reach and let them punch him again and again and then he turned around and destroyed them if the rove republicans thought they were playing with a patsy they just got a reality check

9117244 i saw those people the salaf and how they were more careful about their time than about their dirhams and din rs i

9117254 they just didnt have anything else to do probably i havent thought much about that stuff its a funny deal i thought a lot more about it a year ago than i do this year everything to me is almost like its back to normal there was so much made over nobody ever won three in a row it seems like it was a relief when we did it i havent heard anybody in the locker room talk about four and all that stuff its not even in the back of my mind like the three was
9117255 all of a sudden its the democrats who rejected a woman for the ticket and the republicans who added a woman to the ticket so all of a sudden its back to the drawing board

9117329 we preached intensity and we let them back into the game
9117330 when the game was on the line we drove it right down the field and on fourth and an inch we threw a touchdown pass and that ballgame was ours
9117331 we can dictate the tempo that is what we are good at when we had to and slow it down a little bit and run some clock

9117340 we all know why we brought him here we brought him in to use him as a specialist type of player pass rusher we used him at the end position we used him at the linebacker position
9117341 he busted his tail and did everything he could do we moved him around best we could but when all was said and done the decision was made for a player that would do more things especially from a standpoint of special teams
9117342 we had another mri ordered the other day and were assessing that and were assessing where we feel like he is as a player and what his contribution can be on this football team this year we want to exhaust every opportunity we can to make a good decision on that so thats what were doing
9117343 weve already done some work as a pro scouting staff to anticipate where we think some players may be or who might be available
9117344 certainly we will continue to look at that and then once the releases actually happen well take a look at who might be available and what are some of our other options if in fact chris is not available to us
9117345 that is a concern as far as who backs up fred bennett inside in nickel situations

9117361 kami mengimbau perusahaan perusahaan kehutanan dan perkebunan yang sedang dan akan beroperasi di semenanjung kampar untuk segera menghentikan konversi mengingat betapa dahsyatnya kerusakan akibat deforestasi di lanskap itu
9117362 pemerintah diharapkan juga melakukan peninjauan ulang perizinan konversi yang telah dikeluarkan di semenanjung kampar
9117363 adanya pola pemanfaatan hutan seperti hph dan hti di lahan gambut disebabkan dari sejak awal keberadaan gambut tidak pernah dipertimbangkan pemerintah dalam penentuan kawasan hutan dan pengelolaannya
9117364 setting priorities for the conservation and recovery of wild tigers 2005 2015
9117365 mereka sama sekali meremehkan dampak kerusakan ekosistem yang berpengaruh global akibat perusakan lahan gambut padahal kerugiannya jauh lebih tinggi secara finansial maupun ekologis dibanding keuntungan yang mereka raup
9117366 kepentingan ekonomi segelintir pihak janganlah merugikan kemaslahatan orang banyak di muka bumi ini karena perusakan hutan dan ekosistem kampar jelas memicu eskalasi perubahan iklim
9117367 terlebih lagi bencana ekologis lainnya seperti turunnya permukaan gambut dan banjir besar terlebih dulu akan menghantam penduduk riau
9117368 sudah saatnya semua pihak terkait memberikan perhatian serius kepada ancaman global yang tengah dihadapi semenanjung kampar saat ini
9117369 jika tidak ada kebijakan pro konservasi yang diambil maka bukan indonesia saja yang akan menanggung akibatnya namun masyarakat regional maupun global akibat perubahan iklim yang dipicu kerusakan kampar

9117387 it wasnt a good experience it was not a safe place to be
9117388 it was really tough i had to do most things by myself
9117389 the goal is to provide ancillary expenses so that these kids wont have a financial burden
9117390 its extremely difficult and disheartening to these kids coming from behind and moving from foster house to foster house we want to give them an opportunity to go to college and succeed
9117391 i always had this nagging feeling what if i remained an orphan would i have had the same opportunities
9117392 ive always wanted to do something like this to create something that will go well beyond me lifetime we want this program to thrive not just in connecticut but throughout the nation
9117393 i was really happy to get the scholarship because its hard to go to school and have to pay for so many things
9117394 i want to help kids who dont have parents or have anywhere to go
9117395 ive come to realize that in the genocide they could have killed me i believe that i was saved and im healthy and doing well it gives me hope that there is something more out there for me
9117396 we had just gotten to feeling katrina was over and we could get back to normal
9117397 now its like here we go again its very scary
9117398 who would think that three years after katrina nature would be knocking on our door again
9117399 we cant afford another one like katrina we cant seem to win for losing
9117400 he stayed on after dinner and played monopoly with me
9117401 they had a rest camp in the town where i lived out in the woods every time theyd go out to battle theyd come back to the rest camp i only saw him when he came back
9117402 he read this memoir a couple of times and about the third time he sat down and wrote
9117403 dear thelma i wonder if anybody has honored your request to correspond with you if you have heard from anyone you dont need to answer this letter
9117404 id gone back there three times including the first time and when i left the third time we were unofficially engaged
9117405 chauncey is such a special person hes so sincere hes so caring
9117406 i told him hes so handsome i would have married him on the spot
9117407 its nice to see that love still exists as you get older
9117408 even if you havent had love for years you can still find it in your 90s
9117409 no way itll be very natural weve both been married before for a long time so we know what its like
9117410 you see i made the big move in the very beginning when i moved from australia to connecticut
9117411 i was the first woman to graduate from bullard havens in auto shop
9117412 the smart young men had no problems working with me because i always did my best
9117413 its just another responsibility and i want to set an example for all women and for women to come
9117414 it was more of the boys will be boys type of criticism so i knew they were just kidding around
9117415 you shouldnt worry about the boys you should just do whatever shop you want to do
9117416 some people didnt think i would be able to do some of the things like plumbing but i got the highest grade
9117417 the boys were surprised but not critical because they asked me for help
9117418 some companies discriminate a little and dont like to hire women but we dont single one gender out
9117419 when i first started and i would go to the plumbing supply house to get supplies and the men would try and help me i would immediately say no because i felt i had something to prove
9117420 now i would probably take them up on their offer
9117421 but most of the time people just comment on how great they think it is to see a woman in the trade
9117422 its possible to make a good and enjoyable career with your hands
9117423 some women just have a problem envisioning themselves doing a trade
9117424 if women arent exposed to these possibilities they dont know they are there
9117425 its really a shame because these trades are a way for women to receive pension and health benefits and better their lives and if we only show them jobs where they are receiving minimum wage they wont know they have options
9117426 a lot of students want to take classes but their parents advise them not to
9117427 they dont realize how many opportunities are available in the automotive field
9117428 you always have something to prove as a female ive just come to accept it
9117429 i wouldnt doubt that there are a lot of backstroms around
9117430 i think it will be a great resource for people who want to do art history in connecticut

9117432 always made enough money to live on i never had to worry
9117433 im hoping the public will be able to add more information
9117434 yaa semoga kita bisa memanfaatkan ramadhan ini dengan sebaik baiknya mari awali bulan penuh rahmat ini dengan hati yang bersih dan tak ada cara yang lebih baik untuk membersihkan hati selain dengan saling memaafkan

9117441 reforming admissions policies would be a good place to start in stopping discrimination
9117442 there are faith schools that are 90 or even 100 funded by the tax payer and yet they only cater or prioritise 5 of the population often faith schools take pupils only from their own faith or even from their own denomination within a faith
9117443 90 of the population have been ruled out straight away

9117893 on the contrary they are worth something in future negotiations with other partners either in similar economic partnership agreements or with individual investors but are now devalued because we already gave them away to japan
9117894 among those we gave away are automotive vehicles and their parts
9117895 most like electronics and furniture are duty free hence duty free entry under the jpepa has no added value
9117896 pressed hard enough for special and differential treatment which is our due it could have gotten us a better deal than what we ended up with

9117913 the statement that i believe we want to make is just to win
9117914 thats the no 1 thing we want to play sharp play disciplined and get a win
9117915 i think what happens with that whole situation is you go into the game with a plan and then you see how hes reacting and then you make adjustments as you go along it could go either way
9117916 we could be conservative or we could go after him well just see how the game goes
9117917 its an interesting matchup because theyre a good defense and we have nine out of 11 starters back on offense
9117918 we have a quarterback thats played some they have a quarterback that hasnt played much at all

9117954 they may sound the same but they perform very different functions in the warehouse think of the wcs as bridging the gap between corporate software applications such as erp and wms host systems and the programmable logic controllers plc and or pc based cell controllers that control the material handling equipment
9117955 many warehouse management systems communicate with material handling equipment such as pick to light ptl conveyors a frame print and apply etc in most cases the wms is interfaced directly to those pieces of equipment the limitation of the wms is that it doesnt link all of those areas of automation together the wms can download data to the ptl or a frames telling them what picks are required from that area but it lacks the ability to orchestrate the flow of material through the warehouse it is safe to say that anyone thats been in a high volume facility understands that the ebb and flow of material doesnt go smoothly therefore if you have one section of the warehouse controlled by a material handling subsystem running at a certain rate and another area running at a different rate youve created an imbalance
9117956 warehouse control systems were designed to control the warehouse floor and islands of automation they provide the capability to route products and regulate the workflow between areas of automation they provide real time information directly to management to enable them to take the necessary action in an environment thats never constant the mix of orders in a warehouse on any given day can vary consider ably the warehouse manager needs to move people from one area to another to handle the hot spots the wcs provides management with the visibility and the tools to manage the systems and the people by deploying them in the most effective manner to get the right product out the door at the right time in an uninterrupted steady flow

9117963 i have to know im being productive for my mother
9117964 my mother is the most loving accepting forgiving angel on earth
9117965 i said when you go to heaven and become an angel i will go back home and do sports with the kids and go back to work and think about taking some nursing classes
9117966 at this time im not overly concerned because we have to wait and see if the signatures are authentic
9117967 im confident we can beat it if it goes to the ballot if this issue goes to the ballot its really a waste of the citys resources money that could be better spent on core services that positively impact residents
9117968 i told them that before you make these things a recommendation to the court on whether detention is warranted you go spend time in a jail cell
9117969 the judge is the final arbiter of our cases and when the judge tells you to do something you do it

9117983 a friend of mine said you want to raise horses out west
9117984 we must have searched for a place for three years then one day we were riding around this property and we saw three bull elk grazing in a field that sold me
9117985 ive always had horses and for at least the last half century or so all arabians
9117986 the polish kings brought these horses from saudi arabia 600 years ago then they tweaked the arabian breed for sound mind and athletic body
9117987 theres an emotional spiritual dimension to why we respond certain ways to horses
9117988 the arabians are so high spirited theyre not vicious but they want to test you

9117993 that could mean even more jobs than intel provided because they never operated the plant at full capacity
9117994 if they built those things so that it would have some re adaptive use it would be great
9117995 but they dont do that its just a tough deal
9117996 the problem is it drives the price of real estate down
9117997 if a speculative buyer is going to reinvest in the building and make all these changes hes got to buy it right thats why you see people wanting to really pay a minimal amount for a property like that because of the retrofit costs
9117998 i think i was just seeing it better there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up it was just one of those days when i made about a 15 footer on the first hole and another one on the second hole and then i had an 8 footer on the third hole and it looked easy
9117999 right now i feel really good thats all i can say
9118000 i feel good with my swing im hitting the ball good im healthy im strong and ill tell you what i feel a lot better right now on the greens than i did then so that should tell you something
9118001 its just the kind of round you wish you could play every day
9118002 i hit it well and made some putts and i probably would have been happy with 2 putts on 18 but it snuck in and just made an already good round better

9118006 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9118007 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9118008 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9118009 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9118010 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9118011 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9118012 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9118013 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9118014 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
9118015 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema

9118019 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9118020 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9118021 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9118022 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9118023 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale

9118056 the track was getting better and better and we needed a few laps to get the michelins up to operating temperature the corvette c6 r worked very well under the circumstances
9118057 it was a matter of thinking about how i drove the track last year remembering my braking points and so on everybody was trying to find the right line i didnt get a clear lap but i dont think anyone did im happy with the result this makes the race a little easier
9118058 the track was drying and it wasnt as good at the beginning of the session as it was at the end
9118059 we sent the drivers out to get a time and then brought them back in if the drivers dont get a qualifying time and the session ends early because of a red flag the cars would start at the back of the grid our strategy was to put a time down let the track dry out and then run when the conditions were better

9118062 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9118063 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale

9118068 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9118069 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9118070 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9118071 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9118072 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9118073 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano

9118103 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9118104 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

9118122 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat
9118123 somebody may beat me but they are going to have to bleed to do it
9118124 the will to win means nothing without the will to prepare
9118125 what we have is based upon moment to moment choices of what we do in each of those moments we choose we either take a risk and move toward what we want or we play it safe and choose comfort most of the people most of the time choose comfort in the end people either have excuses or experiences reasons or results buts or brilliance they either have what they wanted or they have a detailed list of all the rational reasons why not

9118127 you will be what you will to be let failure find its false content in that poor word environment but spirit scorns it and is free it masters time it conquers space it cows that boastful trickster chance and bids the tyrant circumstance uncrown and fill a servants place the human will that force unseen the offspring of a deathless soul can hew the way to any goal though walls of granite intervene be not impatient in delay but wait as one who understands when spirit rises and commands the gods are ready to obey the river seeking for the sea confronts the dam and precipice yet knows it cannot fail or miss you will be what you will to be

9118135 the minute you start talking about what youre going to do if you lose you have lost
9118136 caring matters deeply to individuals families and society in general
9118137 sustaining the ability of carers to provide the care and support they give to others is of critical importance
9118138 the two tier benefit recommended by the committee would be a major improvement to the current system
9118139 carers need a separate benefit which recognises that they are not unemployed but are making an important contribution to society
9118140 the committees excellent report lays bare the extent to which carers struggle to access the support they need while carrying out one of the most valuable jobs in our society
9118141 carers save our health and social care systems billions of pounds and they deserve a better deal in return

9118155 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
9118156 i have not been personally charged or served i have asked my legal counsel at both offices if they know anything about it the only thing i have seen on it is the anonymous guest post on blue maumau
9118157 do i think a franchisor should have an entity like elite which was allowed to accept money and sign purchase orders before a franchise agreement was approved no i dont was it structured in way that probably met legal requirements i think it probably was but does that make it right no
9118158 i do think its a crime to have 168 stores sitting out here on the pipeline that need to be built out that need to get opened thats why my focus has been to resolve these construction issues
9118159 sbt had been a company that previous ownership and management had partnered with to do build outs so elite was intended to serve as a construction management company it was to manage the process of build outs for franchisees they in turn then subcontracted out the construction aspects of the projects to sbt as it related to in line construction
9118160 it was simply based on an initial agreement for one project and then that parlayed into additional projects being completed the way the business was being conducted is what dictated the relationship
9118161 what i quickly realized and understood was that because one of the principals of sbt and mbm had been made the president of elite that created a lot of conflict it created a lot of bad business decisions being made and there was sloppy bookkeeping on both ends it created somewhat of a nightmare
9118162 a lot has been said in the blogs about the infamous exhibit d which is where i had supposedly agreed to continue to use sbt but what has been missed is that i agreed that projects that had been sold where elite contracts were in place prior to the acquisition sbt would be able to continue to do the build outs contingent upon their ability to perform the work to perform it well in a reasonable amount of time and at a fair price
9118163 if they were unable to do those constructions i was not in any way bound to continue to use them
9118164 we showed them factually what we believe the number to be and we have agreed to pay them those monies if they settle the agreement
9118165 with the remaining stores we are continuing to assist franchisees to find good locations
9118166 so they had a proven track record in getting coffee shops open opened quickly across the country being part of a network of experienced contractors we finally got the agreement finalized and as of monday they were on their first five job sites
9118167 our goal currently is to do 16 stores a month and ramp up from there
9118168 when i acquired the franchise elite had the construction agreements with the franchisees cuppys the franchisor had the funding for cuppys as they opened the 168
9118169 im putting money into the company and company is putting money into the projects in a round about way i guess its fair to say yes i am putting money into the company to cover some of these projects but these are very few projects
9118170 so of the 168 projects weve got seven or eight that we are having to struggle through but we are going to be able to take care of them
9118171 the company had an enormous overhead in ft walton beach florida as publicized it had 146 employees at one time it has also been reported that it leased 19 000 sq ft of office space overlooking the gulf of mexico which was not cheap real estate
9118172 we are bringing the company in line so we can operate within a budget as opposed to going outside and pulling in equity investors with the current state of the company not a lot of people would be interested in investing
9118173 the real key to that is getting our stores open in the shortest amount of time
9118174 well gradually be building up the cuppys side the franchisor side based on the revenues from those future royalties on the stores to be opened
9118175 when i woke up the other morning and saw that posting on blue maumau falsely stating that dale nabors was served with federal charges i thought about my children in school and having one of their friends coming up to them and saying hey i hear your daddy was served with federal charges
9118176 there is no money to be made with the mess we have right now

9118187 there are a lot of rumors and things being said right now
9118188 nobody in my office nor myself has ever been contacted by any investigatory agency
9118189 if i could say more i would but you know these are sensitive matters and it is not our intention to interfere with an investigation
9118190 if a public official has been contacted by authorities and has cooperated on matters of mutual interest you can determine whether theres an investigation or not
9118191 never once ever did pat approach me approach the chairman of his board approach anyone at the ura to suggest that there was any kind of corruption or decisions being made that werent in the best interests of the residents
9118192 i think clearly he has decided to attack others to potentially benefit himself

9118213 it could be the beginning of a career for women their lives have been so horrible by the time they get here its really nice for them to be recognized as being competent at something to take care of something
9118214 theyve had a lot of chaos in their lives and to be able to go sit in a quiet peaceful place and know that it was made for them i think that means a lot
9118215 that thing is a monster you couldnt get it into that jar

9118229 the big question now is whether ubs the supposed giant of swiss banking will have the guts to take a strong stand based on the swiss bank secrecy laws and fight for the principle of its clients financial privacy
9118230 i underlined however that we expect them not to take unilateral steps against ubs to obtain information which is located in switzerland as long as the agreed bilateral legal cooperation is ongoing
9118231 ubs is seeking to address these requests with both swiss and u
9118232 this is a direct and coordinated attack on the heart of the swiss financial system

9118267 i didnt think it was going to happen my leg hurt so bad the whole game i didnt know if i was going to finish
9118268 they put together a great game plan and did a great job against us they didnt show us a lot in their scrimmage so they came out with a lot of stuff we hadnt seen
9118269 in the second half the heat the fatigue and the injuries just killed us but the biggest thing that hurt us was turnovers turnovers just killed us
9118270 i think its a little bit of a conditioning issue
9118271 i just told perlotte to find me and he just threw it up over my shoulder
9118272 im just glad i could finish the game we work so hard in practice this was definitely a team effort
9118273 they could run but they werent doing it in a choreographed effort with everybody running in the same direction
9118274 theyre coming out hard and theyve got a coach whos putting it in their heads that they can win
9118275 as a senior its frustrating for me and its frustrating for the team
9118276 i put this team on my shoulders and ive got to do whatever i can to help them win weve just got to keep working hard
9118277 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9118278 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9118279 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9118280 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9118281 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9118282 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9118283 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9118284 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9118285 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9118286 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9118287 no one works for someone we all just work together
9118288 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9118289 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9118290 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9118291 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9118292 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9118293 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9118294 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9118295 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9118296 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9118297 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9118298 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9118299 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9118300 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9118301 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9118302 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9118303 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9118304 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9118305 a lady in her car saw the plane and got out and ran
9118306 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9118307 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9118308 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9118309 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9118310 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9118311 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9118312 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9118313 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9118314 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9118315 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9118316 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9118317 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9118318 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9118319 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9118320 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9118321 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9118322 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9118323 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9118324 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9118325 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9118326 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9118327 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9118328 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9118329 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9118330 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9118331 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9118332 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9118333 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9118334 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9118335 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9118336 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9118337 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9118338 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9118339 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9118340 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9118341 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9118342 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9118343 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9118344 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9118345 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9118346 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9118347 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9118348 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9118349 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9118350 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9118351 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9118352 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9118353 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9118354 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9118355 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9118356 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9118357 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9118358 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9118359 pterosaurs have no thumb it was the one that was lost the digits are i ii iii amp iv with iv being the pinky finger which is also the wingfinger if youd rather not believe me you might ask chris bennett kevin padian wann langston jr peter wellnhofer john conway mike habib dave unwin or greg paul conway will be off on his honeymoon this coming week so he probably wont respond immediately all the best

9118361 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9118362 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9118363 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9118364 the cab was on one side of the train and the tanker on the other
9118365 in my opinion that was a heroic effort because if they didnt there was nothing to stop that train between here and enid

9118369 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9118370 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9118371 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9118372 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9118373 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9118374 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9118375 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9118376 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9118377 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9118378 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9118379 lack of experience on national political issues including foreign policy and homeland security and her only brief experience as governor
9118380 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9118381 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9118382 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9118383 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9118384 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9118385 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9118386 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9118387 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9118388 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9118389 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9118390 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9118391 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9118392 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9118393 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9118394 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9118395 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9118396 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9118397 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9118398 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9118399 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9118400 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9118401 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9118402 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

9118414 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9118415 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9118416 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9118417 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9118418 im sorry that this his death was how his kindness was repaid
9118419 i want people to know that our family is proud of kazuya
9118420 well make sure we continue our activities in afghanistan its what ito would have wanted
9118421 as the person in charge i felt truly sorry for his parents
9118422 its something that kazuya asked a local musician to make for him
9118423 he received it because his activities and work were appreciated
9118424 well temporarily pull japanese staff out but continue our work with local staff as ito would have wanted
9118425 as a parent id like someone to take over his activities but safety is the first priority this continuation of activities should only happen once its been properly established that the area is safe

9118431 yeah but stu youre giving away 50 of the profits thats a big chunk of money
9118432 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9118433 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9118434 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9118435 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9118436 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9118437 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9118438 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9118439 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9118440 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9118441 we wanted people to have access to as many materials as possible in one place
9118442 people might not think it but sustainable materials are gorgeous
9118443 you use what you have to keep things out of junkyards and landfills
9118444 it feels good to have products in your home that are environmentally friendly
9118445 its about detoxifying yourself and not passing it on to your children so they grow into healthy adults
9118446 its knowing where your products come from and supporting your local community
9118447 its nothing noble it just sounded like a good fit and a good cause
9118448 we chose healing colors a lot of pinks blues purples whites very soft colors
9118449 these things are sustainable these things will last with minimal care
9118450 the fact that they have a nice environment around them i think it reflects our respect for who they are which is something they are in great need of
9118451 its a beautiful old building with a lot of nice space that we could be filling up with color and plants we always strive to have the facility inside and out match our philosophy and values this should be a place that is healing that is welcoming that creates a kind of environment and atmosphere to begin their recovery
9118452 it could be the beginning of a career for women their lives have been so horrible by the time they get here its really nice for them to be recognized as being competent at something to take care of something
9118453 theyve had a lot of chaos in their lives and to be able to go sit in a quiet peaceful place and know that it was made for them i think that means a lot
9118454 that thing is a monster you couldnt get it into that jar
9118455 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9118456 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9118457 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9118458 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

9118465 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9118466 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9118467 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9118468 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9118469 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9118470 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

9118472 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
9118473 found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men 15 other villagers were wounded or otherwise injured
9118474 the afghan people and the afghan government have lost their patience
9118475 we cannot see our children being killed in our villages or the killing of innocent people and our hope and strong request is to reach a new agreement with the international community which clarifies all the conditions so that in the future the fight against terrorism should happen in the boundary of law so that civilians are not affected
9118476 the prospect of codifying the ad hoc rules under which u s forces have operated in afghanistan since late 2001 sends shudders through the bush administration
9118477 so youd have a multiplicity of players on that side
9118478 to us and the u s and afghan troops we were covering it appeared as though they were victorious

9118497 i am going to give this 20 to one of you but first let me do this
9118498 my friends we have all learned a very valuable lesson no matter what was done to the money you still wanted it because it did not decrease in value it was still worth 20
9118499 many times in our lives we are dropped crumpled and ground into the dirt by the decisions we make and the circumstances that come our way we feel as though we are worthless
9118500 but no matter what has happened or what will happen you will never lose your value

9118504 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9118505 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9118506 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9118507 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9118508 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9118509 who are open to doing something on the production side
9118510 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9118511 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9118512 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9118513 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9118514 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9118515 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions

9118517 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9118518 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9118519 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9118520 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9118521 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9118522 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9118523 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9118524 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9118525 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9118526 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9118527 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9118528 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9118529 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9118530 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9118531 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9118532 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9118533 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9118534 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9118535 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9118536 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9118537 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9118538 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9118539 they are refugees now because they have left their homes they are living in the forests and they should be brought back
9118540 it is the responsibility of the government that these refugees should be brought back and also to send for force if necessary to stop this killing to stop this burning to stop this looting
9118541 i express spiritual closeness and solidarity to the brothers and sisters in faith who are being so harshly tested
9118542 man i dont know i just have this feeling this year if our transfer juco qb can come around and the 12 freshmen on our offensive line can step up i think our brand new inexperienced coordinator will have a lot to work with and it wont really matter than our only scholarship running back runs a 23 minute 40 shoot we might surprise some folks in the insert conference of choice
9118543 ok your name what we need you to do today is to go to a college campus full of hot pussy and be good looking on national television oh and be sure to watch plenty of football talk about plenty of football and hang out with plenty of uber famous football coaches anyway heres your hotel key and a few extra copies for any big busty sluts that happen to throw themselves in the general vicinity of your cock during the upcoming thursday sunday time frame
9118544 a strict curfew is in force please stay indoors and dont come out for congregational prayers
9118545 i think his plan is made he wants an election period
9118546 the keyboard is mightier than the sword even a blogger can no longer tolerate the quality of governance that the country is having now
9118547 a lot of people have come alive in the last 10 years theyre the reformasi generation and they think about politics in fundamentally different ways
9118548 i think a lot of people feel that jeff oois following has diminished because of his direct participation in politics
9118549 a computer virus is alive and well on the international space station iss
9118550 hezbollah succeeded in incorporating the idea of resistance as part of the international anti globalization movements
9118551 through our contacts with these groups we have managed to challenge the idea that hezbollah is a dogmatic terrorist islamist organization and convince part of the international left that we can be a strong partner
9118552 we think of the sacrifices of all the militants in lebanon and palestine and the arab world from islamists to nationalists to arabists or any ideological background they come from
9118553 hezbollah is aware today of the importance of cultivating contacts with the west
9118554 social forums are open spaces of discussion they present an opportunity for a group like hezbollah to participate and give their opinions
9118555 it was a potent symbol that right makes might and that a guerrilla ready to fight for its people can succeed
9118556 some leftist groups refuse to consider what islamist organizations are about their oppressive practices their violations of rights their dogmatic rhetoric

9118569 guys have been giving me a hard time all year about not having a walk off home run
9118570 every time we go into extra innings i have to listen to it now i guess theyll have to say something else
9118571 im sure if you play long enough youre going to hit one
9118572 everybody has little things in their statistical career that might make you scratch your head some guys never hit a grand slam or hit a bunch of them its one of those things but im glad to get the zero off there
9118573 every time we call upon one of those guys out there they do the job
9118574 this is probably since ive been here the best ive thrown
9118575 i was able to command my pitches and got into trouble a couple of times and was able to get out it
9118576 i thought that was going to win the game and it hooked just foul at the end
9118577 i didnt hit it as good as the first one but good enough to get it in the crawford seats and ill take it

9118581 dan diantara tanda tanda kekuasaan nya ialah dia menciptakan untukmu istri istri dari jenismu sendiri supaya kamu cenderung dan merasa tenteram kepadanya dan dijadikannya diantaramu rasa kasih dan sayang sesungguhnya pada yang demikian itu benar benar terdapat tanda tanda bagi kaum yang berfikir
9118582 telah ditulis atas anak adam bagiannya dari hal zina yang akan ditemui dalam hidupnya tidak bisa tidak zinanya mata adalah melihat zinanya telinga adalah mendengar zinanya kaki adalah berjalan dan zinanya hati adalah keinginan dan berangan angan dan semua itu dibenarkan atau didustakan oleh kelaminnya
9118583 katakanlah kepada orang orang yang beriman agar mereka menundukkan sebagian dari pandangan mata terhadap wanita dan memelihara kemaluan mereka yang demikian itu lebih suci bagi mereka sesungguhnya allah mengetahui apa yang mereka kerjakan dan katakanlah kepada wanita yang beriman hendaklah mereka menahan pandangannya dan memelihara kemaluannya dan janganlah mereka menampakkan perhiasannya kecuali yang biasa nampak daripadanya
9118584 dan janganlah kalian mendekati zina sesungguhnya zina itu suatu perbuatan yang keji dan suatu jalan yang buruk
9118585 one thought kept coming back to me as i watched that movie
9118586 what would those women think of the way i use or dont use my right to vote all of us take it for granted now not just younger women but those of us who did seek to learn
9118587 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
9118588 the bad things in life open your eyes to the good things that you werent paying attention to before
9118589 feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it
9118590 if we can stay free of the injury bug then we should be ok
9118591 its just a waste of everybodys time in general were playing the
9118592 im not used to sitting out but its something you learn from and ive gotten better from it and ill be a better player in the end you learn the tempo what to expect on game day how stuff changes on game day because as much film as you want to watch during the week teams are going to throw extra stuff at you so its been good in that regard
9118593 he manages the game very well and thats not a negative theres nothing wrong with that
9118594 but hes not just a game manager his rookie year when he came in obviously the package we had for him was limited and with our defense and special teams we asked him basically to do that for the most part but he is so much better of a quarterback than that its a positive that he does manage the game and has great presence and football intelligence all that and but he can do much more than that
9118595 i would like to be out there a lot more
9118596 but sometimes you have to get the other guys some work and get them going if i have to take a backseat and get some spot work here and there i guess my time has to be in the classroom and studying and learning
9118597 i play in the trenches dude thats like dog years
9118598 i dont know i dont pay attention to fantasy football in the first place

9118615 het is midden in de nacht en ik lig in bed met de man van mijn dromen je slikt toch wel de pil h
9118616 als die in het rood staat gaan we tanken dus stoppen dus plassen eerder niet
9118617 niet echt verder heb ik een krappe agenda naast de kinderen en mijn sociale verplichtingen hou ik gewoon niet zoveel tijd over om te daten
9118618 ik kom wel eens een leuke jongen tegen met wie het dan ook nog eens klikt totdat hij me ziet wegrijden op een fiets met van die kinderzitjes dan zie ik hem denken laat maar
9118619 o dat ken ik toen ik een keer tegen een man vertelde dat ik moeder was zei hij ik vind je leuk maar een relatie zit er niet in tja je marktwaarde neemt toch af als je kinderen hebt dat merkte ik ook op internet waar ik een paar jaar geleden op een datingsite stond kreeg ik reacties in de trant van leuke meid jammer dat je kinderen hebt in het begin deed dat zeer dan dacht ik ik ben toch niet ineens minder leuk omdat ik moeder ben
9118620 de leuke mannen zijn vaak al bezet ik heb via internet wel een aantal relaties gehad maar die waren van korte duur e n man bleek zelfs getrouwd te zijn ik ben niet op zoek naar scharrels ik wil iets duurzaams en tja ook ik heb een druk leven ik doe allerlei cursussen zit in een sambaband heb een baan ga met vrienden naar de film die man moet gewoon op mijn pad komen je moet niet gaan jagen al zal ik niet ontkennen dat meedoen aan dit programma best handig is
9118621 mijn vader zou heel blij zijn als ik voor een praktische man ga dan hoeft hij eindelijk niet meer bij zijn dochter in huis te klussen
9118622 de mannen die aan het programma meedoen zijn in ieder geval erg romantisch ik heb van een van hen dit kettinkje gekregen
9118623 ik heb een parfum gekregen werd helemaal rood toen ik het uitpakte veel te gek toch
9118624 ik ben niet zo veeleisend ik zoek gewoon een man die weet wat hij wil en goed in zijn vel zit hij hoeft niet rijk en ambitieus te zijn ook qua uiterlijk heb ik geen eisenlijst het is een leuke bijkomstigheid als hij gespierd is maar dat is absoluut geen must
9118625 ik vind uiterlijk wel belangrijk dont judge a book by its cover zeggen ze maar een boek moet wel uitnodigend zijn om te gaan lezen een man moet zich gewoon goed verzorgen nadenken over zijn kapsel en kleding zelf ben ik vrij punctueel om niet te zeggen perfectionistisch dus ik val absoluut niet op slordig of mannen die te laat komen
9118626 ik vind betrouwbaarheid heel belangrijk met de mannen van het tv programma heb ik het onderwerp monogamie al een paar keer aangesneden maar veel tekst hadden ze niet alsof het onderwerp iets te gevoelig lag ze praatten er gewoon overheen viel me op zo van iemand nog koffie
9118627 ach die beesten zijn banger voor mij dan ik voor hen
9118628 maar sommige wetten der natuur zijn nu eenmaal niet te tarten zelfs niet door het dragen van verhullende kleding voor ze het weet heeft hij haar over zijn schouder geslingerd zal ze hem ooit duidelijk kunnen maken dat ze m r wil dan alleen een wilde vrijpartij
9118629 verloor win zijn zelfbeheersing en bewoog in en uit haar met harde besliste bewegingen
9118630 win wist dat ze van hem verwachtte dat hij zou aangeven waar hun relatie lag op het continu m van een one night stand tot een huwelijk

9118632 theolbroad i sort of needed to wash my eyes out with bleach after seeing it and my brain too
9118633 the situation has still not really completely normalised and what you have seen is the effects of it start to seep through to all different sectors of the economy clearly the financial system is fundamental to the functioning of the market economy and as funds drying up have had an impact on firms there has also been a very great impact on consumers
9118634 misrepresented both the writings of st augustine and the settled doctrine of the catholic church in an attempt to justify uncertainty about when human life begins and thus to defend a right to abortion
9118635 that in an age that prides itself on scientific knowledge there are those whose agenda drives them to invoke misinformed theology to cast doubt on some of the most basic biological truths
9118636 on behalf of the 650 000 catholics of this archdiocese i wish to reinforce what cardinal rigali bishop lori of bridgeport conn and archbishop chaput of denver have said about speaker pelosis misinterpretation on the question of when life begins
9118637 the church has taught for centuries that life begins at conception and there is no room for misrepresentation of that teaching in addition modern medical techniques have been able to confirm what the church has already known
9118638 the teachings were just so profound and so true and i could relate to what they were talking about
9118639 what i found about buddhism is its really good advice
9118640 i can see the value in it if it didnt work i wouldnt pursue it
9118641 theres always times in your life when things happen and its not so stable and i think it buddhism makes it easier to deal with anger and things like that
9118642 is dat zo dan moeten we er maar een heel bijzonder gesprek van maken h
9118643 natuurlijk besef ik dat de meeste vrouwen beginnen spontaan te giechelen als ik iets tegen hen zeg maar als je me vraagt of ik daar ook speciale moeite voor doe dan moet ik nee antwoorden ik doe me niet beter voor dan ik ben ik ben gewoon patrick dat imago heb ik natuurlijk aan mijn rol van derek shepherd in greys anatomy te danken maar ik kan je vertellen dat ik allesbehalve de ideale man ben mcdreamy is een mythe
9118644 ik ken ze niet in ieder geval mcdreamy is de belichaming van de man waar alle vrouwen van dromen de makers van de show hebben heel goed naar de dames geluisterd en zo het karakter van dokter shepherd gevormd ik heb gehoord dat vrouwen tijdens greys anatomy tegen hun man zeggen waarom kun jij niet zijn zoals hij en waarom zeg jij nooit zulke romantische dingen zelfs mijn eigen vrouw zegt dat tegen mij haha
9118645 gelukkig niet mijn vrouw jillian is de meest nuchtere in onze relatie ze is zelfverzekerd over wie ze is en zegt altijd als je beter kunt krijgen dan moet je meteen gaan ze weet dat ik haar aanbid en nooit onzorgvuldig met onze relatie zal omspringen ik heb ontzettend veel bewondering voor haar want ik weet n ding zeker ik zou gek worden van jaloezie als zij zoveel aandacht kreeg van mannen
9118646 dan komt ze vast aanzetten met een lijst van drie kantjes ik werk te hard ik wil altijd gelijk hebben maar heb het nooit ik ben ontzettend eigenwijs en nee ik heb niet het geduld dat mcdreamy met vrouwen heeft en toch blijft jillian bij me dat vind ik zo prachtig aan haar ze houdt van me ondanks mijn imperfecties
9118647 jazeker daar kom ik bij ons thuis echt niet onderuit
9118648 mijn gezin is mijn alles ik heb mijn hele carri re te danken aan jillian en mijn drie kinderen juist die basis heb je nodig om succesvol te zijn als acteur ik zou de ellenlange draaidagen en de enorme druk van hollywood niet aankunnen als ik hen niet had om aan het einde van de dag naar terug te keren zij zijn mijn rustpunt al is het in huize dempsey meestal allesbehalve rustig
9118649 ja als ik thuiskom heeft ieder zijn moment van aandacht nodig en die wil ik ze ook allemaal geven soms vergeet ik wel eens dat ik er zelf ook nog ben maar ach ik geniet er zo van om met de kinderen te spelen en te kijken naar hun slapstick acts
9118650 ik vind het verschrikkelijk en neem mijn familie daarom zo veel mogelijk mee als ik op reis ben kinderen groeien zo hard en ik wil achteraf geen spijt hebben dat ik de helft van hun opvoeding heb gemist mijn tweelingzoontjes beginnen nu aardig te lopen en te praten en als ik s avonds uit mijn werk kom heb ik het idee dat ze elke keer weer iets nieuws hebben geleerd
9118651 ik denk echt dat het de moeilijkste taak is die je kunt hebben in het leven het eerste jaar is lastig de achttien daaropvolgende een regelrecht drama ik denk dat iedere ouder wel eens onzeker is en denkt doe ik het wel goed gelukkig heb ik iemand naast me op wie ik honderd procent kan vertrouwen
9118652 van kleins af aan ben ik verliefd op itali mijn opa was in de jaren zestig wethouder van zuidlaren en ontmoette tijdens een van zijn projecten een italiaanse marmerhandelaar ze raakten bevriend en besloten samen een huis te bouwen in het noord italiaanse lestans zon tien kilometer van provesano waar pim fortuyn nu begraven ligt elk jaar gingen we daar met de hele familie op vakantie ik vond het er heerlijk het buitenleven de mensen het eten ik voelde me als een vis in het water en dat is altijd zo gebleven we zijn inmiddels goed bevriend geraakt met de buren van wie we vers fruit krijgen en eieren en natuurlijk zelfgestookte grappa jakkes toen ik 29 was begon het te kriebelen ik werkte vier jaar als trajectbegeleider in het asielzoekerscentrum in winschoten maar door alle bezuinigingen werd het werk er niet echt leuker op wat wil ik nou met mijn leven vroeg ik me af als ik iets anders wilde moest ik het n doen ik was nog jong had geen vaste relatie geen kinderen en eigenlijk had ik er altijd van gedroomd om naar het buitenland te vertrekken na een paar weken dubben hakte ik de knoop door ik ga naar itali

9118654 the department of state is extremely sensitive to your concerns and we are cognisant of the human rights abuses modi has committed
9118655 we have thoroughly searched department records and located no current non immigrant visa applications for modi however should we receive an application we assure you it will be adjudicated in strict accordance with the immigration and naturalisation act
9118656 the current response from the state department has virtually made narendra modi a persona non grata to the us
9118657 by persistently inviting the most notorious human rights abuser in india and propping narendra modi as their icon and hero the organisers of the world gujarati conference have brought shame to the indian american community and have tarnished the name of india
9118658 yeah i dont know why anyone would keep one of these for a pet look at them theyre gross and mean
9118659 well to each his own but not everyone thinks theyre ugly and theyre not mean
9118660 that it when life begins shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
9118661 misrepresented both the writings of st augustine and the settled doctrine of the catholic church in an attempt to justify uncertainty about when human life begins and thus to defend a right to abortion
9118662 that in an age that prides itself on scientific knowledge there are those whose agenda drives them to invoke misinformed theology to cast doubt on some of the most basic biological truths
9118663 in such a politicized environment of self serving skepticism and slogans about choice the church must tirelessly proclaim the truth about the dignity of the human person from conception to natural death this is all the more urgent when innocent human life is threatened as it is by abortion as well as embryonic stem cell research and euthanasia
9118664 on behalf of the 650 000 catholics of this archdiocese i wish to reinforce what cardinal rigali bishop lori of bridgeport conn and archbishop chaput of denver have said about speaker pelosis misinterpretation on the question of when life begins
9118665 the church has taught for centuries that life begins at conception and there is no room for misrepresentation of that teaching in addition modern medical techniques have been able to confirm what the church has already known
9118666 surely there may be some catholic politicians who will take a different interpretation of this church doctrine during the coming election campaign but speaker pelosis remarks underscore once again the need for catholics and especially catholic politicians to form their consciences according to the moral truths taught by the catholic church
9118667 be providing leadership in a civilized democracy worthy of the name
9118668 rectify your errant claims and apologize for misrepresenting the churchs doctrine and misleading fellow catholics
9118669 we wish you would have made a more honest effort to lay out the authentic position of the church on this core moral issue before attempting to address it with authority
9118670 your subsequent remarks mangle catholic church doctrine regarding the inherent sanctity and dignity of human life therefore we are compelled to refute your error

9118674 i thought after the first 10 minutes we settled in and played a good half
9118675 we moved the ball well we were crisp in our passing and we were the more aggressive team we just couldnt score
9118676 in the second half we broke down and couldnt find a rhythm
9118677 we went to three in the back trying to tie up the game and allowed three more goals
9118678 we took a risk and paid the price we havent trained in that formation at all this year but we gained valuable experience by playing it tonight and i think that will help us down the road arizona is a very good team and we just have to keep learning
9118679 and i thought im pretty stressed out so i knocked on the door
9118680 if that doesnt work for you you probably arent going to hang around for long
9118681 there are pictures of him at nuremberg sitting alongside heinrich himmler and hermann goering scribbling notes with his head down
9118682 id hear people refer to the center as the zen medication center
9118683 he always believed he would be reborn in a chinese houseboat
9118684 dont count on things to make you happy count on yourself
9118685 he wanted to spend time with buddhist monks and share experiences of monastic life
9118686 in the seminary we spent a lot of time studying moral and dogmatic theology but we spent more time learning how to keep the parish books than we did on mystical theology
9118687 so my strong awareness of my future death generated great fear fear and frustration because if one is fearful of death suicide is not an option i was in an existential dilemma both life and death were racked by anxiety and i saw no escape life seemed to be a cruel joke
9118688 i was a little leery of joining anything that might be a cult
9118689 but i kept coming back i read roshi kapleaus book and i thought this is really hard but i plowed through it and realized this is a really serious treatment
9118690 you sit there and you dont move thats part of the practice you learn to control your mind as well as your body a lot of it is learning to contend with distractions sleepiness annoyances cramps itches you sit through them they come and they go you learn to go into the pain and be there with it
9118691 its gradual the hard work is seeing things as they are and not having them clouded by ego and other distortions buddhism offers us a better view of life as it is i hope im a little more patient more tolerant
9118692 the kind of all pervasive suffering you cannot fix knowing there is going to be war and torture and people not caring for the planet
9118693 ive been a social activist my whole life since i first learned about suffering i tried many things i became part of a womens circle and we met once a week for a while and developed our own services
9118694 i left crying it was so wonderful to find a tradition that love is so central to
9118695 you cant just read the cookbook you have to taste the food
9118696 its so relaxing to not have this stream of thoughts rushing by
9118697 has always adapted to every culture it has spread to
9118698 the fact that we meet on sunday mornings is an american adaptation
9118699 we do not observe many of the tibetan holy days
9118700 we just have to be careful not to throw out the baby with the bath water
9118701 we have full recognition of the equality of men and women
9118702 i love the community service that catholic and protestant churches engage in
9118703 they had liturgies and hymns and called their teachers ministers
9118704 we are here because we want respect from the government
9118705 thats why weve massed in front of city hall to oppose the oppressive measures adopted by the government which effect not just buddhists but other minority religious groups as well
9118706 most of the high level appointments lee made were people from his church
9118707 the church is very special because of its ley lines i think something like the retreat should be there instead of what is planned to go there
9118708 our project will benefit the whole area by treating many people for stress pain and addiction
9118709 the st michael project seems more interested in these spiritual ley lines than the religious aspect of the church
9118710 and he swears he wasnt the one to do it
9118711 gustav hits caymans on track for western cuba us gulf
9118712 rumah ini milik abdul qodir jaelani tidak ada satu iblis pun boleh merampas

9118715 our goal is to better serve our south florida audiences while protecting the individual brands and identities of our respective newspapers
9118716 driving with a blood alcohol concentration of 08 or higher is illegal in every state yet we continue to see far too many people suffer debilitating injuries and loss of life as a result of impaired driving
9118717 this careless disregard for human safety must stop to help ensure that happens florida and georgias law enforcement agencies are dedicated to arresting impaired drivers wherever and whenever they find them
9118718 the florida highway patrol works very hard to keep our highways safe but we need drivers to do their part too especially when inclement weather affects driving conditions
9118719 ipsos reid also asked canadians if the government of prime minister stephen harper deserves to be re elected while a majority 48 per cent said no a significant number 44 per cent said it did
9118720 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
9118721 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
9118722 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
9118723 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
9118724 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
9118725 so with her weve got drilling babies guns and jesus hot damn
9118726 how the hell could you not have seen them whats wrong with you
9118727 2 5 on the scale will sometimes enjoy a quiet evening at home with a book or video but generally they flow to activities that place them in the company with many people
9118728 consumers pulled back on real spending in both june and july in the face of weak employment conditions higher energy prices and further declines in household net worth

9118733 as with any injury well see how it heals but we dont anticipate him missing any games
9118734 weve seen some teams do the things they do on offense but not with the talent they have and with the experience
9118735 if you look back theyve gone on the road and played big games and won so we are going to have play at a high level and put it together in a hurry if we want to be successful
9118736 they spread you out they make you defend the entire field and they dont try to run you over it is all about matchups
9118737 so it is hard to put pressure on their passer and it is hard to focus on stopping the run because they dont allow you to get into a rhythm from a defensive standpoint
9118738 we know it is a big season we know what we have to do
9118739 we cant keep talking about doing it we must go out and do it and we know it wont be easy particularly because bowling green is an excellent team we all know that but we havent really proven anything yet and we havent really done anything to earn our accolades but now we have to go out and do it
9118740 he roper did great things in our bowl game so im really excited to see if he can continue that kind of development
9118741 it helps us a little bit we know what to watch on film we know who to watch on film we can key his tendencies his releases and who his main receiver is
9118742 it helps us out hopefully it will work out on saturday
9118743 by al asr that is the ages during which the deeds both good and bad of the sons of dam alayhis sal m take place all h swears by time that man is in khusr which means in loss and destruction except those who believe and do righteous good deeds so all h makes an exception among the species of man being in loss for those who believe in their hearts and work righteous deeds with their limbs and recommend one another to the truth this is to perform acts of obedience and avoid the forbidden things and recommend one another to patience meaning with the plots the evils and the harms of those who harm people due to their commanding them to do good and forbidding them from evil
9118744 i saw those people the salaf and how they were more careful about their time than about their dirhams and din rs i

9118747 we have been looking to add a pinot noir vineyard for several years but hadnt found the ideal spot until now
9118748 and as new zealand is considered the most remote developed country in the world weve quite literally gone to the ends of the earth to try to produce the finest pinot imaginable

9118794 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
9118795 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
9118796 the reality is and i dont want to diminish this the industry is going to have to cover its costs
9118797 if there are fewer flights that wont bother me but if flights are really expensive i just wont go or ill go by myself instead of bringing my son and husband
9118798 and then youre good to go you dont have to worry about that
9118799 a very very small number of people would have purchased tickets for travel in september or thereafter before the flights were taken out of the fall schedule in may and june of this year
9118800 i think if oil prices continue to go down you will hear calls for relaxation of fuel surcharges but that doesnt mean they wont hike base airfares
9118801 i dont think most people in every aspect of their trip will notice a difference
9118802 if there is a silver lining it may be that as a result of fewer overall operations they may see better on time performance

9118811 q today many evangelicals are fascinated with the end of the world
9118812 a i write a good bit about this in the book and on the tour one of my talks will be devoted to this subject i think this is an incredibly important subject what a lot of well meaning committed evangelical christians dont realize is that the view of the end times that they believe is biblical and the historic christian view is actually a newcomer and an anomaly in christian history that view of the end times was never ever thought of in christian history until the 1830s now that doesnt make it wrong but it does make it suspect
9118813 are any of you familiar with the shift in scholarly thought away from a darby or a schofield view of eschatology
9118814 another interesting point to note is that when we read these verses and we see words like
9118815 homelessness its too big to be fixed poverty not out of my pocket deforestation endangered species animal abuse these things are too trivial to let them stand in the way of human rights not that were going to do anything about those either
9118816 theyre just trying to take on too much they cant fix the world
9118817 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing

9118824 we are constantly working to optimize and tweak the network to meet user needs and adding coverage wherever we can
9118825 is it the iphone device itself or on the at amp t network at amp t has many phones on the network without this problem so that leads us to believe the problem is on the iphone
9118826 during the first week or two there were several updates which fixed some initial problems since then my phone works without problem

9118831 we dont want to try to emulate beijing what we want is new ways of thinking about the opening ceremony
9118832 we want the whole of london to be involved with different parts of london taking part in the ceremony the london games must be deeply democratic with the citys citizens feeling theyre intimately involved
9118833 i think what you will see is a very vivid sense of celebration right across the city at both the opening and closing ceremonies
9118834 in terms of great organisation fantastic facilities and a welcoming attitude and pride among the people beijing was superb but there are things we can and will do better
9118835 i saw lots and lots of chinese people standing outside stadiums on the wrong part of a perimeter fence as observers rather than participants we must reverse that trend and make sure our olympics are more accessible
9118836 i also want to minimise the number of empty seats in stadiums which frustrate the public and keep them at a distance for no reason
9118837 the film is meant to alert yemeni youth against al qaeda group and to show that islam does not promote violence

9118853 were making a concerted effort to get the word out about what were looking for
9118854 id love it if massachusetts based companies had the technologies and expertise were looking for but we cant guarantee it
9118855 at this time im not overly concerned because we have to wait and see if the signatures are authentic
9118856 im confident we can beat it if it goes to the ballot if this issue goes to the ballot its really a waste of the citys resources money that could be better spent on core services that positively impact residents

9118883 ive been at a lot of different places and been underdogs in a lot of different games
9118884 you go into each game coaching just as hard and preaching to your players hey youve got a chance
9118885 what would happen i dont know im sure in some ways good things would come from it but id rather not learn lessons that way
9118886 i expect our guys to go down there and block tackle and not jump offsides and do the fundamental things that a good football team does
9118887 who we are playing doesnt have anything to do with us taking care of the football on saturday
9118888 any team can win on any day that was proven last year
9118889 if we come out and were lollygagging and everybodys kind of like usc usc thats whats going to happen were going to have a michigan appalachian state
9118890 if anything they the penguins have an advantage because if anything is going to happen were going to sleep on them which i dont think is going to happen again everybody refers back to appalachian state and its a valid point
9118891 you cannot chase ghosts while preparing for a football game
9118892 it was awesome ive got the best team in the world
9118893 i mean ive never been on the football team before im a soccer player they love me theyve taken me in as one of their own im feeling on top of the world
9118894 this is one of those games you hate to lose neither team deserved to lose but we did tonight so well take that and well come back next week and hopefully play better
9118895 even going through pee wee and all the way up everybody on special teams did a good job blocking the holes were there i just made some cuts and scored the touchdowns
9118896 this year its evan bach hes the one that whether were throwing the ball he can run it he can catch it he plays tailback he plays wide receiver hes the punt returner hes the kickoff returner and he starts on defense he doesnt come off the field thats one thing you dont really notice he doesnt come off the field
9118897 we ran 11 offensive plays in the first half and scored 35 points
9118898 the efficiency was evan bach running back a kickoff and a punt
9118899 were not just one guy beers is our main guy but we have two quarterbacks who can get the job done weve got wide receivers weve got probably four or five running backs who can get stuff done we did about what we wanted to do
9118900 blessed are the peacemakers war rages torture continues governments hack their citizens to bits with machetes women are raped whole towns are slaughtered by children with machine guns we are all one we all share each others pain why cant we all dance together brilliant work
9118901 we hurt ourselves a lot and central did some nice things against us but our kids fought hard
9118902 you tell them when they do something wrong or something doesnt go their way you have to forget about it and play that next play thats hard to do as players or coaches
9118903 but we did that for the most part and we responded at halftime theres obviously some things we have to fix we just cant have penalties like we did tonight but our kids came through
9118904 i thought we played pretty good in the first half but we sure couldnt buy a break
9118905 i think they started to wear us down in the second half we had to really have a big push to be successful here to tonight and i thought we played a pretty good first half if we wouldve had a few breaks here or there who knows but every break went against us
9118906 the second half i think we were just worn down and we really had nothing going for us offensively we have to get to where we can throw the football effectively we just cant throw the ball very well right now
9118907 we put a goose egg up there and thats great for our defense
9118908 defensively we were methodical and reactive on offense in the second half i thought we controlled the game and moved the ball well but we were slow to get shots off and a bit chaotic in the final third of the half
9118909 we didnt capitalize on their mistakes in the first half and their goalkeeper nicole lograsso came up big in the second half
9118910 can u go over to the other side and play we are training
9118911 we are training why cant u go to the other side

9118917 for the security and non diversion of marijuana grown for medical use
9118918 california voters approved an initiative legalizing medical marijuana prop 215 in 1996 not street drugs
9118919 marijuana intended for medicinal use should not be sold to non patients or on illicit markets
9118920 such entities cannot be operated for profit may not purchase marijuana from unlawful sources and must have a defined organizational structure that includes detailed records proving that users are legitimate patients
9118921 until the threat of federal prosecution of growers is eliminated providers are obliged to take steps to safeguard the privacy of suppliers
9118922 it would appear to remain within the power of local communities to permit medical marijuana smoking wherever they choose

9118963 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9118964 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9118965 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9118966 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9118967 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9118968 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9118969 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9118970 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9118971 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9118972 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9118973 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9118974 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9118975 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9118976 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9118977 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9118978 nueva promocion 100 discreta que te dara la maxima satisfaccion ranita mamadora version 2 0 solo 10 dolares
9118979 mira ranita lo primero que hay que hacer es dorar la cebolla a fuego bajo con un poquito de aceite si es de oliva mejor luego cortas los tomates en cuadraditos y los echas
9118980 vos mejor callate y anda preparando la valija que si esta ranita aprende a cocinar te pego una patada en el orto
9118981 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9118982 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9118983 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9118984 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9118985 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9118986 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9118987 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9118988 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9118989 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9118990 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9118991 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9118992 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9118993 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9118994 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9118995 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9118996 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9118997 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9118998 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9118999 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9119000 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9119001 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9119002 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9119003 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9119004 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9119005 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9119006 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9119007 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9119008 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9119009 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9119010 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9119011 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9119012 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9119013 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9119014 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9119015 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9119016 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9119017 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9119018 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9119019 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9119020 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9119021 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9119022 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9119023 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9119024 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9119025 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9119026 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9119027 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9119028 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9119029 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9119030 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9119031 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9119032 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9119033 the nokia n96 builds upon this tradition to bring mobility to todays most valuable internet services
9119034 with support for movies music games navigation and more right out of the box the real power of the nokia n96 is that it provides an open application environment for users to define their own mobile lifestyle
9119035 the number you have dialed my nuanced protected victim class status is no longer in service and there is no new number
9119036 its an incredible time to be around i wish my momma could have seen this day
9119037 just seeing him on stage i cried my eyelashes off
9119038 ive never experienced anything like this i think that what he had to offer the country tonight will make us all better
9119039 an african american candidate talking about economics and a white war hero its clear to me who is going to win
9119040 hey we told you there were multiple sessions logged on to your account
9119041 they can close that street off if they want ive seen it done time and again in other cities
9119042 they truly are experiencing a tremendous increase in traffic flow right now
9119043 this was determined by the board to be the best course of action
9119044 hes qualified and we had a need to fill its a good fit for everybody
9119045 ive had a number of jobs with the school district
9119046 we are starting to feel the impact of the national economic situation
9119047 what are the things we can do more to control our destiny
9119048 addressing the problem of violent crime in the community requires a holistic approach
9119049 these homicides are a tragic symptom of the long term disinvestment in the urban core addressing them is a moral imperative
9119050 were trying to get out ahead of the curve months in advance of the cold weather and alert missourians to the challenges we all face with energy costs
9119051 the grants to low income missourians help them improve their homes so they dont need public assistance going forward
9119052 sun has included changes that perform additional hostname matching using dns reverse mapping data to mitigate these issues
9119053 we dont like what youre saying so were gonna shut you do
9119054 if you dont bring your notebook pencil and book to class you will get a zero for that day
9119055 we cant keep having people running back to their lockers during class
9119056 what the studies are showing is that your first year is very very difficult no matter how you come
9119057 thoughtful and rigorous debate might be the ultimate moral act
9119058 we are attempting to prove deliberation in a way that hasnt been tried in this state
9119059 but at the end of the day another court is going to have to make that decision
9119060 this was a case that haunted people in jackson county
9119061 there are people who want blood its going to be controversial
9119062 there have been very few cases in our history that have touched our community so deeply
9119063 when i was in high school he was one of the first musicians i got into i like to get into music history so ive done a lot of reading about parker every year i gain a better appreciation of him im beginning to love his music even more
9119064 hes such an integral part of the history of jazz and saxophone hes contributed so much to the music you study birds music and everything is there he wrote some of the best hes one of the most amazing improvisers of all time someone with that kind of mastery of the music will never be forgotten thats why bird lives on today
9119065 we spent a lot of time together there was no other like him
9119066 the only song i know on piano he taught me
9119067 we learned to smoke together and drink together it got to be where he was at my home all the time we just had fun he was a jovial person at all times
9119068 even if just a little bit of that has rubbed off on me thats a high honor its something im very proud of
9119069 people come from all over the world to cash money out of this
9119070 they have so many resources if you just take away the negative publicity they need real guidance dont leave them alone but dont bash them all the time let the government and others take care of the people theres a lot of potential in that country

9119079 but i have been thinking of a young dynamic duo of up and comers that might just launch the whole
9119080 so far the best app ive found to snap pictures and automatically upload them to my flickr stream
9119081 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
9119082 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
9119083 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
9119084 id rather slit a vein than vote for john mccain
9119085 the last time he left a lot of pitches up today he threw more strikes we just hit his mistakes when he made some
9119086 the first pitch to encarnacion wasnt a bad pitch a changeup that was kind of flat
9119087 because i dont think i have led the company as often as a company best should be
9119088 well have any other people from other platoons led us before
9119089 so what do you actually want to achieve in this bmt
9119090 you see shukri if you go on like this youll just fail the interview youre not confident of yourself you know sometimes i think humble people are very stupid they give away opportunities
9119091 reforming admissions policies would be a good place to start in stopping discrimination
9119092 there are faith schools that are 90 or even 100 funded by the tax payer and yet they only cater or prioritise 5 of the population often faith schools take pupils only from their own faith or even from their own denomination within a faith
9119093 90 of the population have been ruled out straight away
9119094 if they can actually recruit from 100 rather than 10 of those available they will get a better calibre of teacher
9119095 all the kids played really hard for their new coach
9119096 i was here the first time we were 1 0 but we didnt play a team
9119097 we just put three big guys in the middle and figured thered be a qb sneak
9119098 what it comes down to is the offensive line they gave me plenty of time
9119099 but theyre a good team their coaching staff called a great game
9119100 weve practiced that play since the beginning of the summer
9119101 ive got to give it up to them my o line did a great job tonight
9119102 i dont believe anyone in the life movement would pick a pro abortion candidate especially announcing them in southwest ohio
9119103 i think its important to stay on message and discuss her experience as an elected official and her personal life
9119104 his choice of the governor of alaska is absolutely a home run and i think it will certainly energize the troops
9119105 we were hoping for a good strong conservative pro life candidate and i think that mr mccain hit a homerun with his choice
9119106 we started screaming in the car we were so excited
9119107 i left my pawlenty signs in the car its even better than pawlenty i would have been happy with pawlenty but its even better than him
9119108 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals
9119109 we make a couple of good plays and then we do something unbecoming of the team
9119110 right now as a team we dont trust each other we lack consistency the interceptions just killed us
9119111 hey thats not our phone number our phone number is
9119112 i wish i could be the fly on the wall in that house
9119113 bertadharru meratap kepada allah agar segala kesusahan kedlaliman dan diskriminasi dijauhkan dari kita
9119114 bulan ramadhan merupakan bulan dimana diturunkan di dalamnya untuk menjadi petunjuk bagi manusia dan tanda tanda dari petunjuk dan pembeda dari yang benar dan batil
9119115 wahai orang orang yang beriman diwajibkan atasmu melaksanakan puasa sebagaimana yang diwajibkan atas kaum sebelummu agar kamu bertaqwa
9119116 dengan bertaqwa para kekasih allah bisa terlindungi dari perbuatan yang tercela dalam hatinya diliputi rasa takut kepada allah sehingga menyebabkannya senantiasa terjaga di malam hari untuk beribadah lebih suka menahan kesusahan dari pada mencari hiburan rela merasakan lapar dan haus merasa dekat dengan ajal sehingga mendorongnya untuk memperbanyak amal kebajikan
9119117 ketika datang malam pertama dari bulan ramadhan seluruh syaithan dibelenggu dan seluruh jin diikat
9119118 wahai orang yang mencari kebaikan kemarilah wahai orang yang mencari keburukan menyingkilah hanya allah lah yang bisa menyelamatkan dari api neraka
9119119 ketika telah masuk bulan ramadhan maka dibuka pintu pintu langit dan ditutup pintu pintu neraka jahannam dan dibeleggu semua syaithan
9119120 ketika telah tiba bulan ramadhan maka di bukakan pinti pintu sorga
9119121 barang siapa berpuasa di bulan suci itu dengan beriman dan mengharap pahala dari sisi allah maka diampuni segala dosa yang telah ia lakukan
9119122 orang orang memang punya ingatan pendek tetapi tidak pendek pendek amat namanya saja sudah mirip dengan korupsi
9119123 dia tidak pernah dianjurkan minum obat cukup konseling saya cukup lama menghabiskan waktu bersama dia selama dua tahun terakhir dia cukup waspada dan stabil
9119124 tak satu pun yang bebas dari kecurangan menurut saya ia lebih baik dibandingkan orang orang itu lagi pula dia kan suami benazir bhutto yang memimpikan pakistan makmur dia akan mewujudkan mimpi sang istri atau setidaknya dia akan berupaya
9119125 dia mungkin ahli dalam politik darwinian tetapi masyarakat melihat tidak adanya kualitas kepemimpinan

9119201 the bottom line was to have a player on your team to just play nickel he would have to be special

9119204 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9119205 it just felt normal just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole another on the second hole i kind of built on that momentum
9119206 a lot of guys on the sideline we wanted to get in the end zone bad but they play good defense
9119207 we dont want to throw an interception or things like that we reserve the right to kick you dont want to force something in there
9119208 theres no reason you cant give it a colts look where youve got witten in the slot like they do with dallas clark
9119209 not a lot but anybody who tells you they dont pay any attention is probably lying baseball america does a great job of being a tool of the game the astros minor league system was not as bad as portrayed
9119210 we dont have enough depth in the minor leagues to be able to go out there and make a blockbuster deal
9119211 milwaukee had the right pieces to make a sabathia deal
9119212 in the last two years we havent really signed a lot of the high draft picks
9119213 you cant get into specifics as far as dollar amounts
9119214 whats their desire to play pro ball or to go to college
9119215 our amateur scouts have clear guidelines before a player can make our draft board he must have signability the scouts have to get as much information as possible what are the players expectations
9119216 youve got to wait a long time to analyze a deal
9119217 the players weve acquired have done a great job you dont root against the players you traded
9119218 the astros seemed to go find the player they needed when they made deals
9119219 they got rid of three or four top players they had players to trade to get those guys obviously the farm system had to be in pretty good shape weve depleted that
9119220 it takes two to three years to see the impact of a good draft
9119221 youve got to be patient thats the biggest challenge for all of us it takes time the fans dont want to hear it the owners dont want to hear it you always want to shorten that development

9119240 hey tbone this is lisa gilpin from saturn you will not believe what i have here in front of me
9119241 theres not a whole lot we can do about it
9119242 its a grievance filed by the players association the commissioners office has to react the way they see fit they thought the best thing to do would be to not have eric play until the validity of his contract is looked at
9119243 we have asked the royals to not play eric hosmer until the situation regarding certain player signings has been resolved
9119244 is we agreed during the appropriate time frame and the terms were submitted in the appropriate time limit thats all i can say about it
9119245 i know eric hosmer is very pleased with his contract
9119246 its the first time in his career that hes ever gone through some tough times
9119247 he came out of it great hes ending on a high note
9119248 the team made the playoffs so hes going to get that added piece of development all in all it was a very positive year
9119249 not enough two out hits thats part of the issue we need more two out hits
9119250 we have to have to ability to stop the bleeding when the defense makes a mistake
9119251 i threw some really good pitches a bit unlucky a broken bat hit falls in a jammed shot falls in two seeing eye singles to the left side the curtis granderson one was hit well
9119252 the defense failed him a little bit but granderson hit the one mistake kyle did make
9119253 but the numbers hes put up against us this year i guess we should he doesnt throw overly hard he doesnt have really great stuff
9119254 maybe its a confidence thing he has against us hes a guy we need to get to we didnt do it
9119255 was marcus thames busting his tail to get to first without him running that hard the ball gets picked up and hes out it probably frustrated davies a little bit
9119256 the american red cross chose minot as one of its call centers because we dont have many disasters and because we have a good work ethic they know we will be here when there is a disaster
9119257 it can be as simple as coming in and routing messages or as involved as going to disaster places like katrina
9119258 during katrina someone from a rooftop was listening to the radio heard our number and called us we helped organize the coast guard rescue its kinda like being there
9119259 i dont trust anybody more than i trust him when it comes to stuff like that just to go down there and hear it from him its something i needed to do just to clear my mind
9119260 he said my ligament looked fine thats what i was afraid of it was a big relief
9119261 we saw the rally monkey come out and knew it was time
9119262 youre certainly dealing with the reality that theres no way were going to be able to catch the angels so we just want to win some ball games
9119263 its disheartening for everybody in the organization to not see the excitement of this team funnel its way into tropicana field
9119264 crowds under 16 000 making it five out of the last six
9119265 the tv ratings are high but it hasnt translated to the number of people at tropicana field it really takes the wind out of our sails
9119266 weve poured our hearts and souls into making this a great draw and a great fan experience and to come home after a great road trip and have the smallest crowds in major league baseball was discouraging
9119267 its discouraging to the players to come to the field all charged up and then see so few people in the seats star pitcher scott kazmir said
9119268 we were always told that once we started winning fans would come now what weve already heard every excuse
9119269 i beg to disagree with any candidate who would say we cant drill our way out of our problem
9119270 as recently as last year palin pronounced pale in was a political outcast she resigned in january 2004 as head of the alaska oil and gas conservation commission after complaining to the office of governor frank murkowski and to state attorney general gregg renkes about ethical violations by another commissioner randy ruedrich who was also republican state chairman

9119276 fear is the path to the dark side fear leads to anger anger leads to hate hate leads to suffering
9119277 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9119278 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate

9119312 he caught me playing tag while i swam my laps
9119313 ive always been taught to have a plan and stick to it
9119314 that it just feels normal and the rest of the other stuff will have to wait
9119315 i do have guys who can beat me in events and ians one of them
9119316 in every walk of life youve got your all time wonders and michael is our einstein our newton
9119317 what hes accomplished at 22 complete domination has never been done in our sport he has a chance before hes through to win 25 golds at the olympics i laughed out loud to watch him blow away the worlds
9119318 if michael stopped today hed go down in history as the greatest swimmer ever but theres a number of things he can i hope improve on
9119319 his freestyles gotten better and his breaststroke s still coming if he continues to work as hard as he has till now we might see drops in time still and they could be big ones
9119320 going from one field to another trying to dump energy out of my system so my mom could deal with me at home
9119321 hed seen me at the pool running around and being benched and said theres no way im training him
9119322 i had a mouth on me and my own way of doing things and i gave coach hell
9119323 he told us that michael was more than just fast he was a world class swimmer if he trained right
9119324 i was skeptical when bob laid the plan out to us
9119325 but michael heard olympics and his ears stood up till then i never knew it was something he wanted
9119326 he told me i wasnt going to get where i wanted by living a normal kid life
9119327 i had a tight clique of friends i grew up with from grade school and the more involved i got with swimming the less i got to see them theyre having parties on friday nights and ive got a 7 am workout saturday so im staying home playing video games while my boys are out having fun
9119328 it was a dumb thing to do a big mistake
9119329 i couldve hurt somebody and in a way i did i hurt my moms feelings and the people who care about me
9119330 if i want to leave a legacy behind for my sport
9119331 i want to change my sport push it up to the point where kids go out for swim team instead of jv hoops
9119332 i want it up at the level its at in australia where guys like ian thorpe are giant stars and people jam in to see their meets thats why i bust it so hard for 08 if i can do in beijing what i did in greece it might just help us put it over the top
9119333 i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the v p does every day

9119346 people are less willing or able to pay the high tuition costs at other colleges for the first two years of their bachelor degrees and they want professional or career training to get into the job market right away with skills in high demand fields
9119347 the community colleges have a much broader mission than just a generation ago for many students weve become an ideal solution for those looking to embark on their educational path at a college that offers affordable tuition small class sizes world class teaching and the ability to enter a profession or transfer to a four year institution
9119348 now they see us as a viable option when they consider higher education and training outside of the technical fields we have been known for
9119349 they come to check us out and find we can meet their needs for transferable degrees and professional training

9119368 the surge isnt going to work either tactically or strategically
9119369 his combination of size and athleticism is hard to find anywhere
9119370 we were able to physically compete in our second year and make the big east tournament but we couldnt score and we werent athletic enough to create offense
9119371 hes going to prove to the world how good he is
9119372 its been tough because weve lost a lot of kids
9119373 its hard to keep kids when you arent winning a lot of games
9119374 we lost what would have been our entire senior class for one reason or another
9119375 thats basically in our backyard the majority of our alumni lives in sioux falls and its essentially a home game for us
9119376 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
9119377 as far as i know we dont publish response and refusal rates we conducted the poll for the associated press youd have to ask them about releasing the response and refusal rates
9119378 we dont have them here from ipsos it takes a little while for them to get those to us i can ask them it shouldnt take too long but normally it takes a few days theyre not secret or anything
9119379 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
9119380 a reasonable approximation for the response rate on the economist wave of august 4 6 would be 43 the opt out rate from our mailings was 4 my best guess at a comparable statistic to refusal

9119382 hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan and they will be left in the city not out of choice but out of necessity

9119387 so they throw this asset away and send me home
9119388 but just as race isnt used as a proxy age shouldnt be either
9119389 im tired of old white men appointing women who arent qualified just because they think that will appease women it happens all the time in my business

9119444 wow thanks so much to this sarah palin who never forgot us she is a fighter she paid her respects to our hillary and geraldine they now no more think women in this country are 2nd class you go girl and thank you for a refreshing pick sen mccain
9119445 remember just a short while ago obama would not visit the wounded soldiers in germany
9119446 the toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
9119447 health inequity really is a matter of life and death
9119448 but health systems will not naturally gravitate towards equity unprecedented leadership is needed that compels all actors including those beyond the health sector to examine their impact on health primary health care which integrates health in all of governments policies is the best framework for doing so
9119449 central to the commissions recommendations is creating the conditions for people to be empowered to have freedom to lead flourishing lives nowhere is lack of empowerment more obvious than in the plight of women in many parts of the world health suffers as a result following our recommendations would dramatically improve the health and life chances of billions of people
9119450 water borne diseases are not caused by a lack of antibiotics but by dirty water and by the political social and economic forces that fail to make clean water available to all heart disease is caused not by a lack of coronary care units but by lives people lead which are shaped by the environments in which they live obesity is not caused by moral failure on the part of individuals but by the excess availability of high fat and high sugar foods
9119451 we rely too much on medical interventions as a way of increasing life expectancy
9119452 a more effective way of increasing life expectancy and improving health would be for every government policy and programme to be assessed for its impact on health and health equity to make health and health equity a marker for government performance
9119453 it is wonderful to have global endorsement of the australian closing the gap campaign from the csdh established by the who the csdh sets closing the gap as a goal for the whole world and produces the evidence on how health inequities are a reflection of the way we organize society and distribute power and resources the good news from the csdh for australia is that it provides plenty of ideas on how to set an agenda that will tackle the underlying determinants of health and create a healthier australia for all of us
9119454 canada likes to brag that for seven years in a row the united nations voted us
9119455 a fairer world will be a healthier world a health service and medical interventions are just one of the factors that influence population health the growth of inequalities and the phenomena of increased injustice in health is present in low and middle income countries as well as across europe it would be a crime not to take every action possible to reduce them
9119456 the report suggests avenues for action from the local to national and global levels it has been eagerly awaited by policy makers health officials grassroot activists and their community based organizations much of the research and evidence is of particular relevance to the south east asian region where too many people struggle daily for justice and equity in health the report will inspire the region to act and develop new policies and programmes
9119457 a man should not be concerned with whether he has enough possessions but whether possessions have been equally distributed
9119458 the who commission addresses one of the major issues of our global world health inequity the reports recommendations will be perceived utilized and implemented as a major policy agenda at national and global levels the issue will increase in importance as the general public become more engaged via civil society movements and multi stakeholder involvement
9119459 according to the islamic ideology social justice became a priority when the islamic revolution materialized in iran establishing a solid primary health care network in our country not only improved our health statistics but it was an excellent vehicle to move towards health equity now through the final report of the csdh and implementing its recommendations we need to move much faster in our own country toward health equity
9119460 the commission on social determinants of health report will help african leaders adapt their national development strategies to address the challenges to health these are derived from the current systemic changes taking place in the global economy that affects heavily on the poorest segments of africas population
9119461 the primary object of development for any country and for the world as a whole is the elimination of unfreedoms that reduce and impoverish the lives of people central to human deprivation is the failure of the capability to live long and healthy lives this is much more than a medical problem it relates to handicaps that have deep social roots under michael marmots leadership this who commission has concentrated on the badly neglected causal linkages that have to be adequately understood and remedied a fuller understanding is also a call for action
9119462 the united states of america spends more on health care than any other country in the world yet it ranks 41st in terms of life expectancy new orleans and its experience with hurricane katrina illustrate why we need to target social determinants of health sdh including housing education working and learning conditions and whether people are exposed to toxins better than any place i can think of right now by targeting the sdh we can rapidly move towards closing the gap that unfairly and avoidably separates the health status of groups of different socio economic status social exclusion experience and educational background
9119463 health delivery is not possible for people living in squalor in dehumanizing pathetic conditions prevailing in the ever growing slum settlements of cities and towns in developing countries investment in basic services such as water and education will always remain constrained if not wasted unless accompanied by requisite investment in decent housing with basic sanitation
9119464 professor of medical sociology director of chess centre for health equity studies in sweden member of the royal swedish academy of sciences and of its standing committee on health
9119465 what this report makes clear is that improving health and health outcomes and reducing avoidable health differences goals of all countries involves far more than just improving the health care system basic living conditions employment early childhood education treatment of women and poverty all impact on health outcomes and incorporating their effects on health outcomes needs to become an important part of public policymaking this is as true for wealthy countries like the united states as it is for many of the emerging countries of the world where large numbers of people live on less than 2 per day
9119466 weve played against a lot of teams that do that
9119467 its nerve racking at times but i have confidence in the team
9119468 they definitely cant be taken lightly itll be a good season opener for us
9119469 it takes a lot of repetitions to get it down like with most offenses
9119470 weve just got to wait and see theres a lot of anxiousness leading up to this game
9119471 were ready to get out there and see how we fare

9119474 were really about team goals everybodys just trying to play their roles
9119475 weve got some people who need to step up at a few spots

9119477 the appearance of john mccain and barack obama at saddleback californias purpose driven church marks the ultimate ascent of rick warren to the gantry in chief of the p t barnum church of america
9119478 a liberal as i never tire of quoting from robert frost is someone who would not take his own side in an argument
9119479 the dnc and the media can tell any lies they like but they cannot change the fact that the democratic presidential candidate hates whites including the members of his mothers family who showed him every kindness compared with the average self proclaimed white bigot who says he loves his ancestors obama is one sick and sorry excuse for a human being
9119480 obamas claim to be a christian is his best evidence that he was never a muslim
9119481 however you describe affirmative action and minority set asides they represent a deliberate and systematic policy of discrimination against people like me in favor of people not like me simply because they are not like me such disgusting and immoral policies are worse than any form of racism i have encountered because they teach us to hate precisely those whom we are most supposed to love
9119482 bigotry these days has nothing to do with the way you treat people or even with what you actually say bigotry is what they say you are thinking when the play your speech backward at half speed
9119483 w e should not make the mistake of blaming black people for the suicide we continue to inflict on ourselves
9119484 right now its a small group of what might be considered oddball turtles
9119485 but we have a lot to learn about them are they part of a more complex sea turtle migration dynamic than we ever imagined or just lost wanderers
9119486 i got a telephone call in 1988 from a jogger claiming to have witnessed a startling phenomenon
9119487 he said do you guys know there is a green sea turtle in the san gabriel river
9119488 i asked him if the turtle had claws on its feet
9119489 if the answer is yes which it almost always is its a freshwater turtle it saves me a trip
9119490 we used to think the san diego bay group was the northernmost foraging colony of green sea turtles
9119491 but it looks like the san gabriel river colony has us beat for that title
9119492 ive been waiting to do this since you were ten years old
9119493 i dont see mcmc as an independent body especially when they are acting in the interest of the government
9119494 it makes the ban seems suspicious and it makes malaysians more and more distrustful of those in power
9119495 i was shocked to hear them use invectives about the president
9119496 i want to thank the vice president once again for coming through for me
9119497 im surpised vice president quayle watches murphy brown isnt that on as the same time as f troop on nickelodeon
9119498 i never have really said much about the whole episode which was endless but his speech was a perfectly intelligent speech about fathers not being dispensable and nobody agreed with that more than i did
9119499 creating yet another sub set of justice for police runs the risk of yet again carving up access to justice in mexico making it less accessible for victims of abuses to reach an outcome based on what can be considered due process and equality before the law
9119500 it wouldnt be a way to provide impunity or protection to the police rather it would be a legal structure to contain it discipline it and to avoid excesses
9119501 getting the same staff to play different roles inside the pgr attorney generals office and the mp district attorneys office which is often the habit in law enforcement institutions in mexico shuffle around the same pack of cards yet not create anything new or truly independent
9119502 coincidentally the cndhs proposal appears to be ideal for the establishment of a special legal system for police such as the one advocated in the military generals proposal
9119503 this is a police force that has demonstrated its ineptness at carrying out civilian policing functions often spilling over into the excessive use of force for example in atenco and oaxaca

9119507 she spoke on radio programs all throughout the campaign saying i want a constitutional amendment i think these things are only for a man and a woman i dont think shes ever said a friendly word about gay people that they ought to have health benefits like other people do or anything along those lines
9119508 the police and the east coast community are extremely concerned about the sickening ordeal that the two victims have endured
9119509 we are urging anyone with information about the attack or anyone fitting this description to come forward in particular names of people fitting that description who were in the vicinity of the sports club or elsewhere in tokomaru bay that night
9119510 im very confident that there will be an absolute clearance for mr peters in a relatively short period of time
9119511 obviously they have to check the information we have given them we gave them copies of entries on the trust statement and they will check them out with the banks
9119512 i believe that eventually justice will triumph and that in this case there will be an absolute clearance and there will hopefully be apologies from all those who have been severely prejudicial and havent look at the facts
9119513 we have been looking to add a pinot noir vineyard for several years but hadnt found the ideal spot until now
9119514 and as new zealand is considered the most remote developed country in the world weve quite literally gone to the ends of the earth to try to produce the finest pinot imaginable
9119515 shes going to bring to the republicans what choosing hillary as vp would have brought to the democrats

9119791 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9119792 it wasnt a georgian attack on tskhinvali that launched all of this
9119793 it was russian pressure over a long period of time and then shelling coming from south ossetians
9119794 was not a wise thing to do because as weve seen russia was prepared to launch a major invasion
9119795 today it is a fight between the civilized and the uncivilized worlds

9119825 obviously im not going to abuse him hopefully there are days where we score a lot of runs and dont have to use him but the last two days weve had to use him a lot you dont want to do it for a long time but the one thing is were being smart about the way we use him
9119826 the thing is he doesnt throw a lot of pitches and that helps the situation

9119829 the decision was taken after a meeting of the departmental promotion committee on friday
9119830 after a gap of one year the fourth edition of nihilanth will be happening in iit bombay last year we missed out on the event as there was a debate over the venue 2008 also happens to be our golden jubilee year we are therefore uniquely positioned to conduct the event on a scale never seen before
9119831 in the past editions of the festival the iims have taken away all the prizes but this year on the eve of our golden jubilee celebrations iit b would like to make a mark
9119832 this seamless convergence of conventional and distance education components in the programme will go a long way for the efficient programme delivery
9119833 it is our responsibility to make sure that we serve only naturally grown and safe rice
9119834 the bistro group recognizes the importance of protecting the countrys rice supply from gmo contamination and is proud to be the first to sign onto such a project led by greenpeace
9119835 the campaign also serves to assure consumers that the rice they are eating is free from these risky organisms which pose serious threats to biodiversity farmers livelihoods and human health
9119836 this is one of the dangers of gmos they are living organisms and can easily escape test fields field trials and enter the food chain without the knowledge of the developers
9119837 our rice is being threatened by contamination but we have so far successfully prevented any gmo rice from being approved in the philippines through an injunction
9119838 a month or so ago we approached greenpeace because we wanted to go green as a company we wanted to do our part in this global campaign which is going green but we didnt really know how to go about it
9119839 going green is a complicated issue not many people would understand in fact some guests would say does that mean you are introducing more salads on your menu
9119840 the philippines needs to develop a national program that will not only invite filipinos abroad to come home occasionally and render a few medical missions but to entice them to stay on and actually work in the country
9119841 hybrid models that shift from gasoline fuel to electric power at the touch of a button
9119842 we should remember the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain is a minority versus majority issue and if it would always be the tyranny of the majority that would be imposed the aspirations of the minority would never be realized
9119843 i would press the government not to continue the fighting even especially at the ramadan time
9119844 we offer this prayer as one nation and in solidarity with the mindanao bishops as well as the thousands of innocent people who are forced to evacuate and live in uncertainty and fear because of the current crisis and war
9119845 to use ramadan to escape or avoid facing the consequence of the law
9119846 there is going to be no let up in hunting down those who have to face the consequence of the law but the forces on the ground will definitely exercise great sensitivity to the observance of ramadan the government will not allow those who are object of this manhunt to hide behind ramadan to escape liability before the law
9119847 just have a little cake with my children and watch some cartoons
9119848 very wise and sage but at the same time very young
9119849 it is not an indication of any health problems it is an effort to be unseen
9119850 no one is planning anything special he is just being quiet these days
9119851 i dont think our celebrities are real hot on how old they are getting why would a pop singer draw attention to the fact they are getting older
9119852 to really still be in the conversation in terms of music sales decades after your career started is the exception not the norm
9119853 it is hard to imagine any album ever dominating the conversation as much as thriller did

9119857 i thought the timing of the goal was really the critical factor in tonights game
9119858 to give up a goal so early in each half had a big influence on the match i thought the lads battled and worked hard i thought we could have been in the match the timing of goals is critical in the game of soccer and tonight they came at very bad moments
9119859 i thought parker duncan caused them a lot of problems in the first half up front
9119860 i also think that rory oconnor really played a solid game for us on the defensive end
9119861 most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and the right place theyre capable of anything
9119862 its certainly not the best way to do your first dry laps on a new city street circuit in qualifying but our car was also not so good we have a lot to do before the race the track is just very bumpy
9119863 this was a day to forget with very difficult conditions we had no time to work out a reasonable setup it will be a tough race for us but we will try to find something in the warm up then lets see what happens in the race
9119864 i could not do so many laps and always under different conditions
9119865 if you have to pick the worst conditions for our r10 tdi you cant chose a better day than this one we like straights smooth tracks and a lot of grip here we have tight corners lots of bumps and no grip at all because its been raining a lot on this kind of tracks we need to quite a lot of set up work to optimize the car this was not the case because of the rain we did what we could in qualifying tomorrow is another day we showed many times that race day is really a different day for the audis we can only benefit from the track getting more rubber
9119866 it was a very difficult day there was no time to make a proper set up and no time to get the drivers accustomed i think there is still a lot more in the car
9119867 donne moi lol si je te donne tu as pas les tune pour mappeller car fran ais trop povres come leur imaginations et bientot la culture car napol on cest finit

9119872 the easy money from the texas lottery has already been made growth will not be easy from here on out
9119873 high gasoline prices are having a devastating effect on all kinds of gambling in the u s
9119874 the production operation and development of the company will face challenges mainly due to the great cost pressure driven by high prices of mineral resources coal electricity oil and other energy sources as well as transportation cost
9119875 the fierce competition in domestic mineral resources and non ferrous metals market are bringing difficulties for production supply and sales of the company
9119876 it is our responsibility to make sure that we serve only naturally grown and safe rice

9119886 to put the canadian people through an election before six months would have been irresponsible and in that case i would have decided in favour of the good of the canadian people and denied dissolution
9119887 and yet no action was taken by the establishment to correct the problem
9119888 minor findings are part of the audit process and are not uncommon
9119889 and were not well trained in the performance of their inspection tasks
9119890 i would however like to voice my concern over the tone of general statements made in the draft final report
9119891 nineteen of 20 slaughter and or processing establishments including cold storage had deficiencies in sanitation performance standards
9119892 in addition some of the sps requirements were not being enforced adequately in 19 of 20 establishments
9119893 even though this employee had a slightly raised area to stand on he was surrounded by water with blood in it
9119894 you couldnt have hit a harder blow to this sector this is the definitive fund
9119895 we have no idea whats going on they might be working on a replacement project but were in the dark so the message were trying to get out is to talk to us
9119896 in june 2007 the government of canada announced a 29 million renewal of the canada new media fund until the end of fiscal year 2008 09 the government of canada will be announcing its intentions for this program in the future
9119897 we have to look and see if theres some other ways just to make sure that we take into account those new changes in the way to do things im thinking about all the new technologies
9119898 the younger generation are now consuming so much of their media online and so much of that is being consumed at u s websites
9119899 if canadians want their kids to be consuming canadian content online this is the fund to spark innovation to create jobs and to create a viable industry without this fund its not going to exist so this is huge
9119900 the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9119901 shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9119902 im stunned this choice suggests mccain thinks he has an uphill climb to win this election
9119903 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house
9119904 it is almost impossible to exaggerate how important that is to the conservative faith community
9119905 this is a choice that allows mccain to keep the base happy but it also allows him to reinforce his image as a maverick
9119906 if we cant identify the risk we cant manage it and if we cant manage it we have no control over whats happening in terms of food borne illness
9119907 organic is a production standard that has nothing to do with food safety
9119908 people think its safer and they think that local is safer but there is no evidence of that
9119909 we have our susceptible populations and how do we protect them
9119910 sarah palin for her entire political career has been underestimated
9119911 shes tough shes tenacious i believe that she does have what it takes to get out there
9119912 id rather go moose hunting than be involved with politics
9119913 the landscape is littered with the bodies of those who crossed sarah
9119914 i remember asking sarah why she would enter a beauty pageant when that seemed so prissy to the rest of us
9119915 she told me matter of factly its going to help pay my way through college
9119916 i cant claim a bill clinton and say that i never inhaled
9119917 we see a person with an incredible amount of integrity that happens to like to hunt and fish and subscribe to all the things that make alaskans tick
9119918 at first they had me in a bunch of furs
9119919 yeah i have furs on my wall but i dont wear furs i had to show them my bunny boots and my north face clothing
9119920 when we first heard it was kind of confusing it was very very challenging
9119921 but now it just feels like he fits perfectly he is supposed to be here with us
9119922 it definitely makes it difficult because you cant help but love sarah palin she never comes across as full on republican
9119923 she has an extraordinary talent when it comes to communicating personally with people its as simple as that that obviously propelled her into the governors mansion in alaska
9119924 i beg you to have mercy and return my daughter

9119929 drawing largely on the unique resources of the boston college faculty in multiple disciplines the mcmullen is pleased to offer this re examination and in several cases new interpretations of georges rouaults oeuvre in the most comprehensive exhibition of his work mounted in north america in several decades
9119930 this irony a sometimes bitterly satirical one was often glossed over by a conventional piety in the presentation of his work from the time of his death in 1958 until the centenary of his birth in 1971
9119931 such dark reflections are redeemed for rouault by the human masques qualifier
9119932 i am very happy for every religion to maintain its identity while still fully participating in the civic life of the country but i am not persuaded that faith schools are the best way to heal our fractured society
9119933 hey touch this bike and ill appear from the bushes ready to club you with a two by four
9119934 the australian drought of the early twenty first century threw long standing chasms between use and realities of water supply into relief the issue of water scarcity in australia has always existed but as a nation we have always managed to ignore it however these present conditions have created increasing pressure for water users and managers to ensure adequate supplies for consumption
9119935 the information gained through risk screening exercises can aid in providing a national snapshot of risk prioritizing regions or individual catchments and identifying key drivers of risk for a more focused management effort
9119936 debate about water use in the murray is not simply one between environment and production but also on involving lifestyles given the increasing pressure on australias water resources it is essential that institutions appreciate and incorporate the value of amenities when making water resource management decisions

9119949 weve gotten to the point where we now go in and talk about invasive species at first they dont think they have anything to do with it we ask them to look at the tags on their shirts and the labels on their video games
