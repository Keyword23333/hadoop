4700007 the northwest passage may be ice free this summer for only the second time in recorded history
4700008 the canadian arctic is being fundamentally transformed as a result

4700010 only the russians are at present developing ways to ship both oil and gas from arctic offshore platforms
4700011 but surely the major north american companies must now be looking at the possibility of using a similar system

4700017 the harper government has promised to continue this work but has not publicly released any version of its strategy
4700018 time is running out if we do not have a clear policy framework for all shipping in the arctic it will be too late to do so after the new shipping arrives
4700019 the melting ice in the northwest passage is going to result in more international shipping in the arctic canada needs to be prepared for when it comes or else the world will simply ignore canada

4700027 this stat is according to a recent study did by essence magazine i heard about this stat on tyra banks what do you guys think about that i guess this is why there are so many forums as it relates to ir dating here on the aa topix i really do feel it has to do with appearance skin tone and hair length and texture the whole comparance thing between black women and none black women has been taken to another level by not only society but black men as well i guess i dont know if black men wanting none black women has more to do with just their preference which i am totally o k with or as some black women have suggested it has to do with self hatred i mean come on 73 that is fairly large number

4700273 the hotel is a massive scene an investigation has to be planned and managed very carefully fire scene investigators assisted by police experts will begin their work on monday
4700274 when that begins we will be able to build up a bigger picture of how the fire started
4700275 one of the workers at the hotel was a real hero
4700276 he was running around banging on all the doors to make sure people knew it was not a false alarm
4700277 it was because of his efforts and the efforts of the rest of the staff that they were able to get everyone out so quickly
4700278 when we got there we found the top floors and roof were well alight
4700279 we immediately asked for extra help and at the height of the fire we had 12 crews and two aerial ladders
4700280 the hotel has a really good evacuation policy and managed to evacuate all the residents fairly quickly
4700281 the whole roof void has been destroyed the top floors underneath have been destroyed by the fire and the hotel as a whole has been damaged by the water running down from the firefighting operation
4700282 it has been quite severely damaged but having said that firefighters have managed to save 75 per cent of the building
4700283 it was a major fire and with people sleeping in the property it could have been far far worse
4700284 the fire was very intensive we could only fight the flames from the inside for the first hour then it became too hot and we had to withdraw

4700295 coming down here has changed my whole thought because we are coming together we are coming together without any computers and no phones to be with our brothers and we are all brothers it is good
4700296 actually hes a funny guy once you get to know him
4700297 i can see hes a little more laid back a little more relaxed with us we feel more confident that he has a lot more confidence in us hes not uptight all the time
4700298 you always have your small group of friends that you hang out with on the weekend
4700299 here were in a totally different environment no one can go anywhere were stuck with each other thats just how it is
4700300 i get a chance to hang out with guys i never really hung out with before
4700301 i get a chance to see how funny they are and they get a chance to see how funny we are
4700302 they got their phones going off all the way until 3 in the morning and im trying to get some sleep its killing me
4700303 any time you throw a group of guys on a bus and go anywhere thats great because they all get to know each other a little bit better
4700304 there are so many similarities man teamwork listening to everybody
4700305 sometimes you cant be the biggest talker sometimes you have to listen because someone might have a better idea than you its big
4700306 i guess some guys in the past have kind of separated from the team concept but it sounds like theyre gone
4700307 this is a good group willie tuitama and ronnie palmer are great leaders
4700308 then you have cam and nate guys respect them because they work so hard
4700309 my god the godfather of r amp b creators has stepped behind the curtain and disappeared
4700310 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4700311 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4700312 columbia records had her for five years and i made the best record of her career the first time i took her into the studio
4700313 and i will say this to the black apologists the only black ass in that room was hers
4700314 it taught you that you have to trust the guy next to you that will transfer to the field
4700315 you need the guys around you to help you get across
4700316 once we got the kinks out and started to get a little togetherness established it was a breeze
4700317 these guys really showed their dedication some of these guys could easily be soldiers they were willing to do anything and work as a team and it showed
4700318 oh baby oh baby im home where is the fried chicken
4700319 it jammed up on me but i got two turkeys
4700320 you can tell these guys have a lot of pride and they want to do the best they can and then do some smack talking
4700321 if youve got a heart then gumbys a part of you
4700322 we are still working on too many drops we have to do a better job of concentrating and focusing
4700323 this is a good group when they work hard and they focus and pay attention to detail they are pretty average when they dont
4700324 when we are not doing something right coach dykes has to let us know and that is his way of telling us we were not doing our jobs we bounced back it was good to see that from the offense we have a lot of weapons across the board
4700325 they have to step up their game and have to understand that in this offense you have to rely on these guys
4700326 you have to be able to rely on them every single down we are working through that
4700327 we are going to play five games on the road this year so when you can pack your gear up and go to an environment you are not used to i think it is good for your players especially our young players
4700328 this is the first time they have traveled and been in this kind of an environment and have a chance to go out and perform
4700329 the players are talking about how the practice facility is great and about how the food is good they like everything probably this will lead into both sides wanting to do this again maybe even a little longer
4700330 we needed to do something that was going to provide a little bit of a break
4700331 it was a good tackle by devin just the way he hit me i thought it was pretty wrong at the time i just reacted wrong in a real game situation that would never happen
4700332 i look back at it and say it was stupid real stupid
4700333 for one hes my teammate for two i have a lot of self control and i didnt have it there

4700368 it was there from the first lap the first turn
4700369 we tried some things during practice that didnt work at all so we went back to where we were and i think thats one of the best qualifying cars ive ever had it was a heck of a lap sometimes you just hit it you dont know why

4700388 and thats what i tell them at the beginning because sometimes they can hear it from a doctor they can hear it from their family but when they hear it from somebody who has actually sat in a hospital bed and gone from a hospital bed to an olympic podium it gives them a lot more hope
4700389 i remember doing it and it was probably the hardest run ive ever done in my life
4700390 but after that day i was able to progress a lot more and now i can run 400 meters in 53 seconds
4700391 i stayed on active duty and went to the games in 2004 i won a gold medal and a silver medal a gold medal in the 4 x 100 relay and a silver in the mens pentathlon setting a new american record

4700544 china is going through a green push and theres a lot of buildings that have these elements water recycling maximizing natural light etc its all moving in that direction

4700634 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4700635 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4700636 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4700699 cut his hair really short shave it dont tell him he wont know
4700700 why are you shaving the top of my head what are you doing
4700701 whats he going to do about it nothing because he cant youre the one with the clipper
4700702 i still dont think either one of them is at a point to be in a serious committed relationship but they get along and have fun together
4700703 ive been in love for the same woman for 30 plus years warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
4700704 not answering the question hes buying time to give an appropriate innocent response they werent asking how great is your wife they were asking about the accuracy of the story
4700705 when a person is getting ready to tell a lie they repeat the question back because they need time to formulate an innocent response
4700706 its pretty clear that when john edwards is getting ready to tell a lie his affect is inappropriate
4700707 he smiles a lot during this interview when he shouldnt be smiling its almost like a nervous preparation to get his lie out
4700708 i dont know why men lie they just do men lie
4700709 oh right youre the guy from the youtube videos awesome i love those videos
4700710 the oil on the beaches is still there affecting the animals
4700711 even with millions of new clips coming online each day online video is still in its infancy and as the survey shows habits have yet to be fully formed
4700712 the video web is dictating a fundamental break from the traditional search model a departure that represents a tremendous vote of confidence in web 2 0
4700713 its now about discovery and browsing and navigating in non linear ways social media works more like a real community than any constructed community the web may have sought to create up to this point which is why discovery and recommendations figure so prominently in the mix
4700714 social media mimics the way that we interact when were offline it traces the sometimes circular sometimes whimsical paths of relationships and follows a few tangents
4700715 its clear that video consumers know at a gut level that if a picture is worth a thousand words theres no way that metadata will ever be enough
4700716 its going to boost their self esteem and help send them back to class with confidence
4700717 this year our mens ministry will be giving away neckties and we have some with the matching suspenders
4700718 i cant wait to see how they go really we just want to give back and show love in a tangible way
4700719 we are seeking to minister to the whole person not just from a religious standpoint because we understand there are other things in the house that need to be addressed
4700720 every issue that weve found in the schools has either already been resolved or will be resolved by the start of school
4700721 its not that we dont trust them but we need evidence that it was completed
4700722 im hoping they realize that having an al teacher on campus for one day is not enough to meet the needs of the al kids
4700723 even though all the boxes might be checked im not sure the spirit of whats intended is whats being met
4700724 they did not believe that those children were being challenged
4700725 that they were given more work to do not necessarily richer or deeper
4700726 if you had asked that question in september i might have said yes because not everyone understood the importance of a program review they do now
4700727 some want to know what they are or if theyll ever grow leaves or bear fruit
4700728 the people we like most are the ones who come up and tell us how beautiful they are
4700729 in the old times people would take marble and create a beautiful statue
4700730 we want to give life to end of life and were doing just that
4700731 she will also see what its like in the real world
4700732 im going to do something great with my life your deaths wont be in vain
4700733 they made the ultimate sacrifice so i need to do something with my life i cant lie down and let the world beat me because i have to think this happened for a reason
4700734 god wouldnt make me live through this hell for nothing this is the opening this is when i start my life

4700738 you ever listen to george jones and one of his better songs choices
4700739 that song has so much meaning hes talking about your conscience the voices you hear in your mind
4700740 well the voices i heard were michael needs to be taken care of and ive never regretted it i honestly feel i was supposed to do that
4700741 you can do anything as long as you keep your head straight
4700742 i want to become a pediatric oncologist because i love you guys
4700743 you see i lost my mom and dad to cancer and i would like nothing better than to find a cure
4700744 we toured the outside of yad vashem the holocaust museum and the coolest thing happened when we were in the valley of the communities while we were having a short memorial service a pure yellow butterfly flew over us it was one of the most meaningful experiences in my life the butterfly was so moving because recently we had been studying the holocaust in school we read the poem i never saw another butterfly that poem was written by a young boy in theterezin ghetto during wwii
4700745 restoration its what brought us here all the way to costa rica its almost as if through the restoration of the bathrooms i have seen a restoration of myself and the rest of my mission team every piece of tile laid every bit of mortar scraped and every drop of sweat shed has made us grow
4700746 were growing into the selfless people im pretty sure god wants us to be
4700747 we returned to a project we had done earlier in the week d c central kitchen prepares meals and foods for various outreach programs around the city on one evening we peeled and chopped carrots for three hours and on another evening we shucked corn
4700748 when the deck was completely finished and carl was sitting on his new deck he made the comment that he thought there werent any more good people left in this world especially young people he also said that we had given him hope it was really amazing to know that we had been able to show him through the work we had done that there still are really good young people left in the world it amazed me to know that with only three days of work we could do so much to help someone this experience gave me a new look on what i do because now i know that even small things can make a big difference on someones life i hope that i will be able to do more mission trips and help even more people
4700749 i am on a campaign to show the youth its more than one way to hustle
4700750 the rule is not nearly as strong as we would like it to be but its a whole lot stronger than what people are doing now
4700751 he is an intelligent boy and that is always a very good ingredient when you are intelligent in life and with talent you always have a chance
4700752 for me he is a player who has a good engine good technique and vision he can play the final ball which we like here
4700753 he has the technical level to go into any combination and is very mobile
4700754 we believe he has the ingredients to fit into our game
4700755 i expect he will fit well into our collective game and that he expresses a good attitude is very ambitious and fights very hard for the team
4700756 we wont greenlight until we have brands lined up who want to be in the show
4700757 when i look at us as a network we are about a list talent high end production and the ability to create a safe place for brands to play
4700758 having rosario dawson attached makes that an easier conversation to have
4700759 hed leave it there for two days then take it away his plants were always happy you could also use a nursery flat or a piece of cardboard
4700760 ill do a series of meetings with the hgtv people and some phone calls and from there my life changes
4700761 its all kind of still happening but its full steam ahead toward the show
4700762 the goal is to do a show where people could learn and laugh and not feel that they wasted 30 minutes of their life
4700763 my husband and i have always been on a budget when we try to do things in our own home and with our clients as well
4700764 so the idea is how do you make something cost efficient look like you spent a million bucks
4700765 the first thing you hear when you win the show is your lifes going to change
4700766 you know the payoff will be great but you also know its going to be a ton of work theres a lot of nervous excitement you know youre going to have to produce but luckily for me i have the 100 percent support of my husband and thats what it takes to make this happen
4700767 while i was off filming he cared for the business
4700768 and he even got us more business so hes the unsung hero
4700769 because if you have to do the clap and back away the move the loser is asked to make to give the winner the spotlight then i was going to fall down so i was just thinking how i was going to back away
4700770 as soon as they announced it everything just washes over you
4700771 i was completely stunned i couldnt move i was shocked and then i looked at my husband and i couldnt have been any happier because we have struggled for so long
4700772 serene gardens creating japanese design and detail in the western garden
4700773 the judge felt the district complied with the law and that the audits meet the code section
4700774 if a department thinks they can impose discipline and not have a hearing where a peace officer can have his day in court then the whole process becomes a farce
4700775 we will ensure that hearing occurs in very short order
4700776 we have an almost constant presence on the streets of roseville
4700777 the refuse truck drivers know the neighborhoods they serve and usually know if something isnt quite right
4700778 i have a young man whos been stopped 35 times a good young man working in the community and a young lady stopped 16 times in the last two years
4700779 there are a lot more officers patrolling and you can walk in the park now
4700780 the more stops you have in oak park is a good thing
4700781 you get kids that look suspicious and officers may want to pull them over for a broken taillight and you find out one of these kids is an a student at sac high
4700782 absolutely racial profilings going on in oak park its a very culturally damaging experience that should have died out decades ago
4700783 if im not doing anything wrong i dont want be harassed
4700784 if oak park is getting better then we dont want to tie their hands
4700785 the murders youth killings gangs drug abuse dealing openly brazenly have plunged downward please do not roll back the progress thats been made
4700786 they know were going to listen to you and be fair the relationships more harmonious and theyve stepped up and helped us by calling about problems
4700787 it makes you better when you overcome that this generation is the entitlement generation they are not willing to work hard
4700788 these jurisdictions are going around and around doing this dance with each other and two major developers
4700789 you could certainly make the case that there are two or three developers who could sit down and talk this over and make peace and create a purple and white map
4700790 roseville is approaching build out give or take rocklin is built out lincoln is really the only city left in placer county that doesnt have a critical mass
4700791 anytime you start to make a map youre going to have a lot of white heat on that process
4700792 youre going to throw this away were not going to be blamed for this
4700793 let us look for a young virgin to attend the king and take care of him she can lie beside him so that our lord the king may keep warm
4700794 have you not heard that adonijah the son of haggith has become king without our lord davids knowing it
4700795 surely solomon your son shall be king after me and he will sit on my throne
4700796 my lord you yourself swore to me your servant by the your god solomon your son shall be king after me and he will sit on my throne 18 but now adonijah has become king and you my lord the king do not know about it 19 he has sacrificed great numbers of cattle fattened calves and sheep and has invited all the kings sons abiathar the priest and joab the commander of the army but he has not invited solomon your servant 20 my lord the king the eyes of all israel are on you to learn from you who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him 21 otherwise as soon as my lord the king is laid to rest with his fathers i and my son solomon will be treated as criminals
4700797 have you my lord the king declared that adonijah shall be king after you and that he will sit on your throne 25 today he has gone down and sacrificed great numbers of cattle fattened calves and sheep he has invited all the kings sons the commanders of the army and abiathar the priest right now they are eating and drinking with him and saying long live king adonijah 26 but me your servant and zadok the priest and benaiah son of jehoiada and your servant solomon he did not invite 27 is this something my lord the king has done without letting his servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him
4700798 as surely as the lives who has delivered me out of every trouble 30 i will surely carry out today what i swore to you by the the god of israel solomon your son shall be king after me and he will sit on my throne in my place
4700799 call in zadok the priest nathan the prophet and benaiah son of jehoiada
4700800 take your lords servants with you and set solomon my son on my own mule and take him down to gihon 34 there have zadok the priest and nathan the prophet anoint him king over israel blow the trumpet and shout long live king solomon 35 then you are to go up with him and he is to come and sit on my throne and reign in my place i have appointed him ruler over israel and judah
4700801 amen may the the god of my lord the king so declare it lord was with my lord the king so may he be with solomon to make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord king david
4700802 whats the meaning of all the noise in the city
4700803 come in a worthy man like you must be bringing good news
4700804 adonijah is afraid of king solomon and is clinging to the horns of the altar
4700805 if he shows himself to be a worthy man not a hair of his head will fall to the ground but if evil is found in him he will die
4700806 i am about to go the way of all the earth
4700807 now you yourself know what joab son of zeruiah did to me what he did to the two commanders of israels armies abner son of ner and amasa son of jether
4700808 but show kindness to the sons of barzillai of gilead and let them be among those who eat at your table they stood by me when i fled from your brother absalom
4700809 and remember you have with you shimei son of gera the benjamite from bahurim who called down bitter curses on me the day i went to mahanaim when he came down to meet me at the jordan i swore to him by the i will not put you to death by the sword 9 but now do not consider him innocent you are a man of wisdom you will know what to do to him bring his gray head down to the grave in blood
4700810 the kingdom was mine all israel looked to me as their king but things changed and the kingdom has gone to my brother for it has come to him from the 16 now i have one request to make of you do not refuse me
4700811 please ask king solomon he will not refuse you to give me abishag the shunammite as my wife
4700812 let abishag the shunammite be given in marriage to your brother adonijah
4700813 why do you request abishag the shunammite for adonijah you might as well request the kingdom for him after all he is my older brother yes for him and for abiathar the priest and joab son of zeruiah
4700814 may god deal with me be it ever so severely if adonijah does not pay with his life for this request lives he who has established me securely on the throne of my father david and has founded a dynasty for me as he promised adonijah shall be put to death today
4700815 go back to your fields in anathoth you deserve to die but i will not put you to death now because you carried the ark of the sovereign before my father david and shared all my fathers hardships
4700816 do as he says strike him down and bury him and so clear me and my fathers house of the guilt of the innocent blood that joab shed
4700817 build yourself a house in jerusalem and live there but do not go anywhere else 37 the day you leave and cross the kidron valley you can be sure you will die your blood will be on your own head
4700818 what you say is good your servant will do as my lord the king has said
4700819 you know in your heart all the wrong you did to my father david now the
4700820 i can go out into the garden any day and pick an armload of produce

4700854 im 47 year old who enjoys living everyday of my life to the fullest my family is the most important part of my life i love playing softball watching college and pro football and basketball
4700855 im a mural artist who has discovered the challenge of painting on canvas rather than walls its limited space but i love it what better place to crawl into your thoughts when you can create them in front of your own eyes
4700856 i am a stay at home mom who needs a break from the 17 month old that i call my son he is very active and keeps me very busy my husband and i recently relocated with his job
4700857 i am single and looking and am told by pogo chatters that i am funny i have a serious side and am very opinionated about things in our world and life in general i dont smoke and drink socially and i am a great cook
4700858 i am the last born of a big family and also a twin my parents were in the navy so we traveled around a bit and then decided to settle in georgia no i am not a peach per se but
4700859 i was born and raised a redneck from the south in my home town of wichita kansas but i now live in michigan i enjoy football camping occasionally visiting the casino and playing pogo games
4700860 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon
4700861 this is what i am i cannot change it i have peace in my heart about who i am this is not about the church it is about my relationship with god
4700862 it is an act of love to reach out to such a person god in fact loves sinners but he speaks to them through the bible to realise their wrongs
4700863 now dominee according to this people are not allowed to get a divorce and if they do they may not re marry as they will then be adulterous
4700864 yet your church accepts people who do this but condemns gays
4700865 god said there is forgiveness and mercy for every divorcee and homosexual who repents
4700866 sitting on the sidelines watching a lot of cricket gave me the opportunity to reflect on my bowling as well as that of the other guys and figure out what i need to do
4700867 in the tests i walk seven or eight metres further back than my marker and im sprinting when i hit it against the lions i ran in from the marker and eased to the crease i didnt want to get too intense too quickly
4700868 the pitch suited my style of bowling and it worked out very well ill bowl the same way at derby and just build it up before the t20 match and the first odi on friday
4700869 in particular we didnt bowl in partnerships what we do know about odi cricket is that the batsmen will come after us so its even more important than usual to stick to our disciplines and not bowl in the batsmens areas
4700870 if we bowl a good ball and get hit for four then well done the batsman but we know that if we keep on hitting our areas well take wickets
4700871 we will cross that bridge when we come to it
4700872 there is nothing to stop us from discharging our obligations under the law and there is nothing that suggests we cant put a proposal on the table
4700873 if mr zumas lawyers feel that they are not being accommodated they can approach the pietermaritzburg high court it is for the court to decide whether their reasons are legally valid
4700874 the first thing that pops into your head is that its bigfoot
4700875 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4700876 it is not possible that he honestly believed that he did not have to pay income tax on amounts in excess of half a million rand earned at each of these occasions
4700877 if he honestly believed that the income tax treatment of the sacrificed commissions was correct he should have explained to the court why he held that belief
4700878 i rap because its how i pay my bills i cant get a job in mcdonalds and have a kid telling me kane let me get a burger and some fries and no half steppin with that either
4700879 if people keep watching tv were going to force failure
4700880 this current life is the life when we milk you
4700881 i am on a campaign to show the youth its more than one way to
4700882 the show is a funhouse mirror version of the neighborhood i knew growing up
4700883 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4700884 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4700885 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4700886 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4700887 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4700888 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4700889 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4700890 we have the most talent weve had since those guys left
4700891 we have the most cohesiveness too we blend well together
4700892 he has a head for the game hes not a super freak athlete but his knowledge of the game helps him hes really a good shooter coming off the screen
4700893 hes an active athlete a sneaky athlete like a skinnier bobby jones he can shoot a little when he gets rebounding and the defensive concept down hell help us
4700894 the biggest thing ive got from playing from him is his passing
4700895 hes a ridiculous passer he sees the whole floor which a big man like me likes to see and he makes unbelievable passes
4700896 we need a little nastiness in us where you dont mess with us
4700897 hes conscious of where the ball needs to go but hes not throwing it around the gym like he did last summer
4700898 hes gotten a lot more aggressive hes a big key for us were definitely going to need him to step up and play like a veteran
4700899 at the same time it gives us a pretty good opportunity to be in the spotlight in the winter were going to be the show
4700900 if someone dont want my content it is their own personal hell
4700901 blood wasnt going to make the discus slip out of my hands
4700902 but i dont know if thats the reason i threw so bad
4700903 maybe by then ill be good enough that i can get a medal
4700904 we were all quite fascinated by the champion zhuang zedong
4700905 i was in primary school and we had a stone table
4700906 we all tried to get the table to play during our 10 minute recess
4700907 but the young people have a lot of choices they have many chances to do other sports when i was young we only had ping pong
4700908 i think my generation is the last generation who are interested in playing ping pong
4700909 the prognosis is good trauma center under the knife 2 channels the spirit of the first game and then some with a tighter presentation and a developed story sure to reward players whove persevered with derek in the first installment and though its sabbatical from the ds hasnt exactly provided a lot of new ideas poking around someones insides still remains one of the dssurest thrills
4700910 he would say all the time im sick of this
4700911 said enos one of osullivans favorite targets at uc davis
4700912 there was something about him even when he first came here
4700913 there was just an air of confidence and thats something you look for in a quarterback some would say its arrogance but its not arrogance its confidence and his confidence comes from his preparation
4700914 i dont know how long hes spent with this offense but you can tell he knows it hes very confident and thats huge
4700915 no one talks when j t s talking and if they are theyre not talking for long
4700916 he said were going to make this play and were going to celebrate in the end zone
4700917 it was like the clouds parted for that one instant
4700918 after a couple of teams theres a sense that youre just a journeyman

4700935 that song has so much meaning hes talking about your conscience the voices you hear in your mind
4700936 well the voices i heard were michael needs to be taken care of and ive never regretted it i honestly feel i was supposed to do that

4700977 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4700978 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4700979 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
4700980 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
4700981 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
4700982 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
4700983 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
4700984 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income

4700986 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers

4700998 die theesener sind in allen mannschaftsteilen top besetzt und waren in der vergangenen saison mit 81 treffern die torfabrik der liga im testspiel gegen den sch fer klub al ain hat mich die mannschaft beeindruckt da muss bei uns schon alles passen um dort zu punkten vor allem taktisch m ssen wir uns gut verkaufen
4700999 alle zuletzt angeschlagenen spieler sind fit und haben das abschlusstraining mitgemacht benjamin martin ist aus dem urlaub zur ck und mario ljubas kommt am samstagmittag heim und wird dann auch zum kader geh ren
4701000 mit k string dreier und kowylczyk fehlen uns drei ganz wichtige leute im mittelfeld die auch kopfballstark sind
4701001 au erdem sind arne goe ling pascal spier und arkadius nowicki durch verletzungen und berufliche verpflichtungen nicht auf ihrem alten leistungsstand ich habe keine gro artigen personellen alternativen der kader ist sehr eng so dass sich die favoritenrolle eindeutig beantwortet der vfl ist in der bezirksliga ein etabliertes team und hat immer oben in der tabelle mitgespielt bei uns muss schon alles passen aber nichts ist unm glich
4701002 trotz aller euphorie um unseren gro en pokalauftritt habe ich immer gesagt dass die liga an erster stelle steht
4701003 ich werde mich zur ckhalten obwohl es in den f en kribbelt
4701004 trotz der vielen neuen leute haben wir eine gute vorbereitung hinter uns
4701005 spexard ist zwar favorit doch einen z hler traue ich uns zu

4701008 as the economy improves and business improves along with it we will staff accordingly
4701009 i believe that what we create here with the newspaper and web site will continue to be relevant and reliable sources of information
4701010 nearly two thirds of all adults in pima county read one of the two newspapers and or look at the web sites every week
4701011 while these steps we are taking are painful i hope we can all emerge from this economic downturn stronger
4701012 roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4701013 cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
4701014 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4701015 explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values
4701016 every speech should contain the line you were born in the middle of america to the middle class in the middle of the last century
4701017 i was born into a middle class family in the middle of the country in the middle of the last century
4701018 i know that there is a genuine effort to unite the party and i think you are going to see plenty of evidence of that during the convention itself
4701019 i am absolutely baffled that anybody would say that barack doesnt meet every single test of genuine americanism when you consider his life story
4701020 he has a phenomenal life story and i think it is one of his great assets to be raised by your grandparents and to be raised as a minority and to rise up and live out the american dream is the essence of america
4701021 i tell you i have seen a lot of democratic consultant stuff that was half baked and crazy and this is as half baked as it gets you pay for it that is the sad thing about it
4701022 it was a good tackle by devin just the way he hit me i thought it was pretty wrong at the time i just reacted wrong in a real game situation that would never happen
4701023 i look back at it and say it was stupid real stupid
4701024 for one hes my teammate for two i have a lot of self control and i didnt have it there
4701025 not allowed to make any things but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts
4701026 congress has the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof
4701027 a coin dollar is worth no more for the purposes of tender in payment of an ordinary debt than a note dollar the law has not made the note a standard of value anymore than coin it is true that in the market as an article of merchandise one is of greater value than the other but as money as a medium of exchange the law knows no difference between them
4701028 we the tax payers would want to hear that the irs was defeated by the use of the true money
4701029 we have more than 60 years of experience helping the most vulnerable populations recover from conflict

4701032 flexus tm is the culmination of utilizing surgeon input and engineering simplicity to create innovative technologies to treat spinal stenosis the flexus tm ide reflects globus position as the worldwide leader in the development of posterior motion preservation devices we are excited to begin the clinical trial to develop strong supportive data for the product
4701033 the combination of a unilateral approach and a unitary implant makes flexus tm not only a more efficient procedure but also one that is less traumatic to the patient
4701034 i am pleased with the peek design as it will enable better radiographic follow up and allow me to monitor both the decompression and the adjacent anatomy
4701035 the surgical technique and approach was very straightforward the simplicity of the flexus tm design in distracting the stenotic segment may be beneficial in treating this painful condition we are excited to participate in this ide
4701036 whoever the next president is he will have significant difficulties to deal with in the us russia relationship
4701037 senator obamas view is that we need to review all aspects of our bilateral and multilateral arrangements with russia in order to assess where they ought to go from here
4701038 if russia is going to take the position that not only is it not interested in integrating in that fashion but it is not going to allow its supposedly sovereign and independent neighbors to do so that calls into doubt the entire premise of us european and western international relations with russia
4701039 i dont think there is much difference between the candidates on this question and its going to be a huge challenge for the next administration
4701040 a mccain administration would be directly and overtly adversarial to russia but i think that you can overstate the differences between the two candidates on this subject
4701041 the russian government desperately wants the west to treat it as an important and respected great power
4701042 we can and should withhold that treatment no diplomatic business as usual
4701043 its my first elvis week im a little ashamed to say that but it is
4701044 we watch it on the computer last year and i finally said i have to be part of that
4701045 i have to come and check on him to make sure hes ok
4701046 i tell them he ate breakfast at 5 oclock in the afternoon but then hed eat dinner at 1 oclock at night
4701047 we always had a meat loaf cooked just in case he wanted it if he didnt want meat loaf then we knew to give him roast beef he liked soul food
4701048 given the pattern of the thing its not unreasonable for people to ask
4701049 the media and a large chunk of the public including some of johns supporters still question whether hes told the whole truth
4701050 happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
4701051 i feel sorry for his family because how horrible but also dont you think he is the father of the child
4701052 anybody whos been around campaigns knows that folks come and go
4701053 we have a lock down situation we have cameras but the question we had to answer is what if somebody gets in what are we going to do
4701054 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4701055 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4701056 we have a lock down situation we have cameras but the question we had to answer is what if somebody gets in what are we going to do
4701057 at this rate reconstruction will last 10 years and a generation of our citizens of our children will be raised in inequality because they live in huts and have nowhere to study
4701058 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4701059 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4701060 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4701061 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4701062 when youre playing in front of 50 family members and everybody is expecting something its kind of like a playoff atmosphere almost
4701063 he snyder told me he had some friends sitting behind home plate watching the game for some reason i really wanted to hit a home run
4701064 i didnt have location its very difficult for me if i cant throw the ball where i want to
4701065 so we got through the second and we thought ok here we go
4701066 it feels good you cant lie having a night like that in front of family and friends
4701067 coming home is great but thats icing on the cake right there
4701068 there are certainly things that didnt end up the way id have liked them to
4701069 im happy to be here for me ive got plenty of incentive every time i take the field its tough to add to that
4701070 everyone is in good spirits and the last time i was down here it really wasnt like that i feel so much better to be out here and having fun were having fun playing basketball and having fun with each other
4701071 there was so much tension last season it was good to see them and im sure they will do well next year
4701072 it was great to be around these former wildcats the family atmosphere said former ua player joseph blair
4701073 you can see the dedication and loyalty we have to the program
4701074 save my legs for the season i cant come in here and play anymore
4701075 i didnt surprise myself i knew i could do that kind of stuff said bayless who averaged 29 8 points in the summer league
4701076 i just wasnt allowed to do that stuff at ua whatever though it was a great experience
4701077 now if people are interested because they heard something happened i guess its a positive i could go out and play a clean match and people will ask why i didnt get mad
4701078 my belief is that because at amp ts network is not built out to every cell site people are getting frustrated because theyre finding places where the 3g signal isnt available or is weak
4701079 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain infineon is the 3g supplier
4701080 from the phones antenna and amplifier and the radio frequency transceiver to the baseband that processes the digital signal and sends it to the speaker or screen
4701081 we are dealing with radio waves at a high frequency many things could cause these issues
4701082 even peoples sweaty hands could have an effect or how close they hold the device to their heads or in what direction they are pointing the phone
4701083 id be surprised if it is as simple as a firmware upgrade so it is more likely that existing devices will have this defect forever
4701084 companies with problems must clearly acknowledge they have a problem then tell their customers what they are doing to try and fix it as quickly as possible
4701085 rim as an example learned the hard way that being silent when your customers are having issues network outage is not a good strategy
4701086 unfortunately given their history i am not sure apple will be as forthcoming as they should be
4701087 people are wary of draining their battery and not being able to make calls
4701088 battery life isnt helped by having gps and wi fi turned on nor by having a large bright screen for navigation or web browsing but there is clear demand for those features and applications and advances in battery technology would enable quite substantial changes in usage patterns with all the service revenue benefits that would bring
4701089 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
4701090 there are too many instances on iphone blogs and apples own website for it to be coincidence furthermore it is not just the u s but other countries as well
4701091 its not about whether you have problems or dont have them
4701092 its how quickly you address them that matters if apple addresses them people will cut them slack

4701097 its acceptable for enterprise use if the security it provides is the same as other handsets in play
4701098 theres much more granularity with these apps as the e mail is richer and it now permits background processing
4701099 the iphone reacts the same as a windows mobile device forcing the use of a complex password and clearing the device contents when the password policy is violated
4701100 neither wants to go there as its too much work and not enough payoff
4701101 apple will make its millions in the consumer space while rim will make its money in the enterprise
4701102 zuabi and his cast not only embrace and cherish the authors passions they honour his passing with dignity and grace
4701103 a vivid piece of lateral thinking which takes darwishs words off the page and puts flesh and blood on a statesmanlike meditation
4701104 besides our efforts to push the political negotiations between israel and the palestinian authority we see the utmost importance in supporting the flourishing of the palestinian economy with the guarantee of the security for the israelis
4701105 i f the israelis blow their secrets they insist theyll lose the next war
4701106 decision makers were the heroes on this because they showed the world whats right and whats wrong

4701111 hamas completely rejects the entrance of any foreign or arab forces to the west bank or gaza strip under any pretext
4701112 arab forces can come to liberate the west bank from the occupation and free our citizens from the oppression they suffer under due to the security coordination between fayyads security agencies and the occupation
4701113 there is another problem facing president abbas the end of his presidential term in january
4701114 he will thus lose his legitimacy as president if elections are not held whereas if a transitional government is formed from a legal perspective it will allow the president to remain in his position until presidential and legislative elections are held
4701115 the peace and stability being currently enjoyed by ghanaians should not be taken for granted
4701116 the reality is that there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off of a presidential campaign we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means necessary

4701127 es una novela fascinante es muy fragmentaria y la gente no deber a esperar que le atrape pero nabokov consigue con la prosa momentos muy brillantes la trama apenas fulge los personajes son m s bien poco atractivos parece un tour de force de t cnica como las obras tard as de shakespeare en las que despliega su propia t cnica en formas muy muy concentradas el texto es a veces tan grotesco y desagradable como en algunos pasajes de lolita es la clase de escritura que produce admiraci n y sobrecogimiento pero no compromiso

4701133 we have an ongoing investigation with goldman sachs in the course of investigations were also having discussions
4701134 we were surprised that new york sent us a letter threatening legal action on auction rate securities
4701135 we have been discussing this issue with new york and other regulators since we announced last week our plan to purchase our retail clients ars and we thought we were making progress we anticipated further talks
4701136 there are dozens of firms whove been involved in this area
4701137 todays agreement in principle underscores our desire to ensure that clients who purchased ars at wachovia receive the liquidity they need
4701138 when everyone else is settling there is no place to hide
4701139 if it wasnt for the secretary of state in missouri and others i dont think we would have gotten anywhere
4701140 i dealt with wachovia people until i was blue in the face and they categorically denied selling this as a money market but if they dont want to admit they did wrong shame on them

4701143 no matter how far we are from our country it is still very close to our heart
4701144 indians must stand united above politics cast creed and colour and to work towards the betterment of the nation
4701145 today we must think of oneness of people and of contributing jointly to the society though we might speak in different tongues eat different foods or wear different kinds of clothes in the end we are all humans this must be our vision
4701146 i need to see some of these bubble guys the way you get your question answered is to see them play against the best people i need to see some of that at the same time theres just some guys who need to play in the second half of that game theres going to be some people that were going to need to see play a little bit longer that way too

4701151 we saw this in a theater full of kids and there wasnt a single moment that caused spontaneous cheering
4701152 ziro the hutt is perhaps the most bizarre character ever created in the series history yes including jar jar a jabba shaped slug who wears face paint and feathers the creature speaks english rather than huttese except that he she somehow has the accent of truman capote by way of eric cartman of south park
4701153 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally
4701154 the character was so bad so incredibly awful that it was a slap to the face it is many times worse than im actually describing this character was actually too much for me
4701155 after meeting ahsoka we really understand why he killed all the younglings id have done it with my bare hands she calls him skyguy which is amazingly annoying and he calls her snips
4701156 of course the anakin ahsoka relationship is made impossibly awkward by the fact that shes half naked and 12 and that theyre always in close quarters i dont need the force to see this fan fiction coming
4701157 the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come

4701160 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4701161 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
4701162 he didnt look good to me and i knew this could be it
4701163 i said hey bernard how are you and i kissed his forehead
4701164 he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse
4701165 the doctor came in and i said hes gone isnt he
4701166 he said you never seen a black man as pretty as me
4701167 i said what do you have for me and he kissed me that was our first kiss
4701168 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4701169 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that senator mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4701170 actually i dont really know how i got the nickname
4701171 it just came up and people started talking to me and going hey bonus jonas and i was like hey whatever
4701172 hell tell it straight up and hell be mean if he needs to
4701173 once i got comfortable with having diabetes frankie used to call me pancreas boy but hes the cutest kid alive so he can get away with it
4701174 i remember sitting down with frankie and said nick is in the hospital and hell be home in a couple of days
4701175 theres a time and place for everything and now is the time
4701176 i felt like there was no bigger event in hip hop at this moment than me and t i working together
4701177 it was always turmoil between our camp and his camp us as the bosses of our companies everyone is gonna follow our lead wed figure if it aint no problem and we dont have no issues no beef then theres no reason we shouldnt be able to get together and make music that was an executive decision that was made on both our behalves
4701178 i was surprised just as much as everybody else was
4701179 i talked to luda and he said it was time to sit down do business make grown man moves both of them got albums coming out time to try new things cris did something for t i too that nobody heard yet its about to come out soon its a good move
4701180 its showing that once great minds set their differences aside they can make something happen
4701181 thats two grown men not two grown males grown men

4701185 rick ross orchestrated a brutal attack upon dj vlad carried out at his direction by his accomplices in retribution for media coverage of
4701186 painstakingly created his public persona to be that of a major drug dealer and gangster but is in reality a former correctional officer
4701187 ive been hearing things about me on your web site we gonna make a story we going to see each other we going to talk where are you
4701188 following a brief conversation between dj vlad and ross in which ross said we got beef ross accomplices who had surrounded dj vlad while he spoke with ross proceeded to strike and beat dj vlad in ross presence and without any protest on ross part
4701189 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4701190 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4701191 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4701192 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
4701193 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
4701194 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4701195 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
4701196 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
4701197 like the housing industry real estate guru mark bosworth is in crash mode
4701198 the idea is to play as similar to brazilian football as we can
4701199 the characteristics are different we try to learn things about dribbling controlling the ball passing the ball touching the ball one twos we will try it
4701200 but i need to respect the identity of the players i need to respect the quality of the players
4701201 i need to impress on them what i think about football we have some players who play similar to those in brazil but others who dont
4701202 abramovich wants chelsea to play very well and win the fans are the same
4701203 they want us to play very well and win its not just mr abramovich but they need to understand that sometimes its difficult to play beautifully and win
4701204 sometimes its impossible because the other team plays a different style
4701205 well he was a pillar of pomposity and the boy was trespassing
4701206 i dont mean to brag but i make a mean swamp rat stew
4701207 and i aint no preacher but heres my erick sermon
4701208 so eat this black music and tell me how it tastes now and f jesse jackson cause it aint about race now
4701209 walk through the gates of hell see my impala parked in front with the high beams on me and the devil sharin chronic blunts listening to pictures of don imus for target practice
4701210 i know obama would but would hillary take part i feel the pain of nelson mandela cause when it rains it pours i need rihannas umbrella for coretta scott kings teardrops when she got the phone call that the future just took a f ing headshot
4701211 i wonder why jesse jackson aint catch him before his body dropped
4701212 just me taking flight man this album is gonna be real special from beginning to end its gonna knock
4701213 no kidding is that your diagnosis your freakin professional opinion is that why my head feels like its gonna explode sometimes is that why i find myself despite my unyielding respect for women sizing up attractive women i pass on the street like a judge at the westminster kennel show why i feel like im turning into the stereotypical male pig huh really maybe you could give me a effing prescription for my condition and i do mean that literally
4701214 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you
4701215 the summer break gave me the opportunity to focus on recharging my batteries im looking forward to getting back into the cockpit next friday looking at the season so far it feels like a different championship to 2007
4701216 last year was intense and consistency was incredibly important this year everybodys results have been varied i think well see consistency becoming crucial as we head towards the end of the season
4701217 the most intriguing finding was that subjects seemed to accept mushrooms as a palatable and suitable culinary substitute for meat
4701218 they didnt compensate for the lower calorie mushroom meal by eating more food later in the day

4701224 roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4701225 cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
4701226 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4701227 explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values
4701228 every speech should contain the line you were born in the middle of america to the middle class in the middle of the last century
4701229 i was born into a middle class family in the middle of the country in the middle of the last century
4701230 i know that there is a genuine effort to unite the party and i think you are going to see plenty of evidence of that during the convention itself
4701231 i am absolutely baffled that anybody would say that barack doesnt meet every single test of genuine americanism when you consider his life story
4701232 he has a phenomenal life story and i think it is one of his great assets to be raised by your grandparents and to be raised as a minority and to rise up and live out the american dream is the essence of america
4701233 i tell you i have seen a lot of democratic consultant stuff that was half baked and crazy and this is as half baked as it gets you pay for it that is the sad thing about it

4701259 if the proposed ordinance becomes law each and every volunteer for the city will be forced to undergo the complete battery of trainings deemed essential by the kneejerk nine
4701260 im not aware of what outside consultants will be hired to conduct all of this training but i suspect that somewhere in this fair city of ours some training consultants are toasting the kneejerk nine with fine champagne
4701261 if you dont need e sata ie running an external sata drive leave it off
4701262 the reality is that there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off of a presidential campaign we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means necessary
4701263 there were a lot of conspiracy theories and there still are understandably in that part of the world
4701264 there is no point talking about the incident after 20 years there are many more important issues in the country at this point
4701265 there was nothing pointing to any kind of gas whatever in any of the reports i read
4701266 why after all this evidence has poured in that house is innocent of the crime does the state continue to so zealously defend the situation the reason is because state prosecutors typically never admit error
4701267 too bad i cant get on it it would sink

4701269 thank you queensland for your support and love for the show

4701272 this is pop culture meets nazi germany and the holocaust with an unprecedented force
4701273 i saw watchmen its fucking astounding the non disclosure agreement i signed prevents me from saying much but i can spout the following with complete joygasmic enthusiasm snyder and co have pulled it off remember that feeling of watching sin city on the big screen and being blown away by what a faithful translation of the source material it was in terms of both content and visuals triple that and youll come close to watching watchmen even alan moore might be surprised at how close the movie is to the book march cant come soon enough
4701274 whether its a racing suit versus a training suit or a new style of helmet theres always some new technological development
4701275 its a part of the world we live in but because theres so much money tied to the research and development of trying to find the next great thing its more on the radar than ever
4701276 incredibly simple no excessive stylistic plastic to add any additional weight
4701277 these shoes are more responsive than any shoes i have worn i took them out on their first test drive during an interval workout in big bear my legs felt like they were popping off the road and yet still had the support of a marathon shoe
4701278 prohibits the incorporation of any technology which will give the wearer any unfair advantage such as a spring
4701279 it doesnt return more than 100 percent of energy you put into it its not spring loaded
4701280 the fundamental difference with our technology over traditional footwear is that instead of using compressive materials such as foam the midsole is mechanical and works off of deflection not compression
4701281 its just like the battle with the oversized tennis racket or the metal driver
4701282 they were banned once too now thats all you see rules can never keep pace with technological change
4701283 you can no longer just look at a static body structure
4701284 everyone pedals a bike differently so one guy who is 6 feet tall is going to pedal a bike differently from another guy who is 6 feet we record movement we adjust the bike to maximize power and improve aerodynamics
4701285 ten years ago no one thought of wearing something like a heart rate monitor to work out
4701286 now most of my clients wear them the technology eventually trickles down to the mass market which is great
4701287 i still cant believe that we came back and won that match
4701288 but i was thinking it would be a pretty gnarly comeback if we make the comeback
4701289 i saw myself leading 9 4 10 6 11 8 you look at the score it was 6 0 and now its 7 all its hard to believe even now
4701290 you dont expect to lead 6 0 and win easily against a team like this
4701291 but they were not stopping to believe at 6 0 they were still comfortable im hoping they would get a little bit desperate but they continue playing like nothing happened
4701292 its a little easier when everyone gets the job done
4701293 you need them you hate to go through a series like we did in houston especially when we had the lead every game the last thing we want to do is overwork these starting pitchers youve got to take care of your assets
4701294 he stuck with me its a huge vote of confidence
4701295 youre going to go through your ups and downs if you dont have management and the coaches in your corner youre going to stay in the valley
4701296 all i can think of is when i hit it people arent catching it
4701297 when he hit it i was thinking that i hope this is something that can turn our season around
4701298 we know where we are but weve got a lot of young guys and maybe this is something that will give us a little motivation
4701299 this is a big pick me up for all of us
4701300 before the game he said something to me that just clicked about what i was doing when im swinging well
4701301 i went in there and i saw the ball well i felt really good
4701302 im just happy it got out winning the first game in a series is important especially against a team the caliber of the white sox
4701303 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
4701304 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
4701305 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
4701306 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
4701307 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
4701308 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
4701309 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
4701310 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
4701311 we really want to get the message out to people
4701312 i got back the standard form letter thank you for your comment
4701313 police also confirmed it has been aired to 700 people as part of the inquiry but never released publicly as part of the investigative strategy until now due to concerns that to do so would narrow the focus of the inquiry
4701314 the claremont murders were one of the great tragedies of western australia and i live in claremont its my electorate i know the families i know the effect on them and i know the effect on the surrounding community
4701315 if it can help solve those crimes i would want all television outlets to have that footage
4701316 i think particularly the families but the whole community of western australia would desperately want to see those horrific crimes solved and whoever committed those crimes locked away forever
4701317 the wizzard media player allows for unprecedented producer control and customization it incorporates all of the best features i have seen in other web video players and several that are innovative and unique
4701318 i expect a surge of content producers moving to this media player it has been my pleasure to work with wizzard in the development of a media player that exceeds my own lofty expectations it is exactly what i was looking for
4701319 its so nice when you work so hard and it comes off as soon as i was on my own i thought right im going to go for this time
4701320 i was promised some jimmy choo shoes if i won so thats one pair and my mums promised to get me another pair of christian louboutin shoes
4701321 ive got two pairs of christian louboutin shoes already i loooove shoes i want one pair for every outfit ive got well over 30 pairs but you can never have enough
4701322 i just did it for the social side of things but i just got better and better and thats fun if its not fun dont do it
4701323 they dont seem to be doing any good anymore and it appears they are upsetting some people
4701324 theres a couple of them that still like to chirp but some of them can back it up
4701325 as long as they can back it up ok this is a good group there are some big kids and theyre as good a group as ive been around
4701326 i think theyre very athletic very conscientious i think we have quite a bit of speed a lot of those young kids just have it
4701327 jermaine kearse catches the ball extremely well kavario catches the ball extremely well cody bruns catches the ball pretty good jordan polk catches the ball pretty consistently as well
4701328 all of the young guys have made a play here or there that just opened my eyes and made me think wow this guy can play
4701329 i think these next couple days it will sort itself out but weve got some pretty good ideas right now of who can do what
4701330 he has got big mitts for one theyre huge and theyre soft
4701331 hes really made some spectacular catches hes a big target hes got a long wingspan to reach balls big targets like that make quarterback accuracy a little easier
4701332 i havent been in the weight room a lot yet so i know i need to get a lot stronger
4701333 and my whole senior year i never got into a 3 point stance
4701334 obviously he brings something to the table that a lot of guys dont have hes a massive man
4701335 now we feel like we can have a presence in there that is a massive man that forces offenses to do things that they would rather not
4701336 i study those big playbooks we have man theyre like a dictionary
4701337 the first day was whew the plays were just mind blowing but im starting to understand the terms
4701338 so far yeah i do when im in there i just have to make sure i clog up my holes and stand my ground in there and not get moved
4701339 theres a guy donatell who always talks about the immovable object i need to be like that
4701340 those guys this is not to say anything about the older guys because theyre doing a good job too but those younger guys have done a great job of elevating the competition
4701341 they like to compete they like to get after it they like to challenge themselves to be first at everything that improves your practices your practice attitude and it carries over into the game
4701342 theyre getting invaluable time right now and theyre getting better each day this is really good for them out there
4701343 they make mistakes and they learn from those but they also do some good things make some great catches make some great runs make some people miss and things like that
4701344 i think the running back position is one of those positions in college football that you can be young if you have those natural instincts and great athleticism and speed
4701345 you have that ability to be a great player young
4701346 cara voc viu o que eu fiz fui l e ganhei por um cent simo voc vai ganhar por um cent simo ou vai perder por um cent simo ent o vai l e bate na parede

4701350 i think particularly the families but the whole community of western australia would desperately want to see those horrific crimes solved and whoever committed those crimes locked away forever
4701351 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
4701352 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special you of course have to be cautious but i was still very excited at the prospect of possibly having found a new species of bird

4701354 many of these children will have suffered pain and discomfort as a result of tooth decay

4701368 no thats not true i left him a note saying i was leaving i dont know why i said that at the airport its like my soul spoke the truth i wanted to come home to my husband
4701369 i was just one of wess women one in a long line of trophy brides
4701370 i want to be here with you this is my choice and my choice alone its been a long time since ive made my own choice it feels good right
4701371 the meeting got me off my ass yesterday ive wanted to come a million times a billion times ive wanted to beg you like i did when we were kids i just never had the courage
4701372 i just want to see if we can make it work
4701373 theres nothing in this world that i want more than to be your husband every single day
4701374 we were pregnant you and me i didnt tell you because i wanted to be sure remember you asked me if my breasts were bigger or if id gained weight

4701379 the company runs itself i mostly run interference for my father thats what the meeting this morning is about one of my fathers messes
4701380 ive never been with anyone who had a job so i dont really
4701381 mike finished them yesterday i was going to get more at walgreens but i talked to the pharmacist for too long but i can go right now
4701382 also i have an assistant if anyone really needs me they text
4701383 would you like me to go get some crunch berries or can you choose something from my vast selection
4701384 no its ok theres a group that estimate jobs they estimate well spend down to the gallon of gasoline what company resources will be required and how much well make from each project its a hard job really hard we have some talented people who keep us in business
4701385 they send me these projections and i look them over i run the numbers double check their numbers look at the work schedule stuff like that if it seems reasonable i send the entire thing to my father to see if he wants to do the project pretty boring i get a bunch of these every monday morning
4701386 im pretty good at budgets and numbers so this is interesting to me i never knew how companies did this kind of thing
4701387 i dont want to get in the way of your
4701388 i feel amazing you dont feel funny or sad or embarrassed
4701389 i hate leaving you but i need to take sarah out for a bit before i get ready to go would you like to come with us
4701390 of course i washed your clothes from yesterday but they arent quite dry i have sweats that might fit you
4701391 this is so not how i wanted to do this
4701392 delphie would love to see you when youre ready for company just open the door to the house ill be back soon
4701393 i think its fantastic that blackburn have given the job to an englishman and speaking to their players i know they have all enjoyed playing under him
4701394 im sure the manager knows what he needs weve only got three centre halves at the minute
4701395 he looked very good hes a big centre half who likes to play and so im sure he will bring a lot to the squad
4701396 if you dont win people forget that you played very well and people kill you
4701397 i know this you can play very well for one or two months and if you dont win then its over you are killed
4701398 the way to win the league is to achieve regular steady performance and results
4701399 my first impression of gary megson is hes a friendly guy but he screams a lot
4701400 but i suppose im getting used to screaming with the baby at home
4701401 its been a busy time but i feel ready im in a hotel so i booked my own room to make sure i sleep well
4701402 ive seen gareth grab a situation by the throat and sort it
4701403 we have to be fairer to rooney this season he is such a willing performer that you are tempted to listen to him at times
4701404 he says he can play centre half or centre midfield or in goal
4701405 ive sat down with roque and weve had a chat and the lad is happy to stay at blackburn
4701406 the community shield last sunday was a massive day for him and our whole family we were all rooting for him
4701407 we were all proud he was back wearing the shirt
4701408 he had been out for so long and it was nice he was thrown back in for a wembley showpiece game
4701409 he now knows that he is back and that he can obviously still play at that level
4701410 i personally like the attraction of playing for a club thats up against it
4701411 i could have gone elsewhere and sat on somebodys bench and been a premier league footballer for the length of that contract
4701412 i became a footballer to play at the highest level which is the premier league
4701413 everyone in the clubs pulling in the right direction weve never been closer than we are now
4701414 the owner mike ashley said how he sees the club and if we could get two or three more like coloccini on board we could do this quicker and get where we want to be
4701415 weve come a long way from the end of last season we all understand our roles
4701416 we are really looking to do the right things we might not always achieve the ambitions we have got
4701417 the proof of the pudding is always in the eating
4701418 we are interested in the american boy and we are trying to get him but that depends on a work permit so it will be a few days before we know about that
4701419 we had asked maurice if he thought there were any players in the american league whom he thought would do well and he recommended two or three players
4701420 the clubs dont own the players over there so the mls are happy to let him go
4701421 were not seeing the thousands the hundreds who streamed through in the past
4701422 i dont see the justification to spend 60 million on an area thats no longer an important crossing
4701423 this was turned down and written reasons were given to the serbian team we also allowed them to look at the video footage of the swim
4701424 although this is normally not permitted we decided to do it to be transparent and to show that we have nothing to hide
4701425 when i took the last stroke i thought i lost the race there but it turns out that was the difference

4701429 these are baseball decisions the shakeups got to come from the guys that are expected to perform melky cabrera batting ninth in our lineup is not supposed to be a difference maker in this club either way he was supposed to be able to slide right in while everybody else did their job
4701430 what we need is obviously the guys were counting on the guys that are making a significant amount of money that have significant performance levels to get the job done as expected and ill throw myself involved in that too i want to make sure im not pointing fingers were all in this thing together
4701431 its definitely good to get the opportunity to go out there and be that guy
4701432 we just felt that it was time for him to go work on some things you cant forget how young melky is
4701433 we believe that hes a much better player than a 240 hitter
4701434 the effort was there but for whatever reason it wasnt translating sometimes it can be difficult for young players to get out of a rut at this level
4701435 i cant tell you the exact date that hes going to be back but im confident that melkys a big league player and that hell get his stuff right
4701436 i have to go to triple a and work hard
4701437 i want to pitch for a long time i dont want to pitch for a year so i understand ive got to be patient
4701438 i believe richie still has good baseball in him but i believe richies an everyday player and i think it was tough what we were asking him to do
4701439 we were unable to get off the ground at all with the negotiations they did not even want to receive an offer
4701440 they made a decision and it was a different one than we would have expected
4701441 applications mr series monitors are ideal for a variety of applications use the mrs to empower your mixes in the studio or to add pro sound to your multimedia gaming or home theatre system you can even use them for a great sounding home dj rig the mr5 and mr8 monitors share the same design so they function great together too making them optimal for multiple monitor setups just add a big knob as well as surround systems for any applications where high quality sound and classic good looks are required mr monitors are the perfect fit

4701447 i think london is much more likely to the model for the games in the future
4701448 there are i think serious questions to be asked about the legacy value of some of the sites and some of the venues
4701449 i want to make sure that we can alchemize them into gold for london for 50 years to come and that is going to take some pretty crunchy work
4701450 a girlfriend gave me a date check card and said i could never be too safe she simply didnt want me to go out on a date with someone i knew nothing about its nice to have a friend who cares so much

4701468 be honest id never ever taken part in such adventure as a lottery or special games from business because of different reasons and stereotypes but you gave me an opportunity to change my opinion and hope in luck further first of all i should thank your team with great service that allows many people to connect with ease with their parents relatives friends worldwide and youre the one from the small amount of companies that running business with respect responsibility to each single customer and creative ideas which make our daily routines brighter and full of hope as in childhood

4701540 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4701541 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4701542 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4701543 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4701544 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4701545 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4701546 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4701547 ohh det r min blogg sluta l s om det inte passar
4701548 these robotic policemen wiped out all of cambridge in one day of carnage what have you got to say about that
4701549 bridges to nowhere than the one in alaska and there are more builders of such bridges than those built by alaskas defendant senator
4701550 he kissed me on the lips and then he gave me a filterless cigarette
4701551 i came over all light headed and had to sit on his dressing room steps
4701552 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4701553 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4701554 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4701555 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4701556 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4701557 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4701558 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4701559 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4701560 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4701561 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
4701562 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4701563 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4701564 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4701565 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4701566 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4701567 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4701568 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4701569 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4701570 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4701571 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4701572 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4701573 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4701574 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4701575 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4701576 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4701577 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4701578 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4701579 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4701580 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4701581 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4701582 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4701583 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4701584 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4701585 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4701586 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4701587 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4701588 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4701589 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4701590 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4701591 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4701592 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4701593 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4701594 recycling is recycling glass should be included its not about making money its about making difference
4701595 i realize that the problems are huge and daunting but i dont believe theres anything that cant be fixed as long as everyone is pulling in the same direction
4701596 i love challenges i love complex issues and problems and this certainly met all that
4701597 i wanted to know that i would have the ability to call the shots
4701598 basically said youre the publisher and ceo its yours to run and that was pretty much it
4701599 one of the questions i asked sam was are you going to keep this
4701600 no intention of changing the editor of the los angeles times
4701601 hell meet you once and he wont forget your name he wont forget what you do and hell care about all of that
4701602 its a very refreshing way for a senior leader to be
4701603 the market conditions were the driving force behind it not happening
4701604 those guys are very bright guys if they couldnt get it done im not sure who couldve
4701605 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4701606 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4701607 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4701608 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4701609 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4701610 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4701611 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4701612 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4701613 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4701614 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4701615 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4701616 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4701617 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4701618 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4701619 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4701620 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4701621 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4701622 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4701623 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4701624 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4701625 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4701626 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4701627 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4701628 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4701629 they said the formula is gone that it was already given away
4701630 i have a hysterical feeling im so worried about not being able to feed her
4701631 i came here to get some food i have not even a penny
4701632 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4701633 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4701634 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4701635 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4701636 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4701637 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4701638 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4701639 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4701640 i just remember there was a chase scene in the forest
4701641 no i mean as if you were pitching this for television
4701642 i know exactly what you meant i have no desire to see this on tv
4701643 look for me comics are the goal in and of itself i dont want to option this for tv or film
4701644 ill bring these back to the nickelodeon development people and see what they think
4701645 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4701646 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4701647 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4701648 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4701649 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4701650 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4701651 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4701652 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4701653 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4701654 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4701655 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4701656 knowing that my dna will be immortalized for all time and that i have been chosen as one of mankinds most
4701657 im thrilled to have scott johnson on board with me
4701658 were pumped to bring exciting updates on the upcoming open world mafia game the godfather ii weve got some great exclusive looks at eas star wars the force unleashed
4701659 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4701660 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4701661 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4701662 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4701663 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4701664 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4701665 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4701666 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4701667 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4701668 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4701669 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4701670 just so you all know we did set a record
4701671 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4701672 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4701673 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4701674 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4701675 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4701676 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4701677 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4701678 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4701679 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4701680 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4701681 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4701682 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4701683 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4701684 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4701685 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4701686 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4701687 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4701688 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4701689 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4701690 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4701691 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4701692 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4701693 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4701694 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4701695 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4701696 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4701697 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4701698 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4701699 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4701700 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4701701 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4701702 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4701703 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4701704 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4701705 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4701706 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4701707 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4701708 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4701709 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4701710 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4701711 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4701712 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4701713 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4701714 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4701715 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4701716 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4701717 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4701718 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
4701719 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4701720 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4701721 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4701722 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4701723 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4701724 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4701725 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4701726 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4701727 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4701728 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4701729 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4701730 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4701731 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4701732 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4701733 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4701734 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4701735 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4701736 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4701737 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4701738 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4701739 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4701740 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4701741 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion

4701743 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4701744 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4701745 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4701746 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4701747 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4701748 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4701749 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4701750 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4701751 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4701752 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks

4701768 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4701769 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4701770 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4701771 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you

4701778 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4701779 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4701780 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4701781 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4701782 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4701783 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment

4701785 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4701786 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4701787 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4701788 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4701789 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4701790 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4701791 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years

4701805 dass klinsmann zu den bayern kommt ist nat rlich positiv f r mich
4701806 wir haben tim noch im alten jahr ein angebot gemacht es kam danach von seiner seite aber nicht zu verhandlungen wenn ein spieler aus dem erweiterten kreis der deutschen nationalmannschaft frei zu haben ist muss man mit einer solchen entwicklung rechnen wir k nnen und wollten uns in diesem fall nur in einem gewissen finanziellen rahmen bewegen
4701807 schade wir w ren den weg mit tim gerne weitergegangen aber wir m ssen diese entwicklung hinnehmen

4701811 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4701812 i always wondered what my feelings would be i feel a tremendous load off my back somebody told me years ago you judge ones character by the company you keep and im just happy to be in the company of michael phelps thats the bottom line
4701813 im so proud of what hes been able to do
4701814 i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4701815 being dragged into yet another war which we cannot afford
4701816 the tachash of moses day was a separate species and sages could not decide whether they were beasts or domestic animals and it had one horn on its forehead

4701818 i am a little sea animal yet i traversed three hundred parasangs to offer myself as food to the leviathan
4701819 i and the cat are partners but now we have nothing to eat
4701820 thou art intriguing against thy companion only that thou mayest devour her as a punishment she shall devour thee
4701821 o hashem of the world wherein have i done wrong
4701822 o thou unclean reptile thou shouldst have been warned by the example of the moon who lost a part of her light because she spake ill of the sun and what she lost was given to her opponent 170 the evil intentions thou didst harbor against thy companion shall be punished in the same way instead of thy devouring her she shall devour thee
4701823 o hashem of the world shall my whole kind be destroyed
4701824 i will take care that a remnant of thee is spared
4701825 we dont have in our terms of agreement that if you miss a day you get a credit
4701826 we just do that voluntarily because its the right thing to do
4701827 its definitely going to be the most exciting final weve had in a very long time in the mens 100
4701828 you dont want to go out there and take it for granted then youre going to mess up
4701829 is the competition is getting tired during the rounds and im working the kinks out each round im getting faster and each round theyre getting slower i dont know if thats necessarily the truth but thats what i tell myself
4701830 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4701831 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4701832 they accepted the ruling because it was not the human eye making the judgment
4701833 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4701834 there is no doubt the question was for him to share or not to share first place there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps
4701835 in the old days the judges ruled now its the timers
4701836 technology is also imperfect the hand is quicker than the eye
4701837 they couldnt believe phelps got there and im sure ill feel the same way
4701838 there hasnt really been an error in the timing system that ive ever heard of the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first
4701839 im not about fighting it im not angry at all

4701849 i think phelps is very very good but you cant judge these things just on the number of medals people in australia say ian thorpes our greatest olympian because hes won five medals but dawn fraser couldve won 10 gold medals
4701850 to lisas e mail address and sends a message to this customized e mail address
4701851 on the surface it looks like were going to air it out
4701852 but we want to control the game and we have kids with capabilities to strike
4701853 the focal point on offense will start with cole and peni makaafi
4701854 if we can get solid play from that position and some depth at defensive tackle we should be a solid defense
4701855 we hope to improve on forcing turnovers third down defense and become a better tackling team
4701856 i feel the kids need that the terminology and the technique will remain pretty much consistent with what theyve done in the past
4701857 in addition to chepuis zane mendenhall will start at a linebacker spot and brandon smith has the ability to be one of the better cornerbacks in the state
4701858 we have to take care of the ball on offense and be tough defensively
4701859 whos in your circle but not so much that are they there for a mere season or for the long run
4701860 i dont care if theyre young im going to play the best players
4701861 we will use so many backs in and out of the game
4701862 every team has those goals such as winning a state title going into the season
4701863 but when you think about long term goals you have to take it week by week right now were looking forward to playing timpanogos
4701864 defensive wise overall we have good quickness and should be able to hopefully mix up our fronts
4701865 i think were going to be more balanced with the run and pass
4701866 thats going to help us to force teams to prepare to play multiple attacks
4701867 they almost look at last years success with disdain its not something they take ownership of
4701868 they dont want to be known as the class after the 2007 champs its not the legacy they want to leave i think eventually theyll feel proud but right now they want nothing to do with last season
4701869 to build a successful football program there needs to be a comprehensive approach to the sport
4701870 there needs to be a consistent philosophy you have to be consistent or theyll see right through you
4701871 some are looking at a three peat and to me the goal this year is to get through each practice our players expecct success but its something they have to work for
4701872 if you look at those really good programs youll notice all the coaches they know how to do things together
4701873 at some point we have to knock the wall down
4701874 we need to get to the final four the teams ahead of us teams like bingham and layton have all gotten better so we will need to play very well this season to be successful
4701875 i dont think our expectation is any different than other teams in the state
4701876 we certainly understand how challenging our region is which is great which is fine
4701877 we want to compete with the best and we have some of the best teams in the state in our region
4701878 we live and die by triple option we run that system and we run it well
4701879 our goal is go get him 5 6 touches a game
4701880 ive been a working member of sag for 35 years now and i can testify to the ongoing ethnic and cultural barriers in the entertainment industry
4701881 as a freshman theatre major at northwestern university a professor questioned my interest in acting when there was only the king amp i and flower drum song essentially saying i couldnt make it as an actor because i was asian american
4701882 its second nature to him those are things you cant teach
4701883 nobody dominates the league year in and year out i dont know if i can think of a team thats won it back to back
4701884 all the teams are very diverse park city has great speed wasatch has great size up front union is tough and uintah is much better than people give it credit for you gotta play every game
4701885 they both have high football iqs and they will be very important to our team this season
4701886 my pressure is that i want them to compete and be successful and that theyre buying into what i preach as far as the pressure of losing sleep at night no footballs a fun game and i believe in what i teach and live by what i teach
4701887 we do a little bit of everything we dont have a base line
4701888 so ybarra when are you going to come out to peru and marry me
4701889 sometimes when she couldnt sleep she played the what if game
4701890 separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword
4701891 i guess its safe to say ive played my last game in a bulls uniform
4701892 im definitely not taking it ive already expressed that to them i mean thats not an option
4701893 its a numbers game last season at the trade deadline they brought in more guards and i saw my minutes drop and didnt understand why this year the problems still the same i dont see it getting better so maybe itll be a better situation for me personally somewhere else
4701894 whats money a man is a success if he gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night and in between does what he wants to do
4701895 for nkt members to represent themselves to the public as authentic buddhist monks and nuns is wrong and misleading
4701896 buddha shakyamuni himself said that the vinaya should be practiced in accordance with what is most acceptable for society the nkt is following this advice from buddha
4701897 buddha shakyamuni himself said that the vinaya should be practiced in accordance with what is most acceptable for society
4701898 one bhikkhu cannot effect any changes since vinaya decisions are arrived at after the consultation of a sangha
4701899 however when the monks want to amend even certain minor precepts they would have to do it with the sanction of a recognized sangha council individual monks are not at liberty to change any vinaya rules according to their whims and fancies such a council of sangha members can also impose certain sanction against monks who have committed serious violations of the disciplinary code and whose behavior discredits the sangha the buddha instituted the council to help monks to prevent evil deeds and avoid temptation in a worldly life the rules were guidelines rather than inviolable laws handed down by some divine authority
4701900 as long as the complete vinaya the supreme treasure abides the lamp of dharma shall abide
4701901 there is the case where a bhikkhu says this in the blessed ones presence have i heard this in the blessed ones presence have i received this this is the dhamma this is the vinaya this is the teachers instruction
4701902 keep in mind a monastic community is not the same as a country
4701903 the dalai lamas expensive buddhist teachings on the four noble truths inspire a riot in nyc
4701904 at a time when the majority of monks from lhasas three largest monasteries are in prison or detention camps and possibly being tortured it shouldnt be hard to understand why some tibetan buddhists might be infuriated by the shugden protesters as his holinesss radio city audience was the shugden cult is undermining the fragile coherence of the tibetan diaspora and the future of tibetan buddhism itself and for what
4701905 the dalai lamas expensive buddhist teachings on the four noble truths inspire a riot in nyc
4701906 demonstrators evacuated by police after mob of thousands of hostile dalai lama supporters surrounds them
4701907 if this intense reaction and mob mentality is the result when a few people publicly question the dalai lamas actions on american soil with police present and western laws imagine how difficult it is for these people to speak up against their unelected leader in the tibetan community in exile
4701908 i am no longer a gelong that i am the same as a layman
4701909 you dont have to tell me that i am completely pure
4701910 if it shugden were a real protector it should protect the people there may not be any protector such as this which needs to be protected by the people is it proper to disturb the peace and harmony by causing conflicts unleashing terror and shooting demeanous words in order to please the dharmapala does this fulfill the wishes of our great masters try to analyze and contemplate on the teachings that had been taught in the lamrim stages of path lojong training of mind and other scriptural texts does devoting time in framing detrimental plots and committing degrading act which seems no different from the act of attacking monasteries wielding swords and spears and draining the holy robes of the buddha with blood fulfill the wishes of our great masters
4701911 the mahayana teachings advocate an altruistic attitude of sacrificing few for the sake of many
4701912 now you listen to me what i have to say and you report it to lama gangchen
4701913 if i give a weapon to my neighbour and he shoots someone this is his responsibility not my responsibility
4701914 why i said you shes not lama and even she is not nun because she never ordinate properly with pure linage and she always liar with her student i am this im that its so pure and im very high reincarnation you can forget about all this talks i knew from last year in front of protector it is rally reincarnation or not when we went to lama gangchens birthday in italy she is really not proper dhrama teacher and shes using dharma tolls and deceiving people there in germany it is really pretty they are many good monks and nuns but they are all under control of her i think you know better then me and its very long story and i must stop here many greetings and best wishes for you and all of our friends from g
4701915 the harmful teacher is one of bad temperament of little pure vision great in dogmatism he holds his own view as highest praises himself and denigrates others
4701916 a fish in front of a person is rotting and is tightly wrapped with kusha grass if that package is not moved for a long time the kusha itself also becomes like that like that kusha grass by following the sinful teacher you will always become like him
4701917 as the chief among the obstructors bar du gcod pa of all virtuous qualities is the sinful teacher one should abandon being associated with him speaking with him or even being touched by his shadow
4701918 i learned my lesson and i am deeply grateful to his holiness the dalai lama he was brave enough to make this shugden issue public and advising against it this saved my spiritual lifes
4701919 although we wish for happiness our ignorance leads us to engage in non virtuous actions which are the main cause of all our suffering also if we do not cultivate and maintain a good heart our selfish motivation destroys harmony and good relationships with others we have no inner peace and no chance to gain pure happiness without inner peace outer peace is impossible
4701920 especially nyingmapas and kayguepas fear shudgen worship and reject it
4701921 most of the nyingmas kagyues and sakyas believe that shugden is a demonic force if you practice it you will first get many disciples then many money and then many problems
4701922 unlike in nkt where all people have to accept and to follow what their single
4701923 i have meditated and considered my decision to put aside the shugden at length in my soul and spirit before coming to the right decision
4701924 during the worst of crisis mey was almost closed by the police and a sojong at lachi was delayed for 4 hours by the police some in riot geat
4701925 how many years of school does it take to be patient account specialist
4701926 based on comments in this matchs profile i am not interested in this match
4701927 if youve heard of gears or browserplus chances are youve heard them positioned as competitors in one way or another another google vs yahoo showdown truth is thats not the case at all or at least doesnt have to be after taking a look at what these technologies actually offer we can see that theyre actually two distinct approaches to an exciting new direction for the web
4701928 as long as the complete vinaya the supreme treasure abides the lamp of dharma shall abide
4701929 when i have entered into nirvana it will be your teacher
4701930 most often what is forgotten is forgotten because it no longer fits in with the current version of events especially one constructed by an elite group sometimes indeed unwelcome memories are systematically destroyed by leaderships coney 1997 the nkt is a religious movement in which the dynamics of history construction as outlined by coney are well exemplified multiple histories exist on an individual and public group level both inside and outside the movement as the pre history of the group is rooted in conflict and schism the social organisation of memory and forgetfulness especially the groups leadership is particularly striking accounts of current and former members either reinforce or contradict and compete with each other they diverge widely over points of historical detail and often interpret the same events and processes in very different ways reflecting a wide range of personal experience depth of involvement bias opinion and loyalty at the level of public discourse the history and identity of the nkt has also during the course of its development undergone considerable realignment of course such revision and reconfiguration of the past is commonplace within religious movements that are more concerned with issues of identity and ideology than with notions of historical veracity
4701931 usurped the fpmt centre and made it his own nkt
4701932 differed in one important respect only geshe kelsangs general programme included courses on tantric buddhism and attendance upon these required the reception of a tantric empowerment
4701933 in 1991 through the successful exploitation of a legal loophole the assets of manjushri institute finally fell under the sole control of the priory group
4701934 in h chst bedauerlicher weise hat sich der schlecht beratene bundespr sident villiger diese falsche auffassung zu eigen gemacht und an der ausserordentlichen sitzung der vereinigten bundesversammlung zum 50 jahrestag des kriegsendes in europa am 7 mai 1995 erkl rt dass wir mit dieser politik gegen ber den verfolgten juden schwere schuld auf uns geladen haben mit der einf hrung des judenstempels kam deutschland entgegen der bundesrat bedauert das zutiefst er entschuldigt sich daf r im wissen darum dass solches versagen letztlich unentschuldbar ist
4701935 inflicting terrible human rights abuses on his own people and interfering with the religious freedom of thousands and thousands of people around the world
4701936 pretended to be a buddhist holy being giving buddhist teachings
4701937 to give freedom to practice dorje shugden to whoever wishes to rely upon this deity to stop completely the discrimination between shugden people and non shugden practitioners to allow all shugden monks and nuns who have been expelled from their monasteries and nunneries to return to their monasteries and nunneries where they should receive the same material and spiritual rights as the non shugden practitioners
4701938 the true creator of all these problems is the dalai lama
4701939 to reverse the expulsion of the six monks and allow them to return to sera monastery where they should receive the same spiritual and material rights as the other monks who do not follow shugden
4701940 during the recent teachings in drepung by his holiness the dalai lama his holiness mentioned the issue of shugden a number of times and this time there was much more concern around the issue his holiness the dalai lama said geshe dorje damdrul was translating the government of china is funding lamas who support shugden in order to create difficulties for me especially they the chinese government give financial support to these lamas if they cultivate shugden china is very critical of me and the indian government is being pushed against me by saying that his holiness the dalai lama is restricting religious freedom by saying you cannot practice shugden it is my duty to warn people and then it is up to the individual to decide so i am not restricting religious freedom his holiness spoke a lot about the issue and as in the past explained his reasons for taking this stand his holiness has asked for a referendum among the tibetans regarding 2 questions 1 do you want to practice shugden 2 do you want to be a part of a community sharing facilities materials doing dharma activity together where some of the community practice shugden this a concern especially in the monasteries where some monks still practice if the vote is more than 60 yes on both then his holiness the dalai lama said he will not even speak one word on the subject again
4701941 sending out glossy leaflets to selected buddhists publicising protests on various websites giving interviews and sending letters to buddhist organisations
4701942 ugly attacks on esteemed tibetan teachers of buddhism the dalai lama lama yeshe died 1984 lama zopa lama namkhai norbu rinpoche and 5 other individuals
4701943 the dalai lama said he had not advocated a ban but he had stopped the worship of the spirit because it was not buddhist in nature the protesters said they wanted to discuss the issue with the dalai lama the exiled tibetan leader said people were free to protest and it was up to individuals to decide
4701944 the group had not made any formal request to meet the dalai lama or his representatives
4701945 after i read more about it i realized my mistake and dropped my practice
4701946 i think 99 percent of tibetans follow my practice some small portion worship this spirit i am committed to freedom of speech freedom of talk so i say to them enjoy freedom of talk
4701947 theres no suppression his holiness made it very clear that according to his own observations over many years in fact he himself used to worship shugden and over many years of his own experience and observation and investigation he found that this practice is not according to buddhist practice that practice is also bringing in divisions within the buddhist traditions the practitioners are attaching more importance than the basic buddhist practice and therefore he felt that its a practice that he would not approve of and therefore he advised people to not engage in it but he made it very clear right from the beginning it was up to the individuals he has a responsibility to explain the negative aspects of it and then its up to the individuals to decide on their own officially there has never been any repression or denial of rights to practitioners but after his holiness advice many monastic orders adopted rules and regulations that would not accept practitioners of shugden worship in their monastic order the followers have set up their own groups and they are free to function but its in the right of institutions to make their own decisions
4701948 theres some misunderstanding that groups taking their own actions is the policy of the tibetan government but its not institutions take advice and it is within their right to say they do not want shugden worship but now if a group of people say they want to set up their own institution because they are different practitioners which is within their right
4701949 shugden practitioners deny that they are fundamentalist purist or violent and have renewed their complaints in light of an intensifying crackdown by the dalai lama
4701950 there is considerable anecdotal evidence to support what they say
4701951 buddhist monks who apply for an identity certificates must also submit a letter form their abbot i was told that there may have been cases in which contrary to the policy of the government in exile monks who worship shugden have not been provided with such a letter
4701952 therefore in the spirit of dharma and in accordance with buddhist principles the asa would encourage the nkt and wss protesters to request forgiveness from the dalai lama for their behaviour and in future to conduct themselves with humility and restraint
4701953 that for nkt members to represent themselves to the public as authentic buddhist monks and nuns is wrong and misleading
4701954 nkt monks and nuns are authentic and try to show a good and practical example of service celibacy and humility for our modern world buddha shakyamuni himself said that the vinaya should be practiced in accordance with what is most acceptable for society the nkt is following this advice from buddha
4701955 nowadays in tibetan buddhism in practice many of these are broken from the day the vows are taken we should appreciate that the nkt is acting honestly in accordance with this reality following the truth they are not pretending to be lofty or important simply by collecting a large number of vows that are subsequently not possible for a modern day practitioner to keep
4701956 we are genuinely sorry for those mistakes and trying honestly to learn from them
4701957 sera me has expelled 180 monks 80 from nepal and 100 from the same area in tibet that the former zong rinpoche came from they have left the monastery and have formed their own monastery just outside sera they are being supported financially by the usual lot from europe and the chinese government
4701958 they had to issue warnings to about a hundred monks but ended up having to expel only a handful
4701959 even during the initial stick referendum the supporters of hh dalai lama won by a large margin
4701960 crossing a remarkable line the global nkt cult has created a web site attacking 8 other buddhists
4701961 so why is the fpmt attacking us it can only be because fpmt members have become a political tool of the dalai lamas to fulfill his wish to destroy this tradition
4701962 traditionally competitive to the nkt that pretends to be uninvolved in attacking the nkt but has its fingerprints all over the smear campaign on the web
4701963 a great deal of anguish among a large number of tibetans and the followers of several prominent lamas who spread the dharma to thousands of non tibetans around the world
4701964 is forcing almost all of the gelugpa lamas who have spread the dharma to the west to break their vow and commitments to either to his holiness or to their root guru who is also the root guru of his holiness kyabje trijang rinpoche
4701965 we have waited long enough for us to pass this economic wilderness but as long as these talks drag on it can only mean worse things to come
4701966 going to work has become a waste of time as we still dont know anything about what the politicians are talking about or whether these talks will better our lives
4701967 ever since we voted in march life has become increasingly difficult and if these men the political leaders do not reach any agreement soon life for us will only get worse
4701968 i cannot afford basics like bread or meat for my children and cannot afford to send them to school we only hope the quick resolution of the crisis will mean a better life for our children
4701969 the political crisis has always been intertwined with the economy therefore if there is no immediate agreement on the salient issues that all negotiating parties have tabled then zimbabweans can only watch and pray as things get worse
4701970 it is true that in any negotiations one must be prepared to bend backwards a bit but zimbabwes crisis appears to be very intricate as there is still strong belief among the countrys founding fathers that the opposition mdc wants to return the country to whites
4701971 what has worsened the situation for zimbabweans is that they do not know what the parties involved are talking about because of the media blackout imposed on the negotiating teams but it is the peoples fate being discussed so people should really have a right to know
4701972 no one wants to stay here people are leaving in their numbers because they have lost faith in the talks

4701978 it seems extraordinary to imagine that four us agents whod gone to pick her up two military two fbi along with at least two afghan translators were somehow surprised by this woman who overpowered them grabbed a gun flipped the safety fired off a couple of shots and then could only be subdued by shots to the torso
4701979 if the story suggested by the us government is accurate it paints a very unflattering picture of the competence of forces who are literally on the frontlines of the war on terror
4701980 if the us story is not true then were looking at a serious breach of us and international law when a prisoner in custody is shot
4701981 of course they found all this stuff on her it was planted on her she is the ultimate victim of the american dark side

4702016 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4702017 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened

4702030 but when were down 6 0 it was like ok this is going to be a pretty gnarly comeback if were coming back from this
4702031 i take the time out at 6 2 and i believe we are going to make a side out to get to 7 2
4702032 i see myself leading 9 4 10 5 12 6 its an easy end of the set normally
4702033 down 6 0 and storming back to 7 7 and then winning
4702034 i dont know if ive ever seen anything like that

4702043 it was a strange sort of a day we were playing a pro40 game and there was a lot of talk and some great names mentioned me it almost made my career thats something ill take on board and realise a lot more when i have finished playing the game ill look back and think that some of the greatest names in the game were saying i had a decent cricket brain
4702044 weve played a lot against essex this might be our sixth game against them in one day cricket this year
4702045 theyve got some players who can ruin your day just as we have ravi bopara and our joe denly are probably the best two young players in the country and graham napier is on the crest of a wave
4702046 probably one of the best anyone has ever had in the domestic one day game but unless youre banging out 2 000 runs in the championship one day cricket always gets overlooked hes at a stage where hes not going to play for his country hes just got county cricket and hes very driven

4702101 a piledriver would have been if i had thrown him into the ground straight down
4702102 id done it in training so i kind of knew it was a show move i always thought if i ever get the chance to use something like that in a fight the fans would like it at the same time though its only worth doing if its going to be effective and practical in a fight its a good thing for the fans to see i guess
4702103 the first point deduction was a mistake on my part knee to a downed leites face but the second one punch to the back of the head was a bit unfair
4702104 i felt i shouldve finished him after that anyway so the result was sort of my fault i was pretty happy with my performance on the whole though
4702105 i feel like i won the leites fight and to be honest my fight with kampmann kind of shows that the ufc thinks i won the fight too
4702106 kampmanns pretty much undefeated and hes beaten thales before in my opinion kampmanns a step up from leites and im happy to have the opportunity to face him
4702107 kampmann defeated leites and a win over him would kind of put the stamp on the fight i had with leites
4702108 the loss doesnt matter to me now kampmanns undefeated apart from a cuts loss and im all about taking on the best guys out there nobodys really shown a way to beat him yet
4702109 i feel like im better than him in every area
4702110 i feel like my standups better my wrestlings better and my ground game is definitely very well rounded and tough to deal with when it comes to the fight im going to apply everything i know to beat him i think i have more tools than him
4702111 id say hes more well rounded and has better technique in his stand up than leites but i dont think hell be as strong or perhaps as dangerous on the ground as thales theyre two different kind of fighters kampmanns very technical and a pretty good finisher but i dont feel hes ever been in with a fighter like me
4702112 ever since i fought for the title my mentality has been a little bit different im stronger mentally now and dont look to put any pressure on myself to perform i just go out there and do it now i go into every fight just expecting to do my best as long as i go out and do my best im going to win each and every time i dont have that oh this is my last fight kind of pressure i dont do that to myself
4702113 he fought me in more of a sparring mode now when i go out there im trying to hurt the opponent and take him out back then i was trying to win the fight but not looking to over commit i was holding back im never going to hold back again to be a great fighter you have to improve after your defeats if you cant improve from a loss youre only going one way and thats downhill
4702114 i hope he hangs onto that belt so i can get up there and take it from him i see holes in his game and i want to be the one to expose them i dont want someone getting there first and taking all the credit
4702115 i respect him of course hes a great fighter and a great finisher when he sees his opportunity he chases after it and takes it thats what im learning to do now its taken a loss to silva to teach me that kind of stuff

4702118 i think when you are two goals down against bayern munich its almost a miracle to get a draw
4702119 i have got to say we did really well and after the game we can be very happy
4702120 of course i would have preferred a three point start to the season but i would say the result is fair
4702121 both sides had several chances to score more goals and i am a bit disappointed but we have a point and can now build on that next week
4702122 when you are 2 0 up then you have got to make sure you win the game no matter how you do it
4702123 we are getting a step further each day but we have had a lot of setbacks and it is normal that we are not working as a unit right from the start

4702126 the idea is to put on the field to play our game in a way that is as similar as brazilian football as we can but i have players who are made for english football their characteristics are different
4702127 we will try to learn about dribbling controlling the ball passing the ball touching the ball and one twos but i need to respect the identity of the players and the quality of the players we have some players who play similar to those in brazil but others dont
4702128 abramovich wants chelsea to play very well and win the fans are the same its not just mr abramovich
4702129 but they need to understand that sometimes it is difficult to play beautifully and win sometimes it is impossible because the other team plays a different style
4702130 it is my style and i have been a coach now for 24 25 years i try to play very well and win but if you dont win people forget that you played very well people kill you you can play very well for one or two months then you dont win then its over

4702137 from time to time rumors circulate that thimerosal a mercury based preservative once used in several vaccines and still used in some flu vaccine could contribute to asds however valid scientific studies have shown there is no link the american academy of pediatrics aap the american medical association ama the cdc and the institute of medicine iom agree that science does not support a link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism
4702138 the author concludes that recent studies have found no association between mmr vaccination and autism the frequent embryologic neuroanatomic abnormalities found in children with autism lessen the likelihood that mmr immunization is a major risk factor the immunization safety review committee of the institute of medicine and a special american academy of pediatrics panel have concluded that evidence does not support mmr immunization as a risk factor for autism
4702139 on may 18th 2004 the institute of medicine iom released its eighth and final report from its immunization safety review committee based on a thorough review of clinical and epidemiological studies neither the mercury based vaccine preservative thimerosal nor the measles mumps rubella mmr vaccine are associated with autism says the new report furthermore the hypotheses regarding how the mmr vaccine and thimerosal could trigger autism lack supporting evidence and are theoretical only further research to find the cause of autism should be directed toward other lines of inquiry that are supported by current knowledge and evidence and offer more promise for providing an answer said the committee that wrote the report the american medical association ama lauds the process that went into the creation of this scientific report and applauds the iom and the cdc for their strong efforts in continuing to ensure the safety of the vaccines that are administered in the u nited states through post market surveillance and studies such as this
4702140 some people believe increased exposure to thimerosal from the addition of important new vaccines recommended for children explains the higher prevalence in recent years
4702141 the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal containing vaccines and autism
4702142 those views run contrary to all of the scientific evidence to date
4702143 run contrary to all of the scientific evidence to date
4702144 the government has made absolutely no statement indicating that vaccines are a cause of autism
4702145 this does not represent anything other than a very specific situation and a very sad situation as far as the family of the affected child
4702146 this is also not a normal court of law so i am not sure if
4702147 give people information that is not being controlled by the central government and let them make their own decisions
4702148 science thrives on errors cutting them away one by one false conclusions are drawn all the time but they are drawn tentatively hypotheses are framed so they are capable of being disproved a succession of alternative hypotheses is confronted by experiment and observation science gropes and staggers toward improved understanding pseudoscience is just the opposite hypotheses are often framed precisely so they are invulnerable to any experiment that offers a prospect of disproof so even in principle they cannot be invalidated practitioners are defensive and wary skeptical scrutiny is opposed when the pseudoscientific hypothesis fails to catch fire with scientists conspiracies to suppress it are deduced
4702149 if parents believe that vaccines are harmful to their children what right does any government have to force them to be inoculated

4702157 its not a huge number of students who use cal grants

4702163 its something the schools dont provide anymore because of liability issues tumbling trampoline pommel horse its all gone at schools these days
4702164 when youve got a story like michael phelps hes that once in a lifetime athlete you are lucky to see participate
4702165 i dont think it can do anything but increase interest
4702166 you think of all the other sports out there and the impact on the body in swimming while you have to be fit and work your way up it is an amazing amazing workout

4702172 livestock production is one of the major causes of the worlds most pressing environmental problems including global warming land degradation air and water pollution and loss of biodiversity using a methodology that considers the entire commodity chain it estimates that livestock are responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions a bigger share than that of transport

4702176 siamo qui da diversi giorni ormai avrei dovuto esserci quantomeno abituato ma non cos mi stupisce sempre vedere lalba con la consapevolezza che su questa citt il cielo non diverr mai pi chiaro di quanto non sia ora
4702177 ho studiato le mappe non erano molto aggiornate ma penso andranno bene lo stesso
4702178 devo ammettere che il vecchio aveva ragione a volervi mandare con me almeno il tuo talento ci sar utilissimo per entrare nella citt evitando inutili massacri
4702179 agir questa notte quando non ci sar alcuna luce in cielo dubito che alcuno potrebbe scoprirmi ma preferisco essere prudente

4702181 non mi fido di nessuno tantomeno del vecchio ha troppi segreti per i miei gusti non vi avrebbe mandati qui con me se non presagisse un tornaconto per i suoi piani
4702182 proteggere noi vi devo ricordare il reale aspetto del mio amico senza contare il fatto che sia un potente mago e comunque il problema non si pone visto che non sono in grado di portare con me altre persone a parte davon e questo solo per via dei suoi poteri e del fatto che ci siamo allenati a lungo per riuscirci

4702187 chief we love practicing against each other in camp the competition is great and the denver nightlife weather is even better people are friendly and cops coaches actually think we are respectable young men we are turning over a new leaf er we are working hard to stay out of trouble
4702188 during the morning workout the cowboys offense when tempers flared cowboys left tackle flozell adams yanked the helmet off broncos defensive tackle marcus thomas and swung it in a threatening manner some pushing pulling and cursing followed but order was restored without any punches thrown
4702189 i won today since he changed his name back to adam hes not as good as pacman used to be
4702190 no he didnt get the best of me man they changed the route around every time no but its fun on that go route he hit it big on the comebacker he said he stuttered because i was coming up on him its one on one its an offensive drill what we do in team drills and seven on seven ill take it from there as long as im around the ball in one on one im happy with it
4702191 my dads been so strong and worked so hard for so many years to be a provider for us i have never seen him at a weak point never ever so to see him down and unconscious that hit me hard right then and there i just wanted to dedicate and put a lot of focus into getting into the best shape of my life

4702194 so its a crap shoot really take me to the brink and then see if the medicine will bring me back
4702195 this is it she wont make it through this time
4702196 only for her to bounce back once again and surprise even the medical team
4702197 you know i loved turning 40 my husband had a surprise birthday party for me which was great and although i was diagnosed with pph i was thrilled to be 40 years old
4702198 all issues can be resolved only through dialogue and peaceful means
4702199 but its definitely easier when theyre younger it gets so much harder theyre very emotional theyre a little slower you have to deal with a lot of other things when theyre younger theyre like a soldier now i have to prove it myself to her we spend more and more time on that
4702200 it wasnt easy for nastia to be second but i never believed nastia was no 2
4702201 some judges maybe like shawn but nastias level of gymnastics is high we calculate our course and come to the conclusion she is not second she just makes mistakes
4702202 this morning when i woke up i knew there wasnt anything else that could make me better
4702203 i just had to give it my all and hope it was enough
4702204 and she now knows that and after the practice im her father but its very hard for everybody im not going to hide that we had our moments credit my wife there she helps out a lot shes always mediator

4702220 our roster numbers arent real high coach mario pi a said
4702221 the key is to keep our kids healthy and focused on the season
4702222 the kids are getting used to the system pi a said
4702223 were more comfortable with it theyre able to do a little more with it
4702224 were expecting a lot of good things out of the kids said cholla coach thomas webb
4702225 theyve been working hard and weve had a good strength and conditioning program their attitudes are really good
4702226 we believe defense wins championships said webb whose team will play its home games at tucson high and pueblo while chollas field is being renovated
4702227 we believe we need to run an offense that is within our talent level
4702228 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4702229 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4702230 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4702231 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4702232 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4702233 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4702234 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4702235 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4702236 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4702237 they accepted the ruling because it was not the human eye making the judgment
4702238 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4702239 there is no doubt the question was for him to share or not to share first place there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps
4702240 in the old days the judges ruled now its the timers
4702241 technology is also imperfect the hand is quicker than the eye
4702242 they couldnt believe phelps got there and im sure ill feel the same way
4702243 there hasnt really been an error in the timing system that ive ever heard of the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first
4702244 im not about fighting it im not angry at all
4702245 people will be bringing this up for years saying you won that race
4702246 if we got to do this again i would win it
4702247 five things you dont give a about in gta iv
4702248 but this year i think im going to try and come out of my shell a little bit i want to still lead by example but we have a shot at winning state this year and if i need to speak up about something im going to do that
4702249 i look at it as a learning experience and now we have a chance to come back and do even better
4702250 hes a nightmare hes one of the best running backs weve ever faced
4702251 he should be back to around 2 000 yards passing like weve had here in the past
4702252 it has a chance to be the best o line weve ever had
4702253 im very fortunate to be where i am im excited about this season
4702254 i was happy to get back on the field last year thats for sure
4702255 j j is one of the smartest kids youll ever have on a football field
4702256 he carries a 3 9 grade point average there are very few football players that have his athletic ability those brains and get along with his teammates as well as he does
4702257 and that the relationship with his teammates that is his strength
4702258 we figured out that this was the 135th game played together for nine of these 11 girls
4702259 friday when we won it was the first time we saw them jumping up and down crying and hugging each other
4702260 when she doubled off that runner at third watching the girls reaction was so exciting
4702261 jeff scurran will turn santa rita from an 0 10 embarrassment into a class 4a division ii playoff team
4702262 southern arizona wont be shut out of a 4a or 5a state championship in 2007
4702263 that game that loss thats been on my mind probably every day since then
4702264 these guys did a good job of preparing over the summer when youre playing who we play you cant just walk out each august and start preparing then or youll get embarrassed
4702265 weve got some talented kids who look promising who we are going to build on holland said
4702266 last year point blank we didnt do that and thats as a whole top to bottom coaches and players
4702267 but with a senior line with our passing game looking good and i hit the gym hard all offseason im pretty excited about what could happen this year
4702268 i knew coming in it wasnt going to be easy
4702269 i knew moving up to 5a it was going to be pretty much a rebuilding type thing but we are excited about things the attitude of our kids is tremendous were going to have 15 freshmen on our team
4702270 we want to win our region and make the playoffs just like everyone else
4702271 this group is capable of making it to the playoffs
4702272 were going to rely more on our running backs this year
4702273 we thought we would compete last year in our first year of varsity but we had a rash of injuries
4702274 our line was young last year and we didnt score against teams when we needed to score said second year head coach jim monaco
4702275 we came up empty were looking to work on our red zone offense now that our quarterback has a year under his belt
4702276 i think the initial sense ive had here is the parents want the kids to be involved in something thats positive
4702277 every school every team has parents that put pressure on the coaches to win and succeed and i dont think thats any different here
4702278 we have a number of good athletes and the baseball players should add depth
4702279 if hunter masters the system at quarterback we should be better
4702280 i know everyone else did but along the way we realized what we were and the goal became to win a state championship when that didnt happen it wasnt the season we wanted
4702281 if people didnt like us last year theyre going to like us less this year
4702282 the times we got beat last year we got out muscled out physicalled a bit
4702283 we had too many two way players but i hate to have any studs standing beside me on the sideline when were getting it stuffed down our throats on the field
4702284 if we can stay focused on the task at hand we will be able to compete with a lot of people
4702285 the key for us is team chemistry and work ethic
4702286 those are two things that were better at this year
4702287 a new program that is focused on the fundamentals of football in an attempt to establish a foundation from the ground up that promotes honor hard work and respect for rio rico and our community
4702288 we have to play much more consistent casa grande coach tracy stuart said
4702289 we had a group that was here for two years that grabbed most of the playing time we were extremely young last year stuart said
4702290 weve gotten some great work from our linebackers and secondary stuart said
4702291 were looking for those groups to be pretty strong for us
4702292 we lost three games in the final 30 seconds of games and the hope is these guys learned from that and will learn to close out games
4702293 i think our defense is going to be pretty good this year
4702294 even though we lost some of the guys well play a fast aggressive defense and im pretty excited about our defense
4702295 we expect to battle again for a 5a division ii state championship
4702296 weve got to find a way to get those guys the ball
4702297 thats the sign of a strong program with the exception of special talents like adam hall a coach would like to start all seniors every year knowing they put in the time in the program and each senior class is full of guys who are the starters on your team for our seniors theyve put in the work and its their time right now
4702298 our top rusher is back our top passer is back our top receiver is back and we have three linemen from a year ago tucson high coach vince smith said
4702299 last year we were inconsistent and not focused smith said
4702300 if we can maintain our focus we can play with anybody we have the talent speed athleticism and experience
4702301 i dunno but it sure is a good deal lets get it
4702302 hey i was at golds gym venice beach grunt yeah more grunts
4702303 there is no doubt about the capacity of the system
4702304 you dont win with luck if it says michael phelps won then michael phelps won
4702305 we did not want them to go sleeping thinking something was lost
4702306 it was very clear the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4702307 i think if we had to do this again id win
4702308 standing next to the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4702309 every time i leave the 2 mile radius of where i live people are coming up to me
4702310 i dont want to be finished after the olympic games i would love to compete as long as my body will let me
4702311 a lot of people are in it for the money and sponsors but thats never been my goal you know to get so many sponsors or to earn this much money thats just something extra
4702312 theres maybe one or two women gymnasts that have been able to capitalise on their olympic experience and make a long term career out of and thats it
4702313 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4702314 i didnt beat phelps but perhaps im the only guy at this competition who had a shot at beating phelps one on one
4702315 i knew that i was leading the race after the first 50 i usually do and i knew that michael is fast in the second 50 and he would be chasing me
4702316 i think if we got to do this again i would win it
4702317 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4702318 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4702319 there is a gold medal at stake but i came into this expecting bronze and i did one better and got silver and almost the gold
4702320 but im taking what i got and im very happy
4702321 losing by a hundredth of a second is difficult its the hardest loss but its a complete miracle im here considering i was going to retire a year and a half ago
4702322 from my heart im enjoying it and i wish i had a gold medal but im happy with a silver
4702323 i had to help my people knowing it could be a big risk for my swimming career im proud of what i did
4702324 i had to do it to help the kosovo serbs knowing how hard it is for them there
4702325 croatia right now is playing their best water polo and for us to beat them and control this game today shows that were definitely in contention for a gold medal
4702326 well celebrate for five minutes then get ourselves ready for monday
4702327 i was a little nervous i didnt know if my legs were going to be under me
4702328 i felt a little flat the past couple of days because i cut training really drastically to just try to recuperate and give myself as much energy as possible
4702329 we all had at least one day where we werent feeling all that well
4702330 i think its maybe a combination of people brushing their teeth with the water the long travel just a bunch of things
4702331 i still dont know what happened i trained well and these things never happened before in training
4702332 wenna has improved a lot in a very short period of time so im also happy to see her succeed
4702333 i was a little nervous i didnt know if my legs were going to be under me
4702334 i felt a little flat the past couple of days because i cut training really drastically to just try to recuperate and give myself as much energy as possible
4702335 we all had at least one day where we werent feeling all that well
4702336 i think its maybe a combination of people brushing their teeth with the water the long travel just a bunch of things

4702342 all have been checked by medical staff and are well with no injuries

4702345 i wish we could get robots involved instead of people
4702346 i didnt sleep a lot i was just lying in bed waiting for my race i hope to go quicker tomorrow
4702347 my swim was good tomorrow is another race i know im in contention but so is everybody else its all close out there
4702348 in one blow russia has managed to do something it had not done for years which is to assert its role as the regional security manager after seeing that role dissipate from the mid 1990s
4702349 the russians feel they have been treated like dirt by the world for the last 20 years
4702350 will the russians be prepared to intervene again if there is an ethnic conflict involving russians in ukraine or if they cant agree with kiev about their lease on sevastopol the black sea port the russian navy is due to vacate in 2017
4702351 will now swallow hard before making any attempt to recover their own separatist areas
4702352 from the mid 1990s until now every time russian power and influence has been tested around the periphery of the old soviet space russia has been found wanting
4702353 putin could not stop the baltic states joining the eu and nato he could not do anything about the pro western orange revolution in ukraine and the rose revolution in georgia and he couldnt manage the presidential successions in turkmenistan and kyrgyzstan the way moscow would have in the past
4702354 the cis turned out to be a good vehicle for managing an amicable divorce and disentangling the soviet union but it was much less successful as a vehicle for economic integration and cementing russias influence
4702355 what happened in south ossetia is to a large extent on their conscience
4702356 we warned about the danger of arming the georgian leadership for many years and drew the attention of our us partners among others to the fact that the program they had started to arm and train the georgian army could lead to a situation like this
4702357 i did not even know what it was all about
4702358 for the last month i have been training all alone
4702359 i know some of my teammates have fallen ill and it just happened that they couldnt make it here
4702360 im not sure whats going on i barely saw any of my teammates before i came so i dont know anything about it
4702361 i think it is just frustrating to find that such type of cheating planned cheating is still going on
4702362 obviously the others had more experience than i have me but i was fortunate today i do feel lucky
4702363 i want to thank god for the opportunity to be in five olympic games and to end my career like this
4702364 silver is not bad but silver is silver sometimes i heard an athlete say silver tasted like gold but to me silver is silver and bronze is bronze
4702365 its an issue probably an issue in one country we know what country
4702366 i guess theyre trying to do the best they can the testers youve just got to hope for the best for the people that are clean
4702367 it was strange maybe they were dodging it a bit because theyre under a bit of pressure with the accusations that have been going around
4702368 i saw the finish on the big screen after the race and then i saw it slowed down frame by frame at the massage area
4702369 i was looking at the computer and its almost too close to see one one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport its pretty cool
4702370 it would be good for the sport if he lost
4702371 im sure people will be bringing this up for years saying that you know you won that race
4702372 is michael phelps the gold medal winner i think if we had to do this again id win
4702373 if anybody wants to say anything ill always welcome it i like it it definitely motivates me even more
4702374 both of us have metallic goggles so i couldnt see his eyes and he couldnt see mine
4702375 i really thought that cost me the race but it happened to be the direct opposite
4702376 if i would have glided i would have ended up being way too long i ended up making the right decision trying to just take sort of a short fast stroke to try to get my hand on the wall first it turned out to be in my favor
4702377 it seems like every day im in sort of a dream world
4702378 sometimes you sort of have to pinch yourself to see if its really real im just happy im in the real world
4702379 we have set up scores of watch towers and have cameras placed in open areas crossroads and major entrances

4702387 it feels like im at the epicenter of the biggest financial crisis in history
4702388 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4702389 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4702390 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4702391 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4702392 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4702393 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4702394 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4702395 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4702396 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4702397 the story behind the job numbers is that the states economic weakness is spilling outside of real estate
4702398 some people are still debating whether the nation is in a recession
4702399 people are just having a tough time finding a job
4702400 but its the kind of work where you cant wake up one morning and say hey today i want to be a nurse
4702401 when prices finally stabilize that will remove a lot of uncertainty
4702402 our resolution does not contain the way serbia sees the unilateral declaration of independence
4702403 we dont want to put countries of the world in a situation to vote for our point of view or for anybody elses point of view we ask the support for this thing to be referred to the international court of justice
4702404 i can say that serbia is going to accept any opinion that comes from the icj
4702405 i think this is the way forward that has to be supported by opponents and supporters of kosovos independence alike
4702406 i think we should all come together in supporting international law
4702407 this has been a negotiation between close allies and friends and while there have naturally been ups and downs throughout that entire process ive been gratified that we have both delegations that is to say have approached this in the spirit of trying to do something that was important for both countries securities and as allies and friends
4702408 what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations but by the same token my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4702409 i accuse the government of russia of deliberate policy of ethnic cleansing and i can prove it with international organizations already bringing testimony to what im saying and weve received 1 400 reports of brutal attacks slaughters rapes and internment of people in violation of rules of geneva conventions and international humanitarian law
4702410 the israeli report on the killing of fadel has grown fears among palestinian journalists covering the conflict with israel in the gaza between the palestinians and the israelis in the gaza strip about the mission you know the mission to cover and to film and we have been hearing from all other colleagues that they are not certain they are not sure about their lives anymore after such a report which makes clear that the mere raising of a camera in the street in a refugee camp or near the border can put someones life in danger
4702411 in this incident on april 16th six civilians were killed by flechette darts a weapon that is illegal that should not be being used in these conditions in the gaza strip and one of the six was a journalist
4702412 its an historic opportunity and i think it hearkens back to the values people had when the wilderness act was first published in 1964
4702413 an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man where man himself is a visitor who does not remain
4702414 were very concerned with this big mass push for wilderness thats going on right now
4702415 there are better choices in todays world for protecting that land and preserving the access thats so needed for recreation
4702416 chose to ignore wilderness proposals even when there was a great deal of consensus in support of them
4702417 to ensure that the land is preserved as god intended
4702418 government agencies should pause and reflect on the significance of this verdict
4702419 hoped this will prevent other taxpayers from going through the same nightmare that i have had to endure for over a decade
4702420 as far as i know and ive been around a long time there has never been an award of tort damages against the franchise tax board in any kind of audit
4702421 they ftb auditors made this into a vendetta on their part and it backfired big time
4702422 ive got better things to do than to take on other people
4702423 but when ive got to i defend myself i will never submit to blackmail or extortion
4702424 the decision to continue litigating mr hyatt has already proved an epic disaster to california
4702425 i asked fox if i could do it and they said go for it
4702426 this is what i wanted to work at the highest level and theres nothing bigger in broadcasting than network tv in new york
4702427 we have positioned ourselves as sustainable designers and now its a matter of walking the talk
4702428 you can bring people in and say this is exactly what it will look like
4702429 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action
4702430 we bid farewell to a star whom we loved to the point of adoration after the 9th of august was a bright day in the palestinian culture and history and humanity when this stubborn knight stepped away from poetry and literature to leave in us a sun that does not set and a river that does not stop flowing with goodness and humanity and hope
4702431 were extremely disappointed this report appears to condone the use of deadly force in a situation where the soldiers could not be and admit they were not certain of what they were looking at we believe that there were grounds for them to realize that they were looking at a journalist this puts us in the position where journalists cannot raise a camera in the presence of israeli soldiers without the risk of being fired on and we find that unacceptable and were going to be discussing with the israeli officials how we can improve the safety of our journalists in the future
4702432 we are not sure of a motive right now for the shooting or what caused it or if he was looking for any particular person thats something detectives will be determining we have approximately fifteen to twenty witnesses that we are interviewing but right now thats about all we are willing to release at this point until such time as we find out the condition of the suspect as well as a possible motive
4702433 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4702434 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4702435 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4702436 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4702437 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4702438 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4702439 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4702440 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4702441 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4702442 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4702443 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4702444 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4702445 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4702446 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4702447 as soon as he russell started to scramble i worked outside and figured hed try to come to me because we were down by the end zone and i felt like we had a good connection
4702448 my first start me and zach hooked up for like eight passes
4702449 i think hes a great athlete and he has a knack for getting open and once you put it in his vicinity hes going to catch it
4702450 we went out there and did some good things and kept the ball moving
4702451 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4702452 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4702453 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4702454 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4702455 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4702456 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4702457 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4702458 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4702459 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4702460 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4702461 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4702462 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4702463 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4702464 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4702465 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4702466 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4702467 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4702468 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4702469 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4702470 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4702471 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4702472 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4702473 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4702474 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4702475 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4702476 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4702477 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4702478 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4702479 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4702480 in this hour of crisis divisive politics will lead us nowhere
4702481 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4702482 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4702483 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4702484 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4702485 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4702486 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4702487 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4702488 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4702489 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4702490 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4702491 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4702492 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4702493 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4702494 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4702495 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4702496 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4702497 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4702498 who are open to doing something on the production side
4702499 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4702500 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4702501 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4702502 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4702503 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4702504 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4702505 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4702506 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4702507 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4702508 it was very clear the serbian swimmer touched second it was an issue of stroking one was stroking the other was gliding
4702509 i had to take my goggles off to make sure the 1 was next to me
4702510 when someone says you cant do something it shows you anything is possible when you put your mind to it and focus
4702511 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4702512 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4702513 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4702514 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4702515 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4702516 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4702517 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4702518 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4702519 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4702520 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4702521 the larger the firm the larger the portfolio the more intense our effort
4702522 we have an ongoing investigation with goldman sachs in the course of investigations were also having discussions
4702523 we were surprised that new york sent us a letter threatening legal action on auction rate securities
4702524 we have been discussing this issue with new york and other regulators since we announced last week our plan to purchase our retail clients ars and we thought we were making progress we anticipated further talks
4702525 there are dozens of firms whove been involved in this area
4702526 todays agreement in principle underscores our desire to ensure that clients who purchased ars at wachovia receive the liquidity they need
4702527 when everyone else is settling there is no place to hide
4702528 if it wasnt for the secretary of state in missouri and others i dont think we would have gotten anywhere
4702529 i dealt with wachovia people until i was blue in the face and they categorically denied selling this as a money market but if they dont want to admit they did wrong shame on them
4702530 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4702531 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4702532 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4702533 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4702534 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4702535 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4702536 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4702537 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4702538 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

4702547 train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it
4702548 shown more interest in helping the todis than the young couple
4702549 the way the police handled the case was unconstitutional inhuman and against the rule book they were fed with false allegations by priyankas family which they accepted unquestioningly
4702550 it seems the police only act on complaints lodged with lalbazar
4702551 in the press conference mukherjee had suppressed the fact that he had already met pradip todi who had sought his help in breaking up the marriage he gave credence to the false allegations levelled by the todis instead of helping the couple when they had turned to police for help this encouraged his subordinates to harass the couple even more
4702552 mukherjee had shown more interest in helping the todis than the young couple
4702553 illegally by interfering in the affairs of a legally married couple
4702554 it is an inescapable conclusion that there are two police stations lalbazar police headquarters is for the influential ones and local police stations are for the aam aadmi it is disgraceful that people have to knock on the high courts door for lodging an fir
4702555 im not sure how many other countries would have either the resources or the control of the resources to be able to put them behind an event like this
4702556 i think london is much more likely to the model for the games in the future
4702557 there are i think serious questions to be asked about the legacy value of some of the sites and some of the venues
4702558 i want to make sure that we can alchemize them into gold for london for 50 years to come and that is going to take some pretty crunchy work
4702559 remember the animals in your life are not just you pets theyre your friends
4702560 iran just wants to use turkey as a transit country but turkey wants to be a partner iran is concerned about turkey becoming an energy hub
4702561 most importantly ahmadinejad has come to win some time for iran internationally in the nuclear talks
4702562 in a democratic spirit and in accordance with the constitution
4702563 let them bring the charges so far they havent brought any charges
4702564 she has a beautiful voice but there are no tracks
4702565 mostly classic jazz i cant stand rap theres no melody and you cant understand a word theyre saying
4702566 he came to visit when he played the van wezel performing arts hall in sarasota and kris kristofferson stopped by
4702567 yeah hes a jewboy from philadelphia so here we are two heebs from the north who came south to teach southerners how to play their music
4702568 i offered it to him but he said he was too fat in it
4702569 the individual performances all live up to the expectations created from the previous seasons adrien grenier continues to look cute and grow into being a movie star kevin connolly continues to keep the show in the realm of reality and believability meanwhile jerry ferrara kevin dillon and jeremy piven maintain their brilliant comedic timing if piven goes serious one segment you can expect dillon or ferrara will follow him up with some outstanding comedy all of these actors are great comedic and dramatic actors but theyd be nothing without the writing of the show the characters never veer away from being believable and always speak like they should it would be easy for a show like this to depend on gimmicks instead the writers painstakingly find creative ways to homage great filmmaking without losing track of their characters
4702570 thompson didnt have a good game against hawaii and thats still on his mind and it bothers him
4702571 its not to the point where hes thinking about it but he wont forget it he knows mentally that was not the player he wants to be known as hes on a mission to prove to people he can play that position
4702572 the hawaii game was kind of an eye opening game for me
4702573 i got thrown into the fire it was the most i played that definitely motivates me to get in the film room and do whats necessary to be an elite player
4702574 brandyn has a lot of talent you could see that right away but a lot of guys have a lot of potential that doesnt mean a whole lot youve got to do something with it and hes done that this fall
4702575 he has tremendous footwork probably one of the better freshmen coming in that ive had
4702576 we and he are reaping the benefits of him playing
4702577 he wouldnt be where he is right now had he not played last year
4702578 naturally being a smaller corner like i am people are going to think im not physical
4702579 its something ive got to take pride in to me thats a mental thing youve got to want to be physical
4702580 usually they were throwing a piece of black tape over the logo
4702581 which comes to 750 000 of value if youre comparing it to ad buys
4702582 are trying to turn an energy shortage into an asset
4702583 i get rewarded for how hard i work and for how smart i work
4702584 trust me when someone tries to damage me some way sooner or later pays for it when you touch me you make many people unhappy really upset and they live not too far from you
4702585 i just hope you dont give them more arguments to consider taking any actions playing with fire is highly dangerous didnt your parents ever tell you
4702586 when youre in an airplane you dont want your fuel to start solidifying
4702587 so we have a bit of a chicken and egg problem
4702588 were looking for something that is so correct in its performance that it can be interchanged with petroleum based kerosene
4702589 from a distribution standpoint from a technical standpoint it needs to fit without modifications or special handling
4702590 if anyone is below 50 a gallon id be stunned
4702591 we have a pretty good idea on how to grow algae the biggest challenge is in the harvesting and how to extract it from the water
4702592 you arent going to find a fuel thats pennies on the dollar than what we find today
4702593 even if we were to double the volume we were to make in biofuels every year for the next 10 years were still looking at maybe this will impact 15 percent of the overall fuel supply
4702594 realistically for anything to be happening at scale enough to actually impact an airlines bottom line were years away
4702595 every great project needs to transform itself in order to excel and today we are starting that process
4702596 we remain hopeful that well see a tentative agreement this weekend
4702597 any financial or contractual relationships between our company and imperium renewables were ended by july 1 2008
4702598 all of a sudden it seems like the bottom fell out
4702599 the whole idea was lets be so unbelievably diversified that we wont be affected but when the credit markets seize up no matter what kind of financial company you are everything seizes up
4702600 the ubs statement basically shows the model is a failure
4702601 concept behind the creation of jpmorgan chase has broken down
4702602 no steel company can sell steel when auto manufacturers arent selling cars and no bank can make big profits when theres a weakness in the housing and credit markets
4702603 they have to ride out the cycle minimize the losses and maximize profits when the cycle returns you cant restructure a company to avoid that cycle
4702604 this wasnt specifically requested by ak chin but the tribe does support it
4702605 the tribe and its elders have standards and preferences which the proposal recognizes
4702606 the tribe already has private agreements with adjacent utilities that prevent effluent discharges on its reservation this proposal if adopted would in essence codify that arrangement
4702607 there would a significant loss to the riparian areas we have been trying to restore
4702608 we just really want to understand whether we made any impact on them in our discussion i walked away not thinking we will get much relief
4702609 its in the interests of most of the water users that the effluent not go outside the tucson ama and thats true whether the ak chin object or not
4702610 i think you could do a constructed recharge project that would leave the channel relatively intact
4702611 and speaking for tucson water and as a pima county wastewater ratepayer i think there could be opportunities to dramatically reduce those costs
4702612 i certainly hope adeq would allow us to give that a go before some draconian new regulatory regime came down
4702613 in an arm plant youre dealing with how pretty the plant is
4702614 once the policy goes into effect and the officers are trained it will be clear to them what cases they notify immigration and customs enforcement and what ones they dont
4702615 if there is any doubt there are patrol supervisors who will be called out to the scene to work through the situation
4702616 heres the driving force behind this we want to be careful that we dont create an underclass of victims who wont report crimes out of fear because they happen to be in the u s illegally
4702617 were not in the business of enforcing federal immigration laws
4702618 were in the business of investigating crimes and we want victims to feel that when theyre victimized they can report those incidents to the local police and they will be aggressively investigated
4702619 what prompted this was an effort within the tucson police department to be in line with what other municipal law enforcement agencies across the state and across the united states are doing
4702620 this is a progressive policy that most police departments accept we understand that none of these law enforcement agencies including us really have the resources to get involved in enforcing federal immigration law
4702621 the fact that they explicitly prohibit inquiries under those circumstances is a huge step forward in ensuring accountability and making sure people can trust law enforcement
4702622 they dont have a choice to pick and choose which laws theyre going to enforce
4702623 to come up with this policy of witnesses and victims and everything else is moot when you look at the overall scheme of things it negates that argument of only separating out the criminals because theyre already criminals by entering the country illegally
4702624 i dont understand how that helps us become more secure as a country and more secure as a community
4702625 these sanctuary policies that are put forth have wound up to be dismal failures and have cost communities more than they stood to gain
4702626 i wasnt going to talk to any press because things get twisted and contorted but now im hoping to put a stop to some of these lies
4702627 im hoping people can see through the lies to see the real child the child that is in a lot of pain
4702628 the biggest concern i have is the projection that he intended to kill his sister that didnt happen
4702629 ive never met a kinder more soft hearted kid in my life i dont think he has the capacity to kill anyone intentionally i think this was a tragic accident and he is really torn up about it
4702630 he started acting out i think he was wanting more attention from his father
4702631 after it happened he told me that he could never commit suicide because it would hurt too much
4702632 i feared that one day i would wake up and hed be gone
4702633 my gut said dont do it keep him home but i let him go
4702634 if i had known he would have been home in a heartbeat getting the help he needed
4702635 every conversation i had with my son he was in good spirits he missed his family here but that was to be expected
4702636 i am very sorry for rolands loss my heart goes out to him i have been praying that god will heal his broken heart and comfort him in his time of need
4702637 you dont know how its going to turn out all you can control is going out there and playing good baseball
4702638 the same thing happened against korea we were behind against cuba and came back but we had to have this one the guys showed a lot of character coming back
4702639 i wanted to run as easy as possible and come up with the slowest time i could
4702640 when xie xingfang fought back in the third game i thought it might be too hard to win
4702641 after the previous four matches in the competition i have been very exhausted and today i felt tired
4702642 were spending money here to make more money down in the future
4702643 you create your own opportunities and for now this is my opportunity
4702644 in my other company i already had made a lot of changes in staffing and reducing staff its hard to say how many more changes ill have to make
4702645 our markets are down but we are fortunate enough to have the right financing to be able to take care of this and go for it
4702646 we saw a big opportunity and the bar and grill business we think is something that could be very prosperous in that it will be something that the community needs
4702647 we thought that this would be a great opportunity to possibly offset you know our wages and make a little more money
4702648 horse owners need to take precautions and vaccinate their horses
4702649 his grandfather and i spend about two and a half to three hours before a show shining all the chrome
4702650 people ask why take that extra step its for the reaction
4702651 its about respect from your fellow riders its not winning trophies when people come into the show and you see all the spectators its not about the trophies
4702652 when its showtime its showtime everyone knows what time it is
4702653 a lot of it is about pride people put their heart and soul into these bikes and cars
4702654 after he graduates we have a long time until then
4702655 i think it reflects the boards concerns about the fund balance
4702656 instead of a coach they are more of an interventionist that works more directly with kids
4702657 the folks who were coaches were absorbed through available positions in the district
4702658 theres no way to get past it even if you get wet
4702659 it wakes them up and adds fun to the job
4702660 its a flexible job and the people i work with are a lot of fun
4702661 i realize that the problems are huge and daunting but i dont believe theres anything that cant be fixed as long as everyone is pulling in the same direction
4702662 i love challenges i love complex issues and problems and this certainly met all that
4702663 i wanted to know that i would have the ability to call the shots
4702664 basically said youre the publisher and ceo its yours to run and that was pretty much it
4702665 one of the questions i asked sam was are you going to keep this
4702666 no intention of changing the editor of the los angeles times
4702667 hell meet you once and he wont forget your name he wont forget what you do and hell care about all of that
4702668 its a very refreshing way for a senior leader to be
4702669 the market conditions were the driving force behind it not happening
4702670 those guys are very bright guys if they couldnt get it done im not sure who couldve
4702671 i had to take my goggles off first to make sure the one was next to my name
4702672 im in sort of a dream world sometimes you have to pinch yourself to see if it is real
4702673 its the smallest margin of victory in our sport it was pretty cool
4702674 i was starting to hurt for the last 10 meters it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could
4702675 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i had lost the race right there but i guess that was the difference in the end
4702676 the depth and magnitude of the job losses are accelerating clearly
4702677 the only jobs available are at mcdonalds kfc or taco bell but you cant survive on 8 an hour not with these gas prices
4702678 were going to be past the worst problems in the housing sector and hopefully international trade imports will show a little more strength and retail will be stabilized
4702679 double whammy of sharp declines in real estate prices and the high cost of energy
4702680 many people in low incomes are having difficulty making ends meet
4702681 i thought i was secure but now im stuck out here with the rest of the people
4702682 the customers are saying if we pay our money whats going to happen if theres a problem
4702683 there are a lot of unsavory characters involved with these travel agencies
4702684 we are working together with the convention committee on many levels to ensure a successful convention this year
4702685 as we announced earlier moving forward one of sen obamas reform priorities will include changes in the way party conventions are funded to assure they can be run without dependence
4702686 both conventions are bringing in new fundraisers connected with the presidential candidate to go the last mile
4702687 the deployment of new antimissile forces in europe has as its aim the russian federation
4702688 the moment has been chosen well and therefore any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work
4702689 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia when a great power invaded a small neighbor and overthrew its government
4702690 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely that the ossetians and the abkhazians will be able to live in one state together with the georgians
4702691 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4702692 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4702693 poland by deploying the interceptors is exposing itself to a strike 100
4702694 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4702695 when im talking to myself id always rather be talking to you

4702697 well if youre not an eagles fan then who do you support
4702698 mary why are you a broncos fan when you live in americas city of brotherly love philadelphia
4702699 because my mom and dad are from denver and my mom is a broncos fan and my dad is a broncos fan so im a broncos fan too
4702700 thats no reason for you to be a broncos fan you dont have to be just like your parents all of the time what if your mom was a prostitute and your dad was a drug addict and a car thief what would you be then

4702705 a restructuring of public space to include better alternative transportation
4702706 its like i walked into a klan rally in a boy george costume
4702707 the state spent so much money on you provided you with such good facilities gave you four years to train
4702708 our athletes are often more psychologically fragile than foreign athletes
4702709 today we have too many things to show to the world china no longer needs the number of gold medals to prove itself
4702710 in the last few days of competition the greatest harvest for china is not the position on top of the gold list but the growing psychological maturity of the people
4702711 young earth creationists believe from the biblical account that dinosaurs were created on day 6 of the 5 approximately 6 000 years ago along with other land animals and therefore co existed with humans
4702712 i know when i saw this place i knew i had to move here

4702718 thank you queensland for your support and love for the show
4702719 i think this is the best crowd we have had for a number of years and judging by smiles on faces throughout the past 10 days everyone has had a ball
4702720 ich mag den britischen humor schaue liebend gerne die verfilmten romane von rosamunde pilcher und trage gerne englische kleidung
4702721 nur die mehrtonhupe wurde nachger stet die wegfahrsperre verlangt die versicherung und die originalreifen sind mir einfach zu teuer
4702722 aber verkaufen kommt f r mich ohnehin nicht in frage
4702723 nat rlich war es die im vollen tank die pl tzlich den geist aufgab
4702724 man verliert schnell die angst kann eigentlich alles selbst reparieren und ohnehin nichts kaputt machen
4702725 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4702726 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4702727 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4702728 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4702729 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4702730 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4702731 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4702732 how to write a test case for ldap single master replication
4702733 the options now remaining seem to be 1 to live with the new ascendant ideology 2 to enter into the legal complexities of trying to get permission for ones congregation to be dismissed to another denomination or 3 to find a way to be in the denomination but not of the denomination the presbyterian global fellowship seeks to be a parallel society living a new vision for the church within the pc usa in pgf we treat the pc usa for what it is a relic of a christendom that is disappearing before our very eyes while we are not the driving force behind efforts at institutional reform as many have noted nonetheless we will join with others in these efforts and consider them important to the fulfillment of our core mission of transforming mainline presbyterian congregations
4702734 the question is whether in the shadow of the dominant machinery we will be granted the freedom to invest our resources arrange our ministries and order our life together
4702735 i didnt touch you only the tip of my left index finger touched you
4702736 how do we escape the judgment of god and participate in the approval of persons whom god has in judgment abandoned to the consequences of their sin
4702737 indeed if we consider the unblushing promises of reward and the staggering nature of the rewards promised in the gospels it would seem that our lord finds our desires not too strong but too weak we are half hearted creatures fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea we are far too easily pleased
4702738 ecclesiastes 9 4 a live dog is better off than a dead lion
4702739 youll come home with 100 new ideas for your church and a 12 step program for missional transformation
4702740 dear god please give me a red bike on thursday at 4 00 p m
4702741 tonight i will not demand your life knowing you would surrender it to me is all i need to know get up dust yourself off and lets get to work
4702742 so what has really changed with this latest general assembly
4702743 the church that is simply of this world has nothing to bring to this world it does not engage the world it only reflects it
4702744 why even have church any church what good is it
4702745 the church that is simply of this world has nothing to bring to this world
4702746 in pgf we treat the pc usa for what it is a relic of a christendom that is disappearing before our very eyes
4702747 what if were wrong as an evangelical i sometimes wonder how could so many good people on the other side be wrong about these things how can i be so sure that my reading of scripture and spirit is correct and if its not what then should that possibility stop me in my tracks i dont think so but it calls for humility and civility toward those with whom we disagree knowing that in the end god will sort it all out
4702748 it is at this point that todays pc usa failed
4702749 it is nice for large churches that function pretty much as a world unto themselves to decide to ignore the denomination they are in but smaller churches have no such freedom
4702750 those who are called to ordained service in the church by their assent to the constitutional questions for ordination and installation w 4 4003 pledge themselves to live lives obedient to jesus christ the head of the church striving to follow where he leads through the witness of the scriptures and to understand the scriptures through the instruction of the confessions
4702751 why remain a part of something you believe it heretical and a relic
4702752 and your friends posit too easily a global consensus regarding biblical standards for sexual practice
4702753 as to kerri peterson davis wondering how she is supposed to stay in conversation with those who accuse her of heresy rev peterson davis you need not remain in conversation with us the days of dialog are over we are at war your side declared war on us and on the word of god
4702754 where your treasure is there will be your heart also
4702755 pledge themselves to live lives obedient to jesus christ the head of the church striving to follow where he leads through the witness of the scriptures and to understand the scriptures through the instruction of the confessions
4702756 the answer is that the church no longer believes that scripture is normative for matters of faith and practice
4702757 mission is the place where we can join together again and be about christs business
4702758 you are in an enviable position inasmuch as peachtree presbyterian church could by witholding its money bring the presbytery of greater atlanta to its knees and perhaps you all should do that
4702759 ive called our denomination a rotary dial phone wanting to be taken seriously in a digital world
4702760 the good news is that the auto industry is waking up
4702761 tell that to the thousands of uaw caw workers who suddenly have no jobs and no way to support their families
4702762 gm will keep doing what it does best make the great american car
4702763 while some in the church are doing the necessary work of trying to make us better pgf is devoting itself to the longer term work of making us well through the transformation of our local and regional ministries
4702764 modern society and emphasis on the secular while downplaying the message of jesus has slowly but inexorably grown
4702765 i am here to proudly announce that i am an adulterer and have a deep conviction that god made me that way therefore as part of my duties i fully intend to engage fully in the practices of marital infidelity for the building up of the kingdom
4702766 a healthy stream of dialogue for the betterment of the missional call of the church
4702767 i am here to proudly announce that i am an adulterer
4702768 the low point was an anecdote that he no doubt thought was hilariously funny
4702769 astounded by the generosity and compassion and genuine willingness to serve
4702770 come to any conclusions or create a five point strategy
4702771 rather it was to open up our minds to other ways of seeing god ourselves and our neighbor that are more faithful to the intentions and purposes of god
4702772 with so many variant views the term missional church now needs something like an fda label warning contradictory and conflicting views of the church inside
4702773 then again how can they say that the flesh which is nourished with the body of the lord and with his blood goes to corruption and does not partake of life let them therefore either alter their opinion or cease from offering the things just mentioned but our opinion is in accordance with the eucharist and the eucharist in turn establishes our opinion for we offer to him his own announcing consistently the fellowship and union of the flesh and spirit for as the bread which is produced from the earth when it receives the invocation of god is no longer common bread but the eucharist consisting of two realities earthly and heavenly so also our bodies when they receive the eucharist are no longer corruptible having the hope of the resurrection to eternity
4702774 engaging gods world a christian vision of faith learning and living
4702775 heaven is a place on earth why everything you do matters to god
4702776 for the beauty of the earth a christian vision for creation care
4702777 suzy has been flat on her back with a rare spine condition for about 5 years though the recipient of much love and practical care from her church family suzy is an active giver in every encounter she has lost job home car independence mobility much of what we typically prize in our lives but she gives prayer support encouragement wisdom insight counsel to all she comes into contact with she maintains an active written correspondence with the whole congregation of nearly 1000 she is frequently on the phone counseling with women in distress she lives with debilitating pain she shares light and salt generously having turned her back on self absorption she is available to her lord as the horizontal handmaiden
4702778 while i imagined that my first ministry internship would be all about figuring out how to do ministry ive valued this past year because its given me the chance to reflect on how my churchs mission statement to encourage one another to follow jesus christ and to call others to him can look in the lives of twenty and thirty somethings today
4702779 that even the parts of our stories that we are least likely to tell that carry the most shame or guilt or pain for us are the very parts where god has met us and
4702780 so were changing our identity but that doesnt take a preacher it takes a whole community
4702781 there is no formula to what we have done other than catching the next wave and not shying away from it and that takes courage and a willingness to risk and thats the kind of thing that our sermons have been able to lead its a whole pathway to transformation that we have been walking on for years and on that pathway we were able to get preaching and discipleship connected so that they had a greater impact so that people werent just making friends but so that there was a transforming a community strategy so i call it our discipleship strategy but for the purpose of transforming a community not just individuals the individuals get transformed thats for sure but the more profound thing has been that we feel like we are on a journey of discovering a new way to do church and to be christians in our culture in order to make an impact the goal is the impact that god will make in the world not the church being a great church
4702782 faith presbyterian church is a traditional missions minded church that is exploring what it means to make the move to missional faith was founded in 1958 with a strong commitment to missions this commitment has been lived out by giving a significant portion of the budget to evangelism and mission currently just under 20 and by encouraging and supporting members in both long term and short term missions there is a long list of missions and ministries in which our members participate our session has taken the step of calling the whole church to a year of engaging the word in small groups to seek gods face for what it means to be a missional congregation as a staff we are reading the missional leader the session will be logging on to missional web as a basis for monthly discussions of what missional will mean for us a team of members is exploring ways we might make a greater impact for christ in our community outside our walls it is just a start but we are on our way
4702783 a website to create awareness around global poverty and entrepreneurial innovation
4702784 trying to engage the christian community around innovative organizations through two blogs
4702785 minimize the impact to lower income citizens on a fixed income
4702786 a public hearing is set for the purpose of receiving any comments concerning the increased rates for water and wastewater said public hearing is to be held at city hall at 302 union street on monday august 18 2008 at 6 30 pm
4702787 we need vision we need to see our world through the lens of gods eyes our culture shapes us tv seeks to mold our thinking and seeing of the world information and interaction on the internet further forms us is our vision going forward coming from god or all these other sources its a life or death question our vision conference aims to recalibrate us with gods vision for our vision for third vision for the city and the world we need that recalibration we need god given focus i am praying that god will give us new vision as we enter a new year thats a big prayer but were talking about something big a life that matters for god a life that is being transformed by god
4702788 very successful and a wonderful way to come together as a congregation and begin the year
4702789 presbyterians dont act like this this is really out of the box
4702790 the impact of the michael frost video in our little group is phenomenal it would astound you
4702791 i had begun to think that god had given up on me he was holding out on me i had been a christian all my life but by this time had stopped going to church anywhere
4702792 all of my suffering was right there and it showed
4702793 cornerstone yeah i know about that place my girlfriend is in recovery there
4702794 its just the way i live my life the problem is that were all so busy you have to slow your life down or you cant do this i can order a book on amazon because its fast and cheap theres a book store 150 feet from the church but i cant get it as cheap or fast so am i willing to build relationships with the ladies who work there now people at church are saying why wouldnt you do that im all about efficiency but it is the less efficient life that is fuller were starting to see that people are leading the way on this and have their heart set toward other people theyre not viewing it as a program and more about lifestyle its kind of like walking thru the kitchen of your house and finding that theres some stuff on the counter you dont set up a program to deal with it you just make it part of your life
4702795 just show up and shoot pool develop relationships and hang out
4702796 we are in the early stages of exploring and adopting and adapting to missional living we are excited about it because it so resonates in our hearts and with where god has been leading us the past few years
4702797 after attending the pgf conference in houston i returned excited about what i heard and eager to begin the shift to becoming a missional church our officers retreat this year will focus on mission and well be using a dvd of michael frosts keynote address at the conference to help us think about what it might mean for us to become a truly missional church
4702798 were serving over 300 people a day from our little church with all kinds of community outreach
4702799 im not sure what point he was making but that was a great story
4702800 is the church like a cruise ship whose mission and staff are focused on attracting people to its own programs and giving people a good time so that their consumer impulses are satisfied their felt needs are cared for and they believe that their money has been well spent or is the church an aircraft carrier whose mission and staff are focused toward equipping and empowering our people for their ministries every day in the world
4702801 as the father has sent me now i am sendin you
4702802 i came up with a list of streets that needed to be paved and a lot of them arent on the list
4702803 i put down the worst streets we have in town
4702804 i think in the end the council should decide what streets need to be paved
4702805 our streets are falling apart our water lines are falling apart and i dont think we can just sit here any longer
4702806 i know whats wrong with the line but ive had to fight with the city every time it stopped up
4702807 i want to stop that fight with the city wording and get some agreement with the city and residents
4702808 well look and make a determination of what it will take to fix it if its our place to fix it and well let you know what can happen as soon as we can
4702809 for the past five months weve been putting out fires but were going to take care of it
4702810 we have a problem with dogs and cats in marble hill
4702811 we have a nuisance ordinance and i would like to see people obey the law and license their dogs
4702812 the word alcohol bothers me because it sounds like it approves anything
4702813 we help people discover a god who loves us more than we can possibly imagine by stepping into gods mission of restoration and reconciliation we can discover the life that is worth living for and dying for
4702814 on another sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled
4702815 on a sabbath jesus was teaching in one of the
4702816 the lord is good to all and his compassion is over all that he has made the eyes of all look to you and you give them their food in due season you open your hand you satisfy the desire of every living thing
4702817 love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you so that you may be sons of your father who is in heaven for he makes the sun rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on the just
4702818 god cares not only about redeeming souls but also about restoring his creation he calls us to be agents not only of his saving grace but also of his common grace our job is not only to build up the church but also to build a society to the glory of god as agents of gods common grace we are called to help sustain and renew his creation to uphold the created institutions of family and society to pursue science and scholarship to create works of art and beauty and to heal and help those suffering from the results of the fall

4702851 i am touched by the support this is an overwhelming support
4702852 we want change the future is anwar long live anwar
4702853 i am so moved by the villagers who came out so early in the morning to show their support
4702854 i have known the people here and they know what to expect from me if i am elected i am after all a two term assemblyman and i have been doing my work since way back
4702855 i know anwar well we have been friends and i look forward to taking him on

4702857 they are afraid of me being an mp and going on to become the opposition leader in parliament
4702858 you are never satisfied and we are nowehere near we need to be but it was a good hit out
4702859 they are a tough and competitive side who are very strong in the tackle contest and in david pocock you saw a player who is probably one of the best in the world at it but we have learned a lot
4702860 we showed some nice patches of attack at the start and end of the game but the middle bit wasnt too flashy
4702861 you saw that in the closing minutes when they made a line break and you had guys like kris chesney and cencus johnston who were flat out on their feet but they absolutely busted a gut to get back in the line
4702862 we were really sharp in the first part of the game but we dropped off a bit as we struggled to get good ball
4702863 but youd be happy with a try like that in any form of football we showed some of the skills we have in the squad and if we can work a bit harder on getting our formations and order right in that area it will take care of itself thats what the next few warm up games are for but there will also be a big focus on getting our set piece and defence right

4702897 our problem today is that we want to live a victorious and perfect life yet we do not live and act by christ we have the heart to live by christ even to live christ but we are not accustomed to doing this on the contrary we are accustomed to living ourselves we spontaneously live ourselves without intending to do so and without deliberately exercising any part of our being however in order to live christ we need to exercise our entire being
4702898 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4702899 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4702900 they accepted the ruling because it was not the human eye making the judgment
4702901 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4702902 there is no doubt the question was for him to share or not to share first place there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps
4702903 in the old days the judges ruled now its the timers
4702904 technology is also imperfect the hand is quicker than the eye
4702905 they couldnt believe phelps got there and im sure ill feel the same way
4702906 there hasnt really been an error in the timing system that ive ever heard of the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first
4702907 im not about fighting it im not angry at all

4702921 the socialist regime of cronacia was mild and orderly in no way quarrelsome regarding its black hearted 1 11 neighbour of nihilon
4702922 die sozialistische regierung von kronakien war ordnungsliebend und vertr glich und suchte keineswegs streit mit nihilon dem t ckischen nachbarn
4702923 die sozialistische regierung von kronakien war ordnungsliebend und vertr glich und suchte keineswegs streit mit nihilon dem nachbarn von finsterer gesinnung

4702929 consider the qualifications that were required and the kind of person one had to be the person who replaced the offerings and sacrifices had to be one who was absolutely for god even in every small thing anyone who is not absolutely for god in all of the small things is not qualified to do the will of god to replace the old sacrifices and offerings with the new that is to take away the first and establish the second
4702930 wow this is amazing how can anyone see such a thing from these verses

4702940 many of these families drive without licenses and when the state police started stopping people earlier this year and bringing them to court people got scared also the economic situation in the state is grave the cost of food and gasoline and everything is going up many of these people earn just 6 an hour so all of this has created a situation where they cannot maintain their lives here
4702941 i dont think the executive order was signed in order to force people to leave the state although that could very well be a consequence of it
4702942 if so i say thats great congratulations to the governor because we are gaining something here in rhode island if its forcing some people to leave

4702987 we dedicated our efforts towards strengthening dainik jagran and various other initiatives we are pretty positive about future of the media industry in general and business in particular
4702988 at present the baosteel group has no reason or motive toreduce its stake
4702989 meine montessori ausbildung zeigte mir auf wieviel spa es machen kann neues zu entdecken
4702990 ich glaube der beste teil ist es einfach wie unglaublich kreativ man sich f hlt wenn man die verschiedenen bereiche der welt gestaltet
4702991 die kreation einer intelligenten rasse die sich im weltall auf der suche nach dem sinn des lebens machen kann
4702992 ich wollte schon immer ein spiel entwickeln dass sich an zehn hoch anm d red buch und kurzfilm ber die reise von elementarteilchen quarks zu leuchtstarken galaxien quasaren orientiert ich hege au erdem ein gro es interesse f r astrobiologie wissenschaft ber die m glichkeiten extraterrestrischer lebensformen weil die so wahnsinnig viele bereiche der wissenschaft geschichte und zukunft ber hrt
4702993 ich m chte mit spore viele verschiedene spieler erreichen ich w nsche mir dass sich der durchschnittliche sims spieler mit spore besch ftigt um sich kreativ auszutoben und geschichten zu erleben und der hardcore spieler wegen der strategischen tiefe
4702994 mit dem kreatureneditor kannst du ja problemlos kleine fellige tiere oder ork artige zweibeiner erstellen ich glaube aber eigentlich dass spore dadurch interessanter wird dass es aussieht wie kaum ein anderes spiel
4702995 wenn du das m chtest klar du kannst eine ungef hre imitation der menschlichen entwicklung nachspielen
4702996 wir konzentrieren uns sehr auf die emotionalen zust nde der spielfiguren au erdem f hlen sich spieler wie die sims reihe gezeigt hat sehr verbunden mit figuren die sie selbst erschaffen haben
4702997 begriffe wie gut oder b se benutzen wir nicht aber nat rlich kannst du sowohl sehr aggressiv als auch friedfertig vorgehen der gr te thematische unterschied ist nat rlich dass du in spore den ganzen weg mitmachst deine kreaturen starten als mickrige teichwesen und k nnen sich letztendlich sogar zu g tter hnlichen wesen entwickeln und eigene welten kreieren
4702998 mit den ersten konzepten habe ich im jahr 2000 angefangen
4702999 delfine sie haben es geschafft ein verhalten zu entwickeln das ihnen mehr freizeit einr umt als jedem anderen tier auf der welt
4703000 some of these guys had older brothers who played here and won state championships
4703001 so they know what it takes because they know people who have been there so its just not a lofty goal its an expectation they know its their time to step in and carry on the tradition
4703002 there are a lot of really good teams out there if a school could put a few great years together you could see that kind of thing happening
4703003 we played very very poorly and bonneville played very well and they stuck it to us pretty good
4703004 were just not as big and physical as we used to be
4703005 through the years weve been more of a rushing team but weve converted the last two years to throwing it more and i expect to continue the trend
4703006 they almost look at last years success with disdain its not something they take ownership of
4703007 they dont want to be known as the class after the 2007 champs its not the legacy they want to leave i think eventually theyll feel proud but right now they want nothing to do with last season
4703008 to build a successful football program there needs to be a comprehensive approach to the sport
4703009 there needs to be a consistent philosophy you have to be consistent or theyll see right through you
4703010 some are looking at a three peat and to me the goal this year is to get through each practice our players expecct success but its something they have to work for
4703011 if you look at those really good programs youll notice all the coaches they know how to do things together
4703012 dans un premier temps jai fait savoir que ma d claration tait identique la d claration pr c dente comme une mise jour m tait r clam e jai envoy ma d claration de mandats par courriel une d claration par courrier ma t demand e elle a t adress e dans les d lais mais est arriv e avec trois jours de retard la cour des comptes
4703013 im elated ultimately we knew the judge was going to come to this conclusion when youre a police officer and your job is to fight crime when youre sitting the defendants seat thats a difficult seat to be in
4703014 the only time these students acted like kids was when they were around adults
4703015 i feel the kids need that the terminology and the technique will remain pretty much consistent with what theyve done in the past
4703016 in addition to chepuis zane mendenhall will start at a linebacker spot and brandon smith has the ability to be one of the better cornerbacks in the state
4703017 we have to take care of the ball on offense and be tough defensively
4703018 on the surface it looks like were going to air it out
4703019 but we want to control the game and we have kids with capabilities to strike
4703020 is that normal no but in these past two years ua discovered they needed to do more work than they had originally anticipated
4703021 what ua is finding out is that with these facilities they are so old you cant just patch a wall after working on the plumbing but you end up having to replace the entire wall
4703022 i hired them because of their experience and because i know they will be great leaders for our officers
4703023 especially for me because ive worked with him in the past and i know richard has a wealth of knowledge
4703024 i loved it and ill definitely do it next year if the good lord keeps me here
4703025 i talked all of them into doing this one by one
4703026 theyre all still very active and productive theyre not couch potatoes
4703027 the camaraderie between them is amazing theyre all military veterans they know how to work together
4703028 as the economy improves and business improves along with it we will staff accordingly
4703029 i believe that what we create here with the newspaper and web site will continue to be relevant and reliable sources of information
4703030 nearly two thirds of all adults in pima county read one of the two newspapers and or look at the web sites every week
4703031 while these steps we are taking are painful i hope we can all emerge from this economic downturn stronger

4703038 what do you want and how badly do you want it
4703039 i have two grandchildren and a lot of friends who have been having babies and ive been invited to several baby showers and wanted to give them baby gifts
4703040 i was going from store to store to find quality items and was going from place to place to find personalized gifts i wasnt able to find anything i was happy with so i decided to start my own business
4703041 i wanted quality products i wanted them to be unique and i wanted them to be able to be personalized
4703042 i did a lot of searching before i decided on which products i wanted
4703043 i was a mother a teacher and now im a grandmother
4703044 i have lots of experience and research to send along to parents grandparents relatives and friends
4703045 i want to get more items on my website and im going to keep developing my blog im going to be adding childrens cds and more educational baby gift items i also want to add more clothes particularly organic clothes
4703046 i feel that my business demonstrates my love for god and jesus by offering reasonable prices for bibles
4703047 providing bibles is a way to let people know my true character if i have a customer who needs something that i do not have listed i will try my best to locate it for him or her
4703048 i want to add more products to my site such as more audio study and reference material and religious jewels
4703049 i will use the blog to create a desire for folks to want to have a bible i will cover several topics such as scripture and archaeological evidence of gods plan for salvation
4703050 i had been thinking about starting my own business for quite some time
4703051 it was just logical to do an online business as a person who has been shopping online for quite a few years i find it convenient and far more efficient than driving to different locations
4703052 i had been thinking about starting my own business for quite some time
4703053 it was just logical to do an online business as a person who has been shopping online for quite a few years i find it convenient and far more efficient than driving to different locations
4703054 it was a beautiful locket that people have been commenting on
4703055 i wear it everyday and they wanted to know where i got it i decided that those gifts would be my focus to be able to provide the same opportunity for others to obtain treasures is something i hold dear to my heart
4703056 we will be discussing the proper care of jewelry on the blog
4703057 as well as the history of charms and other items of interest we will also be doing research on such things as birthstones and myths
4703058 i believe that if you can do something to make someones day a little brighter its what you must do
4703059 every little bit helps and i try to encourage others to do the same
4703060 all issues can be resolved only through dialogue and peaceful means

4703065 i am touched by the support this is an overwhelming support
4703066 we want change the future is anwar long live anwar
4703067 i am so moved by the villagers who came out so early in the morning to show their support
4703068 i have known the people here and they know what to expect from me if i am elected i am after all a two term assemblyman and i have been doing my work since way back
4703069 i know anwar well we have been friends and i look forward to taking him on
4703070 permatang pauh is in the eyes of the world now it is their voters destiny to put anwar on track to become the next prime minister
4703071 they are afraid of me being an mp and going on to become the opposition leader in parliament
4703072 quien est atropellando todos estos valores y se pone al margen del estado de derecho es el r gimen y sus seguidores la asamblea nacional que ha dado una ley habilitante inconstitucional desde su inicio porque no fue el objeto correspondiente de las leyes sino un cheque en blanco para que el presidente hiciera lo que le diera la gana la asamblea de manera inconstitucional le cedi al ejecutivo todas las atribuciones legislativas en todos los mbitos
4703073 pero la asamblea en vez de cumplir con su funci n controladora pol tica del ejecutivo lo que hace es acallar las voces que defienden la constituci n como ha hecho el m 2d
4703074 ah se nota un fraude total y absoluto y una falta de respeto al pa s habr a que decir como el libertador en la obscuridad s lo trabaja el crimen
4703075 o es que acaso no se sabe que el tribunal supremo de justicia y la asamblea nacional responden a los lineamientos del presidente de la rep blica
4703076 si bien es una cifra importante que representa aproximadamente un tercio de los ingresos extraordinarios petroleros recibidos por el fisco en el primer semestre de este a o es una cifra m s que manejable por el ejecutivo
4703077 por qu destinar mil 200 millones de d lares a comprar un banco eficiente venezuela por qu no destinarlo a otras prioridades en materia de salud infraestructura seguridad
4703078 un estado que se hace m s grande es a la larga garant a de que el ajuste macroecon mico que venga en el futuro tendr mayor resonancia en toda la sociedad
4703079 ya el problema no es si los precios petroleros suben o bajan el problema real es que cada vez necesitamos precios petroleros m s altos para financiar esta nueva concepci n de estado cada vez con m s poder pero con menos capacidad para resolver los problemas m s apremiantes que nos afectan
4703080 un mayor peso de las nuevas formas de organizaci n econ mico social consejos comunales empresas de producci n social empresas mixtas
4703081 en la mayor a de los casos no tienen la experticia t cnica ni el m sculo financiero para acometer proyectos de gran envergadura lo que ha provocado muchos retrasos e inconvenientes
4703082 numerosos agentes perciban que el gobierno tiene problemas fiscales a la luz de los atrasos y la suspensi n de obras el problema es m s grave que la falta de dinero pues tiene que ver con una posici n ideol gica
4703083 el ejecutivo ha se alado que a partir de este a o el gasto debe regirse sobre la base de los lineamientos del plan de desarrollo econ mico y social 2007 2013 en dicho programa se se ala que en los pr ximos seis a os se ha de establecer un modelo productivo socialista formado b sicamente por las empresas de producci n social
4703084 en este contexto cada una de las empresas del sector privado tiene la percepci n en mayor o menor grado de que puede ser v ctima del gobierno
4703085 provoca que las empresas no est n realizando inversiones significativas para incrementar la capacidad de producci n sino que est n invirtiendo en la capacidad para ampliar su cobertura directa e indirecta y profundizar su conocimiento sobre el consumidor
4703086 una situaci n econ mica m s d bil ha conducido a una mayor desaceleraci n en el crecimiento de la demanda de crudo
4703087 debido a una mayor desaceleraci n en el transporte y el consumo de fuel industrial no s lo en am rica del norte sino tambi n en los pa ses de europa y el pac fico el crecimiento de la demanda de crudo declinar en 2009 y ser el menor desde 2002
4703088 issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4703089 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4703090 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4703091 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4703092 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4703093 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4703094 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4703095 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4703096 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4703097 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4703098 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4703099 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4703100 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4703101 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4703102 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4703103 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4703104 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4703105 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4703106 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4703107 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4703108 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4703109 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4703110 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4703111 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4703112 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4703113 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4703114 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4703115 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4703116 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4703121 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorizes its experiences
4703122 this research will move our understanding forward of how brains work and could have a profound effect on many areas of science and medicine
4703123 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4703124 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4703125 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche

4703130 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4703131 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance

4703135 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4703136 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4703137 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4703138 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4703139 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4703140 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4703141 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4703142 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4703143 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4703144 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4703145 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4703146 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4703147 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4703148 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4703149 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4703150 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4703151 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores

4703156 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
4703157 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
4703158 the explosion in expansion of banking services has been phenomenal in the last four years and we have achieved this tremendous growth in the banking space without affecting the quality of our banking service i think that makes all our banks strong today they are stronger today than they were four years ago undoubtedly our banks are good the question is are they the best banks what distinguishes a good bank and a best bank we have many good banks but they can become best banks only if they take banking services to the far corners of this country given their passion and their commitment i have no doubt in my mind that we can make financial inclusion a reality in five years if not less believe me four years ago no one used the phrase financial inclusion today there is no banker worth his salt who can carry on his business without talking about financial inclusion so i take pardonable pride in the fact that we have pushed financial inclusion and i am confident that we can make financial inclusion a reality in five years
4703159 a view from the outside why good economics works for everyone
4703160 he clearly believes that increased investments particularly in sectors such as power which will accelerate growth of our economy and thus help eliminate poverty just as a rising tide lifts all boats to achieve this high growth rate in one of his articles he gives an interesting formula g 2e 4i where g is growth rate four is are infrastructure investment international trade and information technology and two es are education and electricity
4703161 you see how harmonious it is in the olympic village you see all stadiums in beijing are full of joy and enthusiasm when you see the emotion shown by athletes when they win i believe you will feel the world has hope
4703162 beautiful and good things in the world far exceed evil and dark things
4703163 these incidents demonstrate that the world is not as peaceful as we would like it to be
4703164 we are keeping all our promises we have given to the outside world
4703165 you talked about the internet all countries have some regulations about the internet and the question is solved to the satisfaction of the ioc and the press

4703170 i thought maybe it was third but i had no idea i didnt want to celebrate just then because i thought maybe i was fourth
4703171 there was a point in the middle of the race where i thought this could go really well or really bad it started to hurt
4703172 and i just found my happy place and thought of my favorite run at home what am i holding it back for
4703173 the emotions we went through we were just going to tough this thing out and she did
4703174 she was very positive in the warmup area she didnt even want to wear an ice vest it was very good karma
4703175 it got her mind off the race and onto getting healthy again
4703176 good for her eating the poisonous food i guess it all works out in the end i wouldnt have changed anything
4703177 it all started for my era with deena kastor winning a medal in athens in the marathon i think that made us really dream big
4703178 shawn has such an excellent floor routine i think shell let it out in the finals
4703179 and i expect him to perform the same way i mean we wouldnt be friends you know me i dont get along with people who dont go after it it just doesnt work well
4703180 we dont have a weakness but if a team comes out and plays better than us or if we dont come out and play like we know how to play then we can lose
4703181 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
4703182 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
4703183 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
4703184 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
4703185 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
4703186 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
4703187 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
4703188 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
4703189 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
4703190 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
4703191 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
4703192 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
4703193 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
4703194 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
4703195 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
4703196 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
4703197 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
4703198 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
4703199 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
4703200 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
4703201 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
4703202 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
4703203 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
4703204 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
4703205 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
4703206 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
4703207 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
4703208 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
4703209 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
4703210 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
4703211 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
4703212 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
4703213 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
4703214 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
4703215 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
4703216 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
4703217 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
4703218 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
4703219 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
4703220 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
4703221 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
4703222 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
4703223 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
4703224 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
4703225 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
4703226 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
4703227 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
4703228 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
4703229 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
4703230 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
4703231 try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value

4703233 many women dont set their sights high enough and need to be convinced they can do something before doing it they are more risk averse
4703234 one piece of research compared 85 women and 255 men at the director or vice president level and found that the only competency on which the women consistently scored lower than men is self esteem
4703235 this is not to say that men dont also suffer from a lack of confidence at times but it is certainly less widespread
4703236 there is no quicker way to lose touch with an organisation than to close your door to write memos and send email
4703237 sometimes we solve problems faster face to face when we dont have to deal with repetitive memos and email
4703238 most projects involved software development which is notorious for coming in late and over budget to solve this problem we developed a standardised deal sheet that had to be completed and approved by the appropriate organisations including finance in advance of contract approval
4703239 this change allowed us to conduct accurate post project audits to ensure the approved roi was actually achieved
4703240 lately some international hotel groups have been trying to regain control over online markets one marketing strategy used by these hotel groups is the introduction of lowest rate guaranteed programmes

4703242 scientists have been working on the possibilities for decades nanotechnology today is an emerging set of tools techniques and unique applications involving the structure and composition of materials on a nanoscale that is billionths of a metre
4703243 experiments with bulk materials normally yield empirical data that support the principles of physics and electrical engineering nanomaterials do not always do this
4703244 the same amount of information that fits on a current 80 gigabyte hard drive will be able to fit in a space that is too small to see with the naked eye
4703245 keep the line taut and you can bring it safely to the net
4703246 address them directly start talking about them and their concerns needs and wants and you have their undivided attention
4703247 talk to them try to gauge their reaction to each new sentence have you just said something interesting or are they staring out of the window or looking at a newspaper
4703248 perhaps we feel we are on a roll and dont want to interrupt the creative flow maybe we just cant stop
4703249 for example big projects call for big proposals yet all too often their authors are forced to resort to padding
4703250 if you have the talent to be a good writer you must pair it with a ruthless desire to cut your copy to the bone
4703251 the one thing we dont want our reader to know is what good writers we are although paradoxically you have to be a very good writer in the first place to avoid this trap
4703252 we want them looking at the view not the window
4703253 some of the worst culprits are management consultancies accountancy firms and government departments
4703254 there is no substitute for derivative if you are in the arbitrage business but if you habitually refer to a spade as a soil excavation facilitator you have some work to do
4703255 you are not well represented by a letter that has a typo or is not grammatically correct unless they are desperate recruiters never recommend candidates whose letters and resumes contain such errors
4703256 a good rule of thumb is to keep all sentences to 23 or fewer words
4703257 the important information is information that communicates your value your ability to contribute in a meaningful way in less than 15 seconds
4703258 you only get a veggie sub if you pay for it

4703262 die wie wir alle l ngst jegliches gesp r f r die gefahr verloren hatten und sich immer dichter um den bmw dr ngten um einen blick zu erhaschen auf die armen geiseln auf der r ckbank besonders auf silke bischoff der degowski die ganze zeit den lauf seiner pistole unter das kinn hielt

4703264 ich stand wie unter trance aber ich sp rte keine angst die todesgefahr in der ich mich befand ich nahm sie einfach nicht wahr
4703265 wie das ist selbst durch die medienmangel gedreht zu werden
4703266 ich habe es damals gemacht in meiner zeitung am n chsten tag

4703277 the costly myths that entrepreneurs investors and policy makers live by
4703278 you know what im going to earn less money running my own business but i really dont like to work for other people and thats why im doing it its making me happier and i really dont care
4703279 but itll take me a lot of time to write it and i could just be starting
4703280 the us economy is not at a very good stage whereas brazil is very hot now endeavor helped me see this
4703281 they complained that we were only trying to build a middle class not to help the poor despite all the academic evidence that a strong middle class is essential to prosperity
4703282 it is a lot of fun you go to all these nice places in the world find all these young enthusiastic people who you get to help sometimes you invest maybe make some money
4703283 endeavors genius has been to get the establishment in these countries together not to kill these entrepreneurial companies but to support them
4703284 was at a very interesting discount and pay it when you can
4703285 when i said i was going to start a business it was against everyones advice from my family to my university
4703286 now go to the same university and the same professors will tell you that one of their goals is to produce good entrepreneurs
4703287 discovered the new thing that it pays to have an idea not rely on land or investing
4703288 if endeavor had been an investor rather than an independent objective non profit enabler it would not have been trusted by the business elite or the entrepreneurs
4703289 una idea u oportunidad detectada por alguna persona un emprendedor dispuesto a mitigar el riesgo de dicha oportunidad uno o varios negocios o consumidores dispuestos a evaluar adoptar y asimilar el nuevo producto y finalmente competidores que aseguran la imitaci n del resto del mercado

4703294 de 72 ramas de actividad que contempla la econom a mexicana son contadas con los dedos las que tienen competencia efectiva y acceso al mercado
4703295 si una econom a quiere crecer r pidamente tiene que buscar el capitalismo emprendedor
4703296 esta diferencia se debe a la situaci n econ mica de las ltimas d cadas
4703297 por la alta incidencia de mujeres jefas de hogar y porque les permite combinar sus ocupaciones en el hogar y ofrecer algo al mercado

4703303 somos el nico pa s de la ocde que tiene dos secretar as peleadas con pol ticas totalmente diferentes la de educaci n y la del trabajo que no existe en el resto de las econom as ocde
4703304 m xico ya tiene los elementos para la estabilidad econ mica ya hiciste la tarea de balancearte ahora tienes que cambiar esas condiciones hacia la productividad
4703305 los emprendedores son la respuesta ellos pueden ayudar con eso pues hacen el mercado mucho m s competitivo est el caso de amazon que transform la industria editorial
4703306 m xico tiene el tlcan lo que obliga a muchas compa as a competir con firmas de estados unidos por ejemplo cemex tiene que competir en el escenario mundial y eso la hace competitiva
4703307 mayores oportunidades para ser proveedores de estas empresas transnacionales y al mismo tiempo la necesidad de desarrollar una base de recursos humanos m s preparados
4703308 hombres como azc rraga zambrano toni slim marcos achar carlos fern ndez o pedro aspe saben que para hacer crecer a este pa s no basta s lo con ellos sino que tienen que construir una gran clase media y que los emprendedores tienen el potencial para beneficiar a la econom a

4703315 barangsiapa bersumpah dengan menyebut salah satu asma allah kemudian melanggar sumpahnya maka ia wajib membayar
4703316 sesungguhnya allah melarang kamu untuk bersumpah dengan menyebut nenek moyang kamu siapa yang hendak bersumpah maka bersumpahlah dengan menyebut asma allah atau lebih baik diam saja shahih al bukhary kitab al aiman wa an nadzair ii 530
4703317 apabila ada orang yang dapat mengeluarkan unek unek yang berkaitan dengan masalah tauhid yang ada didalam hati saya maka orang itu adalah imam syafii
4703318 ini adalah tempat dimana allah menenggelamkan firaun apakah kamu tahu bahwa nabi shallallahu alaihi wa salam pernah menyuruh bertanya masalah yang ada dalam hatimu itu
4703319 apakah kamu tahu jenis bintang bintang itu kapan terbitnya kapan terbenamnya dari bahan apa bintang bintang itu diciptakan
4703320 itu masalah makhluk yang kamu lihat dengan mata kepalamu ternyata kamu tidak tahu mana mungkni kamu mau membicarakan tentang ilmu pencipta makhluk itu
4703321 masalah yang kamu perlukan tiap hari lima kali saja tidak kamu pelajari tetapi kamu justru berupaya untuk mengetahui ilmu allah ketika hal itu berbisik dalam hatimu kembali saja kepada firman allah
4703322 dan tuhanmu adalah tuhan yang satu tidak ada tuhan yang haq selain dia yang maha pemurah lagi maha penyayang sesungguhnya didalam penciptaan langit dan bumi pergantian malam dan siang bahtera yang berjalan dilautan dengan membawa barang barang bermanfaat bagi manusia dan air hujan yang diturunkan allah dari langit dimana kemudian dengan air itu allah hidupkan bumi setelah ia mati gersang dan allah menyebarkan diatas bumi semua binatang melata dan pengisaran angin dan awan yang direndahkan antara langit dan bumi semuanya itu merupakan tanda tanda kekuasaan allah bagi orang orang yang berakal
4703323 jadikanlah makhluk itu sebagai bukti atas kekuasaan allah dan janganlah kamu memaksa maksa diri untuk mengetahui hal hal yang tidak dapat dicapai oleh akalmu
4703324 apabila kamu mendengar ada orang berkata bahwa nama itu berlainan dengan apa yang diberi nama atau sesuatu itu berbeda dengan sesuatu itu maka saksikanlah bahwa orang itu adalah kafir zindiq
4703325 segala puji bagi allah yang memiliki sifat sifat sebagaimana dia mensifati diri nya dan diatas yang disifati makhluknya
4703326 kita menetapkan sifat sifat allah ini sebagaimana disebutkan didalam al quran dan sunnah nabi shallallahu alaihi wa salam dan kita meniadakan
4703327 sekali kali tidak sesungguhnya mereka pada hari itu hari kiamat benar benar terhalang dari melihat tuhan mereka
4703328 ayat ini memberitahukan kita bahwa pada hari kiamat nanti ada orang orang yang tidak terhalang mereka dapat melihat allah dengan jelas
4703329 saya datang kerumah imam syafii ketika itu datang sebuah pertanyaan kepada beliau
4703330 sekali kali tidak sesungguhnya mereka pada hari itu terhalang dari melihat tuhannya
4703331 apabila orang orang itu tidak dapat melihat allah karena dimurkai allah maka ini merupakan dalil bahwa orang orang yang diridhai allah akan dapat melihat nya
4703332 ya saya berpendapat seperti itu dan itu saya yakini kepada allah
4703333 saya tidak sependapat seperti pendapatnya saya mengatakan allah berfirman kepada nabi musa secara langsung tanpa penghalang sedangkan dia mengatakan bahwa ketika allah berfirman kepada nabi musa allah menciptakan ucapan ucapan yan kemudian dapat didengar oleh nabi musa secara tidak langsung ada penghalang
4703334 barangsiapa yang mengatakan bahwa al quran itu makhluk maka dia telah menjadi kafir
4703335 dan jika diantara orang orang musryik itu meminta perlindungan kepada kamu maka lindungilah ia supaya ia sempat mendengar kalam allah
4703336 maukah kamu mengakui bahwa allah itu ada dan demikian pula kalamnya atau allah itu ada sedangkan kalamnya belum ada
4703337 wahai orang orang kuffah kamu akan membawakan sesuatu yang agung kepadaku apabila kamu mengakui bahwa allah itu ada semenjak zaman azali begitu pula kalamnya lalu darimana kamu pernah punya pendapat bahwa kalam itu allah atau bukan allah
4703338 imam syafii pernah ditanya tentang sifat sifat allah dan hal hal yang perlu diimani jawab beliau
4703339 dan tetap kekal wajah tuhanmu yang mempunyai kebesaran dan kemuliaan
4703340 shahih bukhari kitab al jihad vi 39 shahih muslim kitab al imarat iii 1504
4703341 dajjal itu pecak sebelah matanya sedangkan allah tidak pecak sebelah mata nya
4703342 tidak ada satu buah hati kecuali ia berada diantara jari jari allah ar rahman
4703343 tidak ada sesuatupun yang serupa dengan allah dan dia maha mendengar lagi maha melihat

4703412 en ning n momento planteamos pagar cualquier cosa por aerol neas argentina ni escapar de todos los organismos de control incluido el congreso
4703413 jaime ya dijo que considera que no se debe pagar nada por la empresa
4703414 no vamos a negociar de rodillas vamos a negociar de pie
4703415 no queremos escaparle a ninguno de los mecanismos de control contemplados para este tema queremos negociar de pie con los espa oles y no de rodillas para llegar a los valores que correspondan y ponerlo a consideraci n del congreso

4703432 to justify these breaches of the permanent indian frontier the policy makers in washington invented manifest destiny a term which lifted land hunger to a lofty plane the europeans and their descendants were ordained by destiny to rule all of america they were the dominant race and therefore responsible for the indians along with their lands their forests and their mineral wealth only the new englanders who had destroyed or driven out all their indians spoke against manifest destiny
4703433 we are not in any imminent danger of filing for bankruptcy
4703434 going forward the markets will remain sensitive to changes in macroeconomic data
4703435 but with many large cap blue chip stocks now trading at attractive valuations and the possibility of targeted pro growth policies from the government in the second half of the year investors may start to see value re emerging
4703436 regardless of the settlements the reality is the investment banks owe equal fiduciary obligations to both retail and institutional investors
4703437 tell me who do you love most in this world
4703438 you are my rib in the bible it was said that god saw that adam was lonely during his sleep god took one of adams rib and created eve every man has been searching for his missing rib only when you find the woman of your life will you no longer feel the lingering ache in your heart
4703439 maybe it was a mistake for us to be together you were never my missing rib
4703440 if im really not your missing rib then please let me go
4703441 it is less painful this way let us go on our separate ways and search for our own partners
4703442 im fine how about you have you found your missing rib
4703443 ill be flying to new york on the next flight
4703444 give me a call when you get back you know my number nothing has changed
4703445 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4703446 changes in merchandising marketing and improved service in the stores have vastly improved the shopping experience and that will continue to drive sales after the economy rebounds
4703447 lamentablemente lucha luciana aymar no est disfrutando como en otros a os seguramente porque en otros a os se la cuidaba m s ahora la cortan todo el tiempo le hacen infracciones
4703448 es muy dif cil esta situaci n para lucha porque cada vez que tiene la pelota vienen dos o tres rivales y le cometen una falta porque saben que de lo contrario les gana
4703449 me contaron que el se or romano hab a dicho que le sal a m s barato que me mandaran a matar porque estaba perdiendo todos los negocios hist ricos que ten a principalmente con operaciones de gerenciadores que manejaban pr cticamente el pami
4703450 intent perpetrar una estafa al pami por tres millones de pesos en una cuesti n de un medicamento muy caro contra la hemofilia factor 7 maniobra en la que estaban involucrados empleados infieles del laboratorio que lo distribuye y de la fundaci n contra la hemofilia
4703451 toda esta mafia desapareci del pami a partir del 2005 y se refugi en otros lugares y puede haber sido ese el m vil de esos terribles asesinatos
4703452 me empez a contar una serie de il citos que involucraban a la industria farmac utica entre ellos y algunos organismos del estado cl nicas privadas y laboratorios medicinales muy importantes
4703453 me refiri que ten a cierto temor por lo que sab a
4703454 trabajar n coordinadamente no se superpondr n ni obstaculizar n una con otra
4703455 en enero se descubri que una persona hab a donado sangre en un lapso de cinco meses y que en el primer an lisis dio negativo pero los resultados dieron positivo en la segunda donaci n
4703456 no se trat de un error m dico ni de procedimiento tiene que quedar bien claro que la sangre que se suministr a los pacientes fue testeada con los dos m todos que exigen las normas nacionales y provinciales
4703457 el problema es que hasta el momento no existe una forma de anular el per odo ventana
4703458 en el pa s la mayor a de los donantes son espor dicos y de reposici n
4703459 los pacientes estaban graves en terapia intensiva uno ten a un shock s ptico mientras el otro sufr a una hemorragia digestiva alta con s ndrome de anemia aguda y ambos necesitaban una transfusi n
4703460 yo siempre digo que si hay justicia voy a ser absuelto
4703461 si hay justicia voy a ser absuelto pero la justicia comienza a ser una palabra abstracta si entendemos que la justicia est encarnada en hombres
4703462 no por los ni os que iban a la fundaci n sino por gente grande que los ha extorsionado
4703463 algunas personas de canal 13 se equivocaron mucho en la investigaci n
4703464 ellos se fueron de periodistas a fiscales a investigadores que tuvieron la osad a de decirles a algunas personas dec esto porque esto es verdad
4703465 digamos que fue realmente lamentable todo lo que da aron a las mismas personas a las que hicieron decir mentiras como as tambi n a las personas que quedaron involucradas en toda esta trama
4703466 no soy el mejor pero estoy del lado de los buenos de los que buscan el amor al pr jimo y todo esto que han inventado tiene otra finalidad
4703467 no tiene m s salida que hacerse la v ctima aunque siempre puede tener preparada alguna maniobra dilatoria de las que ya ha realizado sin las cuales este juicio podr a haberse hecho mucho antes
4703468 los chicos de la fundaci n me extra an y yo extra o a los que no puedo ver
4703469 un claro gesto para los sectores que est n preocupados por el aluvi n de productos chinos
4703470 ahora falta que suba el tipo de cambio o por lo menos que vuelva adonde estaba antes y ya estamos
4703471 esto es para todos los que se quejan y putean por la invasi n de productos chinos
4703472 muchas veces pasa que para cuando se comprueba el dumping ya est todo perdido desaparece la competencia cierran las pymes y el importador que se queda con el mercado aumenta los precios
4703473 es una medida m s bien coyuntural para bajar los nimos permite ganar tiempo para articular con otro tipo de pol ticas e iniciativas de fondo que deber an apuntar a conseguir mejoras de productividad estimular la innovaci n y conseguir que el pa s deje de competir v a precios
4703474 aquellas l neas de producci n que est n bajo un r gimen de comercio internacional administrado que poseen licencias no autom ticas y valores criterio est n manej ndose muy bien

4703481 la reuni n ha sido muy positiva y hemos avanzado en normalizar la situaci n institucional que en alg n momento parec a alejada esa relaci n para nosotros nunca fue alejada en cuanto a la gesti n porque aquellas cosas que est n en marcha en c rdoba son preocupaci n no s lo de los cordobeses sino tambi n del gobierno central
4703482 manifest la voluntad de la presidenta cristina fern ndez de kirchner de que la relaci n institucional sea positiva y yo creo en esa voluntad porque los resultados que hemos obtenido por ser la primera reuni n son altamente positivos
4703483 cumple los requisitos que pide la anses y se acerca a los par metros nacionales se puede consensuar un plan de acompa amiento para los pr ximos cuatro a os
4703484 el 9 de septiembre pr ximo la presidenta va a firmar la adjudicaci n del ltimo tramo entre leones y tortuguitas de la autopista rosario c rdoba que estar finalizado antes del bicentenario

4703486 hay muchas decisiones de inversi n paralizadas y los actuales niveles de inflaci n act an como el principal factor de enfriamiento de la econom a pero a pesar del clima de incertidumbre que seguramente nos acompa ar alg n tiempo m s dif cilmente se termine el a o con un crecimiento por debajo del 7 por ciento nuestra proyecci n de crecimiento anual para el 2008 se ubica hoy en 7 9 por ciento por encima de las estimaciones del consenso del mercado promedio de otras consultoras del 7 3 por ciento
4703487 me enoj la actitud del gobierno de kirchner ayer por el jueves dije cosas que no tendr a que haber dicho porque no ayudan pero dirigirse as al campo es dirigirse as en contra de la rep blica argentina
4703488 rodee bien que se asesore que no siga diciendo que todo est espl ndido
4703489 participar del sistema democr tico porque es mejor pelear de adentro que en las rutas
4703490 pero menem nunca me pregunt qu significaba a l le gust el eslogan
4703491 inter s personal en esto mi inter s es uno solo y es que argentina est condenada al xito yo quiero ver ese xito con mis propios ojos
4703492 el gran error de kirchner fue pensar que con el crecimiento alcanzaba as como menem pens que la convertibilidad era para siempre
4703493 el problema de la pobreza no se soluciona con el bla bla bla ni con invocaciones al combate de la pobreza
4703494 l criticaba a franco macri y yo dije que no hab a que criticarlo a macri sino a la falta que le hacen al pa s 400 empresarios como macri
4703495 hay una gran presencia legislativa de representantes de la industria y el campo y es mejor pelear de adentro que en las rutas
4703496 que nadie se ponga nervioso que no hay ninguna elecci n a la vista y ac no se est lanzando ninguna l nea interna

4703500 the market is fighting to make this recovery stick nasdaq tested its daily upper bb last week and its 10 day ma has gone above the 30 day ma the 20 day ma has turned up spx on the other hand is seeing the 10 day ma above the 20 day ma but was held under the 30 day ma what the market needs now is a solid jump a big green day to catch the daily upper bb to allow the market to continue higher for the new week we have the fed meeting on tuesday i think the fed will likely leave the rates unchanged the financial markets are a bit too nervous right now for the fed to make any changes if the fed leaves the rates unchanged i think the market will likely rally vix closed above 22 last week and right at its 10 day ma this makes monday uncertain id feel more comfortable if vix goes under 22 so ill be watching vix carefully on monday the market is taking cues from the financial sector right now so xlf will also be a good indicator
4703501 if it falls back below 21 the market should be able to recover some of the losses today

4703509 la responsabilidad de carlos sa l menem puede apreciarse con fuerza dados los suficientes elementos convictivos receptados en la instrucci n
4703510 nunca antes se hab a podido avanzar con los cargos pol ticos la investigaci n estuvo limitada a la f brica

4703514 lo mismo que pas ahora dice pino a p ginai12 pero en ese momento me tuvieron una hora o m s dando vueltas me tiraron contra el piso y la cosa fue a cara descubierta
4703515 estamos en el inicio del inicio y todas las hip tesis son probables
4703516 son compatibles con las quemaduras de cigarrillo de su denuncia tambi n la bolsa de la cabeza por eso el hecho no est en duda dijo la fuente lo que estamos buscando es la secuencia
4703517 ive never seen anything like this in my career for software

4703519 clearly room for bristol to claim one thing and imclone the other
4703520 ako ja idem tri sata a za vas bogami neznam
4703521 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
4703522 i may not get there with you the true martin luther king jr
4703523 tried to break my arm they grabbed my collar and tried to choke me and when they got me to the cell they kicked me in
4703524 dont touch him dont touch him we have to pray for him
4703525 i remember the picture being taken and there was nothing rude about it
4703526 because they five kids said it was rude the teachers believed them even though they hadnt seen it
4703527 they have punished him for a crime when they havent even seen the evidence
4703528 why not just pop open the old records and rebuild everything
4703529 to see is not to know to hear is not to experience to do is no to learn to have a will is to do all three at once
4703530 the wizzard media player allows for unprecedented producer control and customization it incorporates all of the best features i have seen in other web video players and several that are innovative and unique
4703531 i expect a surge of content producers moving to this media player it has been my pleasure to work with wizzard in the development of a media player that exceeds my own lofty expectations it is exactly what i was looking for
4703532 will the macbook air receive an update sources claim yes expect penryn processors and a higher capacity battery
4703533 video might contain artifacts like overexposure and low resolution imagery
4703534 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4703535 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4703536 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4703537 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4703538 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4703539 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4703540 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4703541 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4703542 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4703543 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4703544 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4703545 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4703546 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4703547 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4703548 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4703549 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4703550 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4703551 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4703552 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4703553 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4703554 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4703555 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4703556 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4703557 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4703558 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4703559 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4703560 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4703561 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4703562 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4703563 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4703564 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4703565 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4703566 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4703567 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4703568 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4703569 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4703570 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4703571 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4703572 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4703573 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4703574 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4703575 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4703576 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4703577 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4703578 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4703579 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4703580 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4703581 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4703582 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4703583 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4703584 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4703585 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4703586 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4703587 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4703588 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4703589 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4703590 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4703591 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4703592 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4703593 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4703594 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4703595 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4703596 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4703597 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4703598 i always wondered what my feelings would be i feel a tremendous load off my back somebody told me years ago you judge ones character by the company you keep and im just happy to be in the company of michael phelps thats the bottom line
4703599 im so proud of what hes been able to do
4703600 i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4703601 well better to be called p o than c o
4703602 hey were rich and theyre poor so give em some money

4703606 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4703607 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4703608 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4703609 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4703610 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4703611 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4703612 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4703613 si ustedes no ven a un hombre durante tres dias y luego lo vuelven a ver no tendrian la seguridad de que se trate del mismo hombre y qu eocurre conustedes
4703614 theyd started to cast it but then 9 11 happened and that seemed to harpoon all kinds of transgressive comedies
4703615 he has the option hes written the screenplay and has said several times that its going to be his project after i am legend
4703616 i kind of wrote snuff with the idea that it might eventually be a stage play
4703617 by keeping the number of settings and the number of characters really limited it seemed like the situation would be perfect for a play
4703618 he knew what he was doing thats the first thing we sat for long hours listening to music before we decided what we would do and selecting various things
4703619 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4703620 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4703621 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip

4703687 overall the battlefield care is much better than even in desert storm one its really not what the doctors are doing its soldiers taking care of themselves soldiers taking care of each other the best trained medics weve ever had the most courageous medics weve ever had
4703688 we train them to do very quickly what emts and even paramedics do in the civilian sector they learn fast theyre 18 year old kids and they know theyre going to be using those skills and theyre paying attention because they know that they themselves could be one of the patients dont underestimate what an 18 year old kid who decided to defer college to serve his or her country can learn they can learn a hell of a lot
4703689 getting definitive care on the battlefield at the point of injury i think attests to most of the lifesaving on the battlefield if you stop a bleed soon keep a wound clean at the point of injury its saving hundreds of lives
4703690 the army can make the best equipment in the world for burns best equipment to stop bullets best helmets and things like that but if they dont make it comfortable soldiers will not wear it no matter how expensive no matter how much money they spend i know from experience if its not comfortable to wear in iraq where its 100 degrees if you dont make something that can breathe thats comfortable to wear soldiers arent going to wear it its not doing any good if its lying on the side of the road or in the vehicle and theyre not wearing it

4703708 it is very difficult to say at this point whether after the olympics chinese society will become more open
4703709 there is always back and forth struggles between the authorities and the grass roots and citizens
4703710 theres still a lot of tension and the grass roots need to push their work forward
4703711 it has played a great role whether its about banning disposable chopsticks or sorting trash everyone at the mention of the olympics said they should do a better job
4703712 but since the olympics is already here the government had no choice but to move the agenda ahead

4703722 im sure this is to the liking of the u s government
4703723 but hes a bit too square in not taking advantage of this rare chance he could have used this to boost his popularity
4703724 without us the level of play in the u s is so low
4703725 they use chinese players because they can get good results quickly
4703726 theres something unseemly about gold medalists who have rarely stepped foot on their home countrys soil who might not know the words to the national anthem or speak the official language s

4703729 beliau secara terbuka menegaskan bahawa beliau tidak rela diliwat dan diliwat secara paksa sedangkan dalam pertuduhan yang dikenakan ke atas datuk seri anwar ibrahim adalah seksyen 377b kanun keseksaan iaitu dakwaan melakukan hubungan seks di luar tabii terhadap saiful secara sukarela
4703730 justeru dalam kes ini yang mana satu terpakai suka sama suka ataupun secara paksa
4703731 sebelum ini timbalan perdana menteri najib tun razak mengakui saiful datang bertemunya pada 25 jun 2008 untuk melaporkan mengenai saiful diliwat beberapa kali
4703732 keraguan juga timbul apakah tujuan sebenar saiful menemui najib pada 25 jun 2008 tersebut sekiranya beliau hanya diliwat pada 26 jun 2008 sebagaimana didakwa semalam
4703733 amk berpegang teguh atas prinsip yang ditegaskan oleh ulama tersohor dunia sheikh taha jabir melalui fatwanya bahawa persoalan sumpah langsung tidak disebut oleh para ahli fekah
4703734 adalah lebih tepat bagi saiful untuk membawa kes ini mengikut akta kesalahan jenayah syariah wilayah persekutuan 1997 berbanding sumpah laknat yang tidak boleh digunapakai dalam kes ini
4703735 amk juga percaya sepenuhnya bahawa sumpah laknat saiful ini lebih bersifat politik meskipun beliau menafikannya

4703769 were just not as big and physical as we used to be
4703770 through the years weve been more of a rushing team but weve converted the last two years to throwing it more and i expect to continue the trend
4703771 blood wasnt going to make the discus slip out of my hands
4703772 but i dont know if thats the reason i threw so bad
4703773 maybe by then ill be good enough that i can get a medal
4703774 some of these guys had older brothers who played here and won state championships

4703783 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4703784 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4703785 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4703786 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4703787 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4703788 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4703789 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4703790 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4703791 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4703792 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4703793 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4703794 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4703795 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4703796 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4703797 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4703798 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4703799 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4703800 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4703801 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4703802 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4703803 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4703804 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4703805 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4703806 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4703807 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4703808 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4703809 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4703810 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4703811 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4703812 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4703813 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4703814 these people are running out of places to go and basic necessities
4703815 the tigers are keeping them in harms way and the government is not doing enough to ensure they receive essential assistance
4703816 both sides to this long conflict have again shown that they will jeopardize the lives of thousands of ordinary people in the pursuit of military objectives

4703828 if anyone would have said before the games that id win two golds and break the world record id have laughed in their face i never thought it
4703829 i knew when i touched the wall i was going to win the gold but i didnt expect to get the record and by that much its unbelievable
4703830 its always been a goal of mine to do this i never really expected i could do it at this moment in time but its always been in the back of my mind

4703832 ideologies may be power structures that manipulate human action but they are also ideational systems that enable us to choose to become what we want to become
4703833 the social imaginary is that common understanding which makes possible common practices and a widely shared sense of legitimacy
4703834 comprehensive belief systems composed of patterned ideas and claims to truth codified by social elites these beliefs are embraced by significant groups in society
4703835 an ideology attempts to end the inevitable contention over concepts by decontesting them by removing their meanings from contest
4703836 charles taylor argues that the social imaginary is neither a theory nor an ideology but an implicit

4703854 im hoping they realize that having an al teacher on campus for one day is not enough to meet the needs of the al kids
4703855 even though all the boxes might be checked im not sure the spirit of whats intended is whats being met
4703856 they did not believe that those children were being challenged
4703857 that they were given more work to do not necessarily richer or deeper

4703859 we toured the outside of yad vashem the holocaust museum and the coolest thing happened when we were in the valley of the communities while we were having a short memorial service a pure yellow butterfly flew over us it was one of the most meaningful experiences in my life the butterfly was so moving because recently we had been studying the holocaust in school we read the poem i never saw another butterfly that poem was written by a young boy in theterezin ghetto during wwii

4703861 were growing into the selfless people im pretty sure god wants us to be
4703862 we returned to a project we had done earlier in the week d c central kitchen prepares meals and foods for various outreach programs around the city on one evening we peeled and chopped carrots for three hours and on another evening we shucked corn
4703863 when the deck was completely finished and carl was sitting on his new deck he made the comment that he thought there werent any more good people left in this world especially young people he also said that we had given him hope it was really amazing to know that we had been able to show him through the work we had done that there still are really good young people left in the world it amazed me to know that with only three days of work we could do so much to help someone this experience gave me a new look on what i do because now i know that even small things can make a big difference on someones life i hope that i will be able to do more mission trips and help even more people
4703864 in this sport its never any fun if youre not winning
4703865 its been a great year and we could never really ask for more
4703866 but you hope that the success can continue and you can hope that you can have a shot for the championship when its all said and done
4703867 its going to be pretty tough to beat jimmie johnson carl edwards and of course greg biffle is good here
4703868 it was there from the first lap the first turn
4703869 we tried some things during practice that didnt work at all
4703870 so we went back to where we were and i think thats one of the best qualifying cars ive ever had it was a heck of a lap
4703871 at the time sedgefield had a different membership after being here 16 straight years some of the members felt we had worn out our welcome now theres a new membership and they wanted us back
4703872 this is the biggest crowd we have had on thursday and friday for many many years
4703873 things are always on my mind but ive got to put willie nelson out of the back of my head and go ahead and try to win
4703874 a few guys have come up and said they knew jim
4703875 as soon as i did that my mind kind of set in and i played nice all day
4703876 i just had a brief moment thinking about it but then i was kind of laughing at myself
4703877 i felt i had momentum going with me and it wasnt that hard of a shot
4703878 this city is like his retirement fund he plays good here every year i dont think anybodys going to beat him this week
4703879 the tour courses have been set up hard so its a nice change to be really aggressive and sedgefield kind of suits my style
4703880 i try to play really aggressive all the time and so far its paid off great
4703881 if we get no wind and the greens are soft again absolutely
4703882 some guys are going to go crazy low because theyre that good with the short stick i hope i can keep up
4703883 cavic said it would be good for swimming and good for me if he won
4703884 once youre able to look at them as guys doing the same thing youre doing and knowing you can compete then you known you can have a good chance out here
4703885 hopefully i can keep putting myself in good positions and eventually the right thing will happen
4703886 when we struggled at the world championships a big reason was not having lisa in the hole
4703887 for our perimeter players they know if lisa is behind them and they get beat off the dribble shes there to at least change the shot if not block it her influence on the court you cant put it into words off the court she sets the standard for sure
4703888 i like where my game is going into next week
4703889 partisan ethics complaints such as this one that are based on nothing more than wild hearsay and unsupported accusations and designed to do nothing more than grab cheap headlines and damage the reputations of public officials
4703890 i think that theyve got to build up their relationships with their crew chiefs and build up whoever those guys are going to be and get that organization to where its running a little bit better
4703891 the hardest part of starting a new team is usually you come out of the box good but its when you get into the summer months and you start crashing cars and things start going wrong its how you rebound from that
4703892 i think tony needs to have guys he knows that have won races before that helps the team
4703893 when youve won you have certain ideas for what you need at certain race tracks
4703894 the more successful the organization and the team is the less the driver has to have that input or give that quarterback leadership
4703895 its going to take some time from a building standpoint from a personal standpoint to be where we want to be as far as the chase goes and championship contending teams
4703896 the citizens deserve peace and that some infringement of constitutional rights is ok
4703897 why do we need three vice principals at cchs that is excessive
4703898 if that need was there there would be no need for a reduction in work force
4703899 it is not in the best interest of this school district to reduce the administration
4703900 what we are trying to do is save everyones jobs this year there is no change in salary for that individual
4703901 i see these fires as part of an ecological transition
4703902 unfortunately some of our policymakers dont seem to take that message to heart
4703903 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4703904 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4703905 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4703906 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4703907 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4703908 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4703909 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4703910 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4703911 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4703912 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4703913 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4703914 this is a planning took where all things are going
4703915 he had a deep commitment to serving his country and was willing to make the ultimate sacrifice
4703916 dan believed deeply in the cause for which he was fighting
4703917 he died doing what he believed in what he believed god had created him to do and called him to do
4703918 if you judge a book by its cover then i am already read
4703919 el mundo ha visto con inquietud c mo rusia invad a un estado soberano vecino y amenazaba a un gobierno elegido democr ticamente por su pueblo

4703922 this means that anyone who belongs to christ has become a new person the old life is gone a new life has begun

4703929 he covers issues of interest to all aboriginal peoples from around the world not just native americans
4703930 i do not feel we should forfeit the traditional rights and privileges of the natives of our islands for a mere thimbleful of votes in congress that we the lovers of hawaii from long association with it should sacrifice our birthright for the greed of alien desires to remain on our shores

4703973 oh dear i see why you were so worried then
4703974 i said id explain later and now that were all here ill tell you
4703975 ayaka and i have been keeping in constant contact all throughout the formation of the s m a t forces she had told me about all the great things you girls have done for us mutants particularly how you were coming close to changing the whole stereotype of how all mutants are dangerous and had won over the trust of many people unfortunately i did not have that courage when i discovered my own mutant abilities a couple of years ago i was so afraid of what others might think of my new abilities that i left h p and headed to america under the whole pretense that i was going there to study music however i went there just to isolate myself so i could have time to come to terms with what i was ayaka and i kept in contact with each other the whole time though it was a very big surprise to find out how many of you were mutants just like me if i had known i might not have left at that time i thought i was the only mutant monster in the whole world a couple of days ago i got an urgent message from ayaka which told me about the whole situation between you and japans police and military upon hearing the news i immediately departed for japan on my personal jet during the flight i was watching the news as well and heard of the order to arrest all h p girls since i used to be one i knew that it was far too dangerous to actually land in japan so i had my crew set down on a small island about 100 km east of japan at that point i immediately began construction on this island thanks to the help of my army of robot inventions who worked tirelessly 24 hours a day weve completed this new extremely high tech headquarters for you and your s m a t forces
4703976 hmm id say about 1 000 give or take a couple hundred
4703977 and just how did you come to have that many
4703978 except my abilities are far more advanced i can create some of the most complex inventions with mere thought alone here watch
4703979 wow i think thats quite possibly the coolest mutant ability i have ever seen
4703980 i have yet to find any limit to the type or size of invention i could create
4703981 but i do tend to get slight headaches after i create larger inventions with my mind
4703982 please try to remember do you know what happened to it
4703983 im sorry but you have no idea how important that watch was it belonged to ishibashi he gave it to me for safekeeping he he might not even know that im still alive if i left it behind
4703984 oh dear i see why you were so worried then
4703985 hmm id say about 1 000 give or take a couple hundred

4703999 journalists as all other civilians in the conflict zone must be protected from hostilities
4704000 human rights monitors including from intergovernmental human rights bodies should be allowed full access to the conflict zone
4704001 moreover prior to the ceasefire there had been reports that humanitarian aid had been prevented from getting through to civilians trapped in the conflict zone
4704002 for example russian media reported that russian aid could not get through to tskhinvali on 11 august due to ongoing hostilities on 12 august the international committee of the red cross icrc stated that its access to south ossetia to deliver aid was being hampered by the intense fighting

4704054 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4704055 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4704056 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4704057 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4704058 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4704059 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4704060 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4704061 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life

4704065 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4704066 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something

4704073 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4704074 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4704075 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4704076 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4704077 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4704078 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4704079 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4704080 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

4704165 anwar is the one who really has the ability to negotiate and bring the pakatan rakyat together in agreement he is the de facto leader of the opposition but it really hangs on him standing for the by election and winning to take on the role properly
4704166 anwar will be a formidable challenger in parliament to the government it will be another platform for him to criticise the government as well as to propose new things
4704167 after so many years under the bn it is an opportunity for the opposition to use the by election to explain what they are offering and how objective they would be in running the country
4704168 as i see it the question is not whether anwar can win but whether he can win with a bigger majority it will signify for one a confirmation and ratification of the 8 march political tsunami it will be a clear message for the last half of the year that the pm has not learnt the lessons of the political tsunami and about the peoples deepest hopes and aspirations for democratic change
4704169 it is a jihad because this individual should not be given the chance to destroy the countrys political stability and prosperity if we allow him to lead the country he would lead us to destruction
4704170 anwar would be a fiery ferocious opposition leader in parliament
4704171 if he wins it will really have an impact on the government and umno vis vis the transition plan for the partys leadership but if he loses that has great implications on the kind of democratisation that some of us think has been opening up namely the path to what is ultimately a two party system
4704172 it a pr government has positive implications for democracy it is good for malaysia good for governance as there will be better checks and balances and consequently less corruption and good for the economy because investors will have more confidence in the government

4704194 en primer lugar preocupan el conflicto armado y el postconflicto en la seguridad ciudadana de bogot los desplazados por la violencia que se instalan en los anillos de mayor vulnerabilidad los grupos armados ilegales que tienen presencia en la capital la ciudad debe tener trabajo de inteligencia por parte de las autoridades respectivas es decir tener informaci n que permita la prevenci n de estos problemas tenemos que seguir trabajando en los homicidios y los delitos de alto impacto necesitamos que cambien factores estructurales como el porte ilegal de armas y el tema del esclarecimiento de delitos y de cr menes que es fundamental para bajar las cifras

4704209 tonalism is probably the most misunderstood underestimated and underappreciated movement in australian art history and yet it was hugely important to the development of 20th century art in this country
4704210 max meldrum was a pioneer but he was also terribly divisive there was a certain stigma attached to him and his followers which still remains today even some of the most beautiful tonalist paintings have often been ignored or dismissed by the art world until now
4704211 traditionally meldrum has been associated with conservatism however it is surprising to realise that his theories influenced many of australias most innovative modernists

4704280 it is very difficult to say at this point whether after the olympics chinese society will become more open
4704281 there is always back and forth struggles between the authorities and the grass roots and citizens
4704282 theres still a lot of tension and the grass roots need to push their work forward
4704283 it has played a great role whether its about banning disposable chopsticks or sorting trash everyone at the mention of the olympics said they should do a better job
4704284 but since the olympics is already here the government had no choice but to move the agenda ahead
4704285 still has a long ways to go in engaging with civil society as true partners

4704302 he is absolute in his justice seeking beautifully informational staunchly analytical and a joy to behold i consider it both a duty and a delight to keep coming back here
4704303 upon only a first and second look i d say you should read everything posted by voice of a native son
4704304 intelligentaindigena has great commentary and interesting links that will always make you leaving the site a little more wiser
4704305 an extraordinary blogger posting on news from around the world for issues dealing with oppression of any kind
4704306 he covers issues of interest to all aboriginal peoples from around the world not just native americans
4704307 i do not feel we should forfeit the traditional rights and privileges of the natives of our islands for a mere thimbleful of votes in congress that we the lovers of hawaii from long association with it should sacrifice our birthright for the greed of alien desires to remain on our shores

4704309 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4704310 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4704311 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4704312 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4704313 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4704314 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4704315 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4704316 the way you perceive cats is the way theyre going to act
4704317 if you treat them like spoiled babies thats what theyll be like but if you have the mentality that they are intelligent and loyal friends thats exactly what they will be
4704318 you only want to work with two cats at a time
4704319 they are so individualized they are just like people that way
4704320 people live in their front yards theres a mix of ages some neighbors are like grandparents to the children on the street it really has a sense of community
4704321 i respectfully disagree if a house is beautiful i dont care if its twice the size of the one next to it it should only be a problem if its ugly
4704322 they dont look at it separately as land and house but by law we have to split it out
4704323 if land costs are going up something has to give on the other end
4704324 because we cant adjust the total it has to equal 100 percent of the market thats why you see a lot of properties on lake washington that may only have 1 000 value on the house because the real value is in the land
4704325 we figured out that this was the 135th game played together for nine of these 11 girls
4704326 friday when we won it was the first time we saw them jumping up and down crying and hugging each other
4704327 when she doubled off that runner at third watching the girls reaction was so exciting
4704328 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4704329 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4704330 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4704331 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4704332 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4704333 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4704334 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4704335 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4704336 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4704337 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4704338 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4704339 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4704340 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4704341 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4704342 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4704343 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4704344 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4704345 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4704346 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4704347 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4704348 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4704349 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4704350 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing
4704351 i tried to be very concentrated on the game not to be more emotionally involved
4704352 ive been coaching with the u s team for the last four years this is not the first time weve played against china
4704353 every point for our team is very important dont think about the result even if we lose the game every point is important we have to fight for the result
4704354 the players played very brave and played very aggressively especially when we were down 1 2 after the third set
4704355 lang ping is the role model for every chinese female volleyball player
4704356 shes now coaching the u s team and she has helped them improve and change their style
4704357 i think our players are more emotional very passionate sometimes too much
4704358 i need to balance it if it gets too high i have to settle it or if too low i have to raise it like a cheerleader

4704362 despite pledging to run a respectful campaign mccain is just standing by while corsi and his publisher former dick cheney aide mary matalin poison this presidential race
4704363 right now you can take the next step by pushing back on corsi the media and john mccain tackle this smear campaign head on
4704364 obama wants to will all the white blood out of himself so he can become pure black
4704365 unfit for command swift boat veterans speak out against john kerry
4704366 it taught you that you have to trust the guy next to you that will transfer to the field
4704367 you need the guys around you to help you get across
4704368 once we got the kinks out and started to get a little togetherness established it was a breeze
4704369 these guys really showed their dedication some of these guys could easily be soldiers they were willing to do anything and work as a team and it showed
4704370 oh baby oh baby im home where is the fried chicken
4704371 it jammed up on me but i got two turkeys
4704372 you can tell these guys have a lot of pride and they want to do the best they can and then do some smack talking
4704373 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters
4704374 that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4704375 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time hes the greatest racer who ever walked the planet
4704376 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4704377 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4704378 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race
4704379 coming down here has changed my whole thought because we are coming together we are coming together without any computers and no phones to be with our brothers and we are all brothers it is good
4704380 actually hes a funny guy once you get to know him
4704381 i can see hes a little more laid back a little more relaxed with us we feel more confident that he has a lot more confidence in us hes not uptight all the time
4704382 you always have your small group of friends that you hang out with on the weekend
4704383 here were in a totally different environment no one can go anywhere were stuck with each other thats just how it is
4704384 i get a chance to hang out with guys i never really hung out with before
4704385 i get a chance to see how funny they are and they get a chance to see how funny we are
4704386 they got their phones going off all the way until 3 in the morning and im trying to get some sleep its killing me
4704387 any time you throw a group of guys on a bus and go anywhere thats great because they all get to know each other a little bit better
4704388 there are so many similarities man teamwork listening to everybody
4704389 sometimes you cant be the biggest talker sometimes you have to listen because someone might have a better idea than you its big
4704390 i guess some guys in the past have kind of separated from the team concept but it sounds like theyre gone
4704391 this is a good group willie tuitama and ronnie palmer are great leaders
4704392 then you have cam and nate guys respect them because they work so hard
4704393 everyone is in good spirits and the last time i was down here it really wasnt like that i feel so much better to be out here and having fun were having fun playing basketball and having fun with each other
4704394 there was so much tension last season it was good to see them and im sure they will do well next year
4704395 it was great to be around these former wildcats the family atmosphere said former ua player joseph blair
4704396 you can see the dedication and loyalty we have to the program
4704397 save my legs for the season i cant come in here and play anymore
4704398 i didnt surprise myself i knew i could do that kind of stuff said bayless who averaged 29 8 points in the summer league
4704399 i just wasnt allowed to do that stuff at ua whatever though it was a great experience
4704400 now if people are interested because they heard something happened i guess its a positive i could go out and play a clean match and people will ask why i didnt get mad

4704411 we are working together with the convention committee on many levels to ensure a successful convention this year
4704412 as we announced earlier moving forward one of sen obamas reform priorities will include changes in the way party conventions are funded to assure they can be run without dependence
4704413 both conventions are bringing in new fundraisers connected with the presidential candidate to go the last mile
4704414 the ad calls on people to support the freedom to marry
4704415 in the midst of an initiative campaign this kind of call to action advocacy should be seen as lobbying against the current initiative
4704416 is untethered to any political moment election year political decision or vote it is all about asking people how they would feel if they or their loved ones couldnt marry who they love
4704417 running a campaign of this size and scope is costing millions of dollars
4704418 this is our chance to put all our time hard work and money into changing the climate in california this is the time to do whatever you can and all you can
4704419 it is clearly use of a loophole in the law
4704420 whether it is an effective campaign tool is a different matter clearly theyre trying to set a soft message in place to get the electorate ready for the battle that is likely to come
4704421 the ad helps educate voters so they can make up their own minds
4704422 californias politicians have proven time and again that if you give them 1 they will spend 1 05
4704423 it seems to me the objective of this proposal is clearly to promote less government
4704424 i dont think your proposal allows any practical flexibility to deal with real life crises
4704425 it indicates to us that our fundraising continues to be very healthy
4704426 so well be spending much more than weve been raising
4704427 john mccains decision to raise money from one of the key figures in the jack abramoff scandal one of abramoffs conspirators in a money laundering scheme is a very disappointing example of john mccain abandoning his principles on the campaign trail
4704428 he claimed to be a reformer well reformer no more
4704429 we go into the fall if nothing else a tested organization
4704430 this is like a high stakes trapeze act that these guys have because mistakes and gaffes matter oh so much in these contests
4704431 he has the energy and the forward looking vision to lead
4704432 he has to deal with the ghost on the stage and probably has to do that in a dramatic way
4704433 people will be looking for obama to demonstrate a mastery of the questions
4704434 keeping him on an even keel at all times and not letting the situation rattle him in any way
4704435 he very seldom lets his emotions get the better of him which i think is very helpful
4704436 is a very nuanced thinker and thats good but sometimes in the expression of that it bogs him down a little bit so hes not as direct a speaker or performer as the best debaters have been
4704437 the mission is nothing short of protecting the panama canal and the lines of communication that go with it

4704448 the players are talking about how the practice facility is great and about how the food is good they like everything probably this will lead into both sides wanting to do this again maybe even a little longer
4704449 we needed to do something that was going to provide a little bit of a break
4704450 of course if the numbers are overwhelming thats all going to be out the door
4704451 if were inundated with a bunch of civil unrest it doesnt matter how well we prepare if we get severe numbers its going to take us forever
4704452 its just ridiculous the thing looks like a dog pound
4704453 obama is not a marxist or a radical yet it is clear that radicals have influenced his judgment
4704454 these books are cut from the same cloth made up of the same old debunked smears that have been floating around the internet for months
4704455 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him

4704491 i dunno but it sure is a good deal lets get it
4704492 pulitzer prize winning journalist ron suskind joins us for part two of an interview on his new book
4704493 the government isnt doing enough to encourage private and third sector project bids to benefit from eu funding
4704494 i congratulate the two private sector companies on finding their way through the difficult assembly government maze of securing funding from the new round of structural funds
4704495 the number of approved projects for eu funding is very low with only two projects coming from the private sector
4704496 since the start of the funding round the number of approved projects equates to around one project a month being approved
4704497 this european money is used to tackle regional disparities and support regional development and i dont want wales to be losing out on the advantages this money provides as it is very unlikely that wales would receive money in the next round of eu funding
4704498 the key to using the opportunities offered by the eu structural funds is the creation of favourable conditions in which public private and third sector prospective bidders are given maximum opportunity of receiving funding that way we get the best projects coming forward
4704499 the assembly government needs to provide more assistance to interested groups to meet the demanding criteria it has set the welsh european funding office
4704500 private and third sector interested bodies may encounter difficulties in preparing a comprehensive market analysis or long term impact studies all demanding requirements from the wefo
4704501 the assembly government needs to do all it can to ensure that none of the eu money gets sent back at the end of the spending period and that the benefits of the projects are realised as rapidly as possible
4704502 i saw a shadow on the side of my goggles

4704504 there was no way she could beat the first two girls but i knew she could close
4704505 my coach said before the race to fall asleep for a couple laps and then give it a go
4704506 i was just running so within myself trying to stay calm
4704507 i couldnt celebrate because i thought i might have been fourth
4704508 in my era it all started with deena kastor winning bronze in athens 2004 in the marathon
4704509 that made us really dream big i think kara reinforced it

4704751 he carries a 3 9 grade point average there are very few football players that have his athletic ability those brains and get along with his teammates as well as he does
4704752 and that the relationship with his teammates that is his strength
4704753 i just thought it was an inappropriate call i called upstairs and i never do
4704754 hes a nightmare hes one of the best running backs weve ever faced
4704755 we are still working on too many drops we have to do a better job of concentrating and focusing
4704756 this is a good group when they work hard and they focus and pay attention to detail they are pretty average when they dont
4704757 when we are not doing something right coach dykes has to let us know and that is his way of telling us we were not doing our jobs we bounced back it was good to see that from the offense we have a lot of weapons across the board
4704758 they have to step up their game and have to understand that in this offense you have to rely on these guys
4704759 you have to be able to rely on them every single down we are working through that
4704760 we are going to play five games on the road this year so when you can pack your gear up and go to an environment you are not used to i think it is good for your players especially our young players
4704761 this is the first time they have traveled and been in this kind of an environment and have a chance to go out and perform
4704762 its important that our team take good care of him right now
4704763 our team needs to keep him in the loop an injury like that to an athlete is a difficult situation
4704764 but we have a good group of guys on this team and good team chemistry and its their job to keep him in the loop
4704765 im just trying to make good contact there and i crushed the ball
4704766 the first pitch was a fastball then im watching his release on the next pitch and the fastball comes again and i got all of it
4704767 the guys put us in a spot to win the ballgame and i screwed it up in the ninth
4704768 it was a situation when i didnt execute my pitch and he ward made me pay for it
4704769 jesse what up we just got back from downtown and we need to call some cabs
4704770 oh ok good to be safe hope you guys didnt work too hard tonight
4704771 damn havent seen you in a while you guys must be busy
4704772 ummmmm guy this is a 2 4 table the max you can bet is 4 i think i wont bet against you this game
4704773 oh shit bad place you know they gonna find him

4704775 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

4704779 oh i am going to do a few push ups every night
4704780 that game that loss thats been on my mind probably every day since then
4704781 i think the initial sense ive had here is the parents want the kids to be involved in something thats positive
4704782 every school every team has parents that put pressure on the coaches to win and succeed and i dont think thats any different here
4704783 he should be back to around 2 000 yards passing like weve had here in the past
4704784 but with a senior line with our passing game looking good and i hit the gym hard all offseason im pretty excited about what could happen this year
4704785 our roster numbers arent real high coach mario pi a said
4704786 the key is to keep our kids healthy and focused on the season
4704787 the kids are getting used to the system pi a said
4704788 were more comfortable with it theyre able to do a little more with it
4704789 i look at it as a learning experience and now we have a chance to come back and do even better
4704790 we thought we would compete last year in our first year of varsity but we had a rash of injuries
4704791 was a little more than he has had in the past
4704792 his stuff was down a little from what we saw in the rehab starts
4704793 tommy was trying to get through it but he didnt feel as good as he liked
4704794 to walk on stage to all that applause wow man wer were all caught off guard getting something before youve done anything thats almost like real love i guess
4704795 the whole idea is to promote hindi in europe if hindi dies among second generation indians from north india in europe their links with india will also die as language is a crucial aspect of culture so we thought that inculcating love of the language was important for inculcating the love of india
4704796 we found that hindi was ignored so we began this initiative
4704797 in 2002 i organised the first hindi competition in london and gave prizes to many students the next year we extended it to the whole of britain and later to different parts of europe between 400 600 students take part in the competition each year
4704798 i didnt know how to use a computer before this week things change you just have to keep on going
4704799 my mum never ceases to amaze me whatever she does i am amazed she is having a second youth as far as we know my mum is the oldest person on facebook before her the oldest person was 97
4704800 weve come to the end of our one week experiment tweeting
4704801 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

4704813 he would say all the time im sick of this
4704814 said enos one of osullivans favorite targets at uc davis
4704815 there was something about him even when he first came here
4704816 there was just an air of confidence and thats something you look for in a quarterback some would say its arrogance but its not arrogance its confidence and his confidence comes from his preparation
4704817 i dont know how long hes spent with this offense but you can tell he knows it hes very confident and thats huge
4704818 no one talks when j t s talking and if they are theyre not talking for long
4704819 he said were going to make this play and were going to celebrate in the end zone
4704820 it was like the clouds parted for that one instant
4704821 after a couple of teams theres a sense that youre just a journeyman
4704822 to be honest with you i havent sat down and thought about it and evaluated each little situation as far as what happened in each organization
4704823 but if it didnt work out somewhere then my attitude was that i just wasnt good enough to make that team anything else is an excuse
4704824 you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go
4704825 mark is a little put off by this i think generally he has been very supportive of phelps i talk about their basically nonexistent relationship in the book mark wishes him well but i think deep down laugh hed like to see him get seven instead of eight
4704826 is that i recently watched tapes of mark at the 1972 games and it struck me that he didnt have any close races he and phelps you cant compare them the training was different the nutrition was different the pools were different but there are similarities personality wise
4704827 i am thrilled we have artest off of our hands he was a detriment
4704828 i would say he would be the guy thats out front right now
4704829 last year was more of a learning year this year i feel more confident in my decision making
4704830 i think having played and been through the experience its like seeing a movie for the second time
4704831 you see everything much more clear and i think hes showing that in camp so far
4704832 he knows where hes going with the ball i really expect him to make a big jump from last year to this year
4704833 he has the belief in himself that he can always get the ball in there and sometimes you know you cant
4704834 getting in the game and playing at that high speed is going to help me
4704835 its more of a confidence an inner confidence to know that you can deliver those balls in a game situation
4704836 every day coach is going to throw something new at you and youve got to overcome that
4704837 if youre in the backup position youve got to push the starter as much as you can
4704838 if youre in the starting position youve got to push ahead and keep your job every week
4704839 he hasnt been able to settle in i think hes made tremendous strides from spring to fall he just needs reps

4704863 we had been thinking about buying a home in spain for about 10 years and did lots of research into companies building in spain
4704864 cala magrana 2 ticked all the boxes for us flight times to mallorca are short from edinburgh airport which is just a few miles from where we live the development is just two minutes from the sea and at cala mandia beach there is a scuba diving school
4704865 were also within walking distance of the marina of porto cristo which is beautiful and within easy reach of several superb golf courses we also like the region because it hasnt been spoilt by too many english pubs the spanish culture is still strong here which is important to us
4704866 we love to make the most of the weather by being outside as much as we can we particularly enjoy being able to eat on the terrace as the weather in scotland usually doesnt lend itself to meals outdoors as well as being a sound investment our home is now our haven in the sun
4704867 someday the truth about her is going to come out

4704873 i was at the beverly hilton i was there for a very simple reason because i was trying to keep this mistake that i had made from becoming public
4704874 woodruff did you want to control ms hunter to some degree in the sense that you didnt want her to reveal this relationship edwards i wanted her not to tell the public what had happened very simple thats the reason i went
4704875 edwards if youre talking about fred baron i do know fred baron i also know that fred baron knows both of these people who are involved and has worked with them for years so he has the relationship with them independent of me so what he chose to do or not do i cant explain hell have to explain i dont know what he did or why he did it and what his reasons for were for doing it is it possible that he wanted to help them because they were in a difficult time of course is it possible that he was worried that in fact something had happened with me and he wanted to help of course thats possible i think all these things are possible
4704876 i cant explain hell have to explain i dont know what he did or why he did it and what his reasons for were for doing it is it possible that he wanted to help them because they were in a difficult time of course
4704877 possible that he wanted to help them because they were in a difficult time
4704878 he said ms hunter and another edwards aide andrew young who claimed paternity of ms hunters child were being dogged by tabloid reporters chasing rumors of the affair and pregnancy
4704879 i made a decision on my own without talking to edwards or anybody to try to help them move to a community to try to get away from those folks

4704901 were going to rely more on our running backs this year
4704902 our line was young last year and we didnt score against teams when we needed to score said second year head coach jim monaco
4704903 we came up empty were looking to work on our red zone offense now that our quarterback has a year under his belt
4704904 we have to play much more consistent casa grande coach tracy stuart said
4704905 we had a group that was here for two years that grabbed most of the playing time we were extremely young last year stuart said
4704906 weve gotten some great work from our linebackers and secondary stuart said
4704907 were looking for those groups to be pretty strong for us
4704908 im very fortunate to be where i am im excited about this season
4704909 weve got to find a way to get those guys the ball
4704910 we lost three games in the final 30 seconds of games and the hope is these guys learned from that and will learn to close out games
4704911 weve got some talented kids who look promising who we are going to build on holland said

4704925 the chairman of new york college donald spector contributed the technology to the college under our ip policy mr spectors donations to the college have been appraised at about 10 000 000 though the college hopes the developed products will bring in a continuous stream of income
4704926 mr spector one of the most prolific inventors in the world has licensed products to many fortune 500 companies including the introduction of the first electronic fragrance dispensing system the aroma disc system to squibb now bristol myers squibb nyse bmy www bms com as well as other dominating technologies in air fresheners exercise equipment pharmaceuticals and internet technologies and many other areas
4704927 western medicine has made dramatic strides in the past decades and has saved millions of lives
4704928 however side effects and contraindications demand that many of these drugs be used as a last resort eastern medicine can provide chronic relief and in some cases like with migraine headaches instant relief inexpensively and with no inconvenience
4704929 many of our products used to be viewed as alternative but today we use the term integrative and urge all patients to work with their doctors and practitioners to create a balanced program that includes exercise and nutrition
4704930 even though the clinical studies are not ready for publication about half of those patients already tested including some people who have suffered badly for years have their pain relieved in seconds with no side effects it would be against our mission not to make these products available to anyone who is in pain our money back guarantee insures that you have nothing to lose but your pain

4704933 during the summertime we have students with real challenges getting to their counseling sessions because there is a lack of public transportation
4704934 we thought that in addition to doing an update to the more traditional needs assessment we would take a stab at looking at what makes us a healthy community
4704935 i was struck by the fact that this added a lot of nuance to that conversation
4704936 we tend to look at affordable housing as one big package but really the affordable housing problem is the sum of some very different problems
4704937 these things occurred in part because the need was identified and people were willing to address it
4704938 what we look at is how we can chip away at those on a local level and in a way that is specific to bainbridge
4704939 if we were weak on something we were weak on commuters
4704940 its a good time to put all of that together and see what it tells us about our community
4704941 as gas prices reach higher and higher idling in traffic becomes more than just a time waster and source of frustration it can also lead to significant additional fuel costs
4704942 a typical user who encounters traffic on their daily commute can easily save 150 in gas in one year by using traffic vizzion were excited to bring these potential savings and benefits to the blackberry community
4704943 even though the center just opened we are already seeing great progress with the children here

4704946 the program is predicated on experience and integrity the foundations that are inseparable from our work as lawyers to advance the administration of justice
4704947 i feel that this book offers a different and exciting way of presenting the journey that is traveled by every believer while at the same time remaining individualized
4704948 the experiences encountered along the way although general in nature are still uniquely personal for every committed child of god this story despite the fact it is an allegory encourages and fortifies the true believer because it is scripturally sound and does not deviate from the truth as rendered in the word of god
4704949 as we continue to grow in the spanish translation market we recognized an increasing demand for high quality competitively priced multimedia solutions in spanish our clients were constantly requesting such services to the point where we found it necessary to form a separate division to address this important sector of the market

4704951 spanish post production will address the growing demand for quality spanish multimedia services for the us spanish speaking market and will be a critical part of trusted translations global strategy to provide the highest quality and most competitively priced spanish translation and related services in the us and abroad
4704952 this is exactly what the list should be that they are their own community

4704954 because we are an island community we will delete posts that are disparaging about another
4704955 were just a small enough group and there are always ways to get people the information
4704956 this unique character filled vehicle for our community doesnt need to be a vehicle for people to sell this stuff
4704957 i dont know how i functioned in a new community before things like this existed
4704958 its just really really great to know that you can create happy stories or have a part in the creation of happy stories
4704959 we are very happy about the transaction and we look forward to working together with the vantacore team
4704960 we are very pleased with the efforts of grandwood in initiating the transaction and executing the process in conjunction with southerns other advisors i feel they consistently worked extremely hard and went the extra step through difficult markets to achieve the best results for southern and its owners
4704961 firstly southern has extensive reserves and is an important aggregate supplier to baton rouge and lafayette two of the largest cities in louisiana second marc dyess with his extensive aggregate experience and louisiana market knowledge will add significant depth to the vantacore team his strategy of finding developing and marketing sand and gravel reserves has resulted in strong growth in sales and profits at southern third this acquisition extends vantacores geographic reach from our existing operations in tennessee while continuing to validate our growth strategy
4704962 this book is excellent for the christian community because it serves a dual purpose it not only teaches one how to pray and know god in a personal way but it is also a marvelous teaching tool for new convert classes this fascinating and timely book belongs in every home it gives a new and insightful perspective on how anyone can achieve a better life and is an appealing book which can be enjoyed by adults as well as young people

4704967 several of these items are draining our operating funds and many of these projects are close to completion
4704968 we literally have been fronting money with our cash flow weve spent most of the money to fund the projects already
4704969 at issue is how long we can keep this up
4704970 we are doing it every year paying for capital projects with debt how long can our revenue support this debt service
4704971 and that has to be factored into our ability to stay out of debt how much debt are we going to issue and for what and what are our future liabilities for things like litigation id like to know before we get further into debt
4704972 that we are aware of are offering municipally backed insurance
4704973 and has given verbal assurance that our bond rating will hold at 1a though we dont have it in writing yet we also have assurance from a securities firm that we still have a strong underlying rating and that were in good shape

4704975 it has become increasingly difficult to shift property and some sellers seem reluctant to fork out money to have these problems rectified
4704976 buyers should thoroughly inspect the property before making an offer ask sellers to move furniture lift floor coverings and check that heating water and electricity is in working order
4704977 in readiness for their completion date all buyers should ensure they have the right level of home insurance including emergency cover http www homeserve com insurance as this can save them a small fortune in the event they should unearth a problem they had not anticipated
4704978 these decisions have been haunting us for a long time and theyre finally settled to some degree not perfect but were moving forward
4704979 i dont understand why we are pitting the projects against each other
4704980 we can do both with the federal funds if we just take care of the safety and utility issues
4704981 i believe both need to be done but i dont think the best way is to federalize both projects
4704982 i support putting the grants together but id like a different approach for wing point way
4704983 our maintenance money has been deferred from wing point in the past and now its time for it to stop waiting and get its share of the preservation fund
4704984 this approach is a way to get both of these critical projects done in this community
4704985 the citys first responsibility is to keep our roads safe and clear and taking the money for a cfp project while well intentioned threatens our basic infrastructure its robbing peter to pay paul
4704986 i think it affordable housing is important for a relatively small part of the population this group has almost no power politically or financially when their few affordable choices for housing are threatened with replacement by more lucrative developments this also plays out in their ability to get ordinary repairs for their affordable apartments there is almost no motivation often by the housing authorities to make needed repairs because the people in question have little power to make things tough if nothing is done

4704989 it was one of those things that i just decided to do
4704990 as soon as i started in the water i kept saying expecto patronum and the image that kept coming up for me was a lion
4704991 every time i would put my hand in the water i would roar in my head it was that image and that strength that came to me
4704992 it was so awesome to find these guys and after a few minutes ashley said im going to do this next year
4704993 the group of women that participate is really diverse every age and body type you can imagine
4704994 and there are so many women who are still fighting breast cancer that are doing the race with you
4704995 thats part of why its so emotional no matter what youre struggling with its nothing compared to the fear they deal with every day
4704996 thats what made me cry like five times watching this whole thing
4704997 seeing the people who didnt grow up like i did and dont have the body type i do and who had to do it with a 120 pound pack on their back and braces on all their joints
4704998 it was so much harder for them to do it and when i saw them doing it with a look of elation it just made my heart break open and cry for joy for these people
4704999 i did lots of sports but i did them all badly
4705000 but once i was done with that career i didnt have a competitive streak left it had been beaten out of me because it was hard it was a hard life
4705001 now i want to support my friends and do something thats good for a lot of other people

4705005 this was completely inconceivable to me before a year ago
4705006 but i found out i have a lot more determination than i thought i did
4705007 people my whole life have told me that im strong and an inspiration ive heard that a lot but i never felt it i never believed in myself until i did the triathlon last year
4705008 i think its really inspiring to be part of these guys journey toward this finish line
4705009 im very proud of them theyve worked really hard and inspired me
4705010 i am fortunate to be able to do a good deed and you will do good deeds too
4705011 look this poor nudnick cut his fingers off i better make him a meal he needs to get better and his family needs help
4705012 our reading of the administrative record leaves us convinced that the vinikoor cared little about the evidence and instead applied whatever rationale he could muster to justify a predetermined outcome
4705013 we are appalled that vinikoor would rest his decision on the absurd proposition that bosede could evade imprisonment mistreatment and possibly death by trying to buy his way out
4705014 and to avoid repetition of the same mistakes the third time around we urge the agency to refer this case to a different immigration judge
4705015 bribery an irrational and altogether improper consideration in deciding a claim for asylum or other relief

4705047 i started by creating an inventory of fabric wall hangings under the name of fall to earth designs and i thought that the internet was the way to go because the quality and price of my work was upscale enough that it didnt fit in with most craft venues
4705048 i started with about 50 pieces and have sold a number of them but i knew that i needed another product to complement my own work my son recommended tapestry products which fits with my need for artistic expression and allows me to actually build the business rather than spending all of my time making products

4705424 het is een reactie op de kwaliteit van het huidige onderwijs
4705425 een gangmaker in de klas geen adhder maar wel druk
4705426 we werden aangesproken door iemand van school daar schrokken we van lodewijk was achteruitgegaan bij zijn toetsen wij wilden weten hoe dat kwam en wat we konden doen maar daar kwam geen antwoord op
4705427 er is vier tot zes uur extra les per week en extra aandacht voor hoogbegaafdheid dyslexie en dyscalculi
4705428 op florencius hebben we remedial teachers en een psycholoog en we stellen hogere eisen dan de overheid
4705429 het was en is een goede school de omnibus met bevlogen leerkrachten en goede rapporten van de inspectie
4705430 maar het is voor een reguliere school onmogelijk om alle kinderen zorg op maat te bieden reguliere basisscholen in nederland kampen vaak met grote problemen
4705431 altijd te weinig geld voor een cht mooi schoon gebouw grote klassen vieze wcs en onderwijs voor de middenmoot omdat er niet genoeg individuele begeleiding is rekenen en taal wordt er niet meer goed aangeleerd
4705432 er is geen maatwerk er is weinig aandacht voor andere manieren van leren creatieve vakken sport er zijn beperkte middelen slechts twee computers per klas de kwaliteit van het onderwijzend personeel is onvoldoende
4705433 kinderen weten tegenwoordig niks ze kunnen niks dat weet iedereen
4705434 maar het ministerie zegt dat er niets aan hand is het onderwijs is te modern geworden de nadruk op kennis is verschoven naar babbelen kinderen praten over de ozonlaag terwijl ze niet weten wat ozon is
4705435 een reactie op de alom aanwezige onvrede over het publieke onderwijs
4705436 in de vs leidt het tot een enorme groei van het thuisonderwijs dat gaat daar al om 1 5 miljoen kinderen
4705437 want dyslexie om maar iets te noemen is iets anders dan hoogbegaafdheid en dat vergt dus een ander soort zorg
4705438 de pluriformiteit van het onderwijs die is er helemaal niet een beetje liberalisering zou best wenselijk zijn
4705439 daar werken we nu hard aan maar het is absoluut niet zo dat dit soort scholen nodig is omdat er niet meer genoeg goede scholen in nederland zouden zijn integendeel driekwart van de scholen in nederland is gewoon goed zeker in bussum waar het initiatief start
4705440 juist op de basisschoolleeftijd is het belangrijk dat leerlingen ervaringen opdoen met kinderen uit allerlei groeperingen uit de samenleving
4705441 ik wil met dit initiatief ook een signaal geven aan de overheid dat het onderwijs anders kan
4705442 als je een reguliere school wilt starten moet je in het aanbod van de gemeente passen
4705443 daarnaast heb je een minimum aantal kinderen nodig om een school te stichten en dan wordt zon school en de klassen dus weer te groot die bureaucratische weg wilde ik niet nog een keer bewandelen
4705444 het is eigenlijk een variant op politieke stromingen als de pvda niet links genoeg is zal de sp groeien

4705448 i can understand how some people can live just one paycheck from disaster it really struck a chord with me
4705449 some of them cried a little bit just big smiles all over the room
4705450 the response has just been overwhelming beyond anything i could have foreseen or imagined
4705451 to say that were appreciative doesnt even begin to describe the thankfulness we feel or the joy the women expressed when they were told they could stay in their home
4705452 i looked around my family room and my own yard reminding me of my many comforts and blessings
4705453 still you clearly need what little we can give more than we do
4705454 no matter what happens to the shelter please tell the women that they have made it this far they will survive all future obstacles even if it does not feel that way right now
4705455 the hard part about being a bartender is figuring out who is drunk and who is just stupid
4705456 to determine the feasibility of changing all current fleets of trucks buses forklifts and heavy equipment to run on natural gas
4705457 our focus is to keep it safe and help these guys have a good time
4705458 team blue rally debut 2 and its awesome both things are in one room
4705459 its very scary both of us have studied in gwalior and the very thought of coming face to face with a member of this gang is alarming the local villagers have told us that the gadaria gang are quite active here
4705460 of the 257 deliveries we have conducted so far we have not had a single maternal death
4705461 we have had three cases of stillborn babies one case was of a mother running continuous high grade fever giving birth to seven month old twins fortunately the mother survived
4705462 this is the tip of the iceberg we believe many more women have died from childbirth but their deaths go unreported
4705463 the majority of deaths take place because of haemorrhage severe anaemia eclampsia malaria and sepsis
4705464 i rushed her to the district hospital in shivpuri the doctor there informed me she needed to be taken to gwalior i took her to gwalior medical college but she died soon after being admitted there
4705465 i borrowed rs 15 000 for her treatment ill sell my land if i cannot repay the loan
4705466 the lack of integration between the tb programme and the general healthcare system is the main reason why the programme has not attained its goals the phc health staff do not support the tb programme because it does not offer cash incentives these vertical programmes are creating distortions and there is no collaboration in the implementation of programmes
4705467 the doctors were completely callous veeja died within five minutes of being given an injection
4705468 most maternal deaths could be prevented if women had access to appropriate healthcare during pregnancy childbirth and immediately after delivery when a mother dies during pregnancy the family suffers a further increase in poverty
4705469 one of the key methods to improve maternal survival would be to review all maternal deaths at the community level
4705470 they are avoiding the issue and tell us to try solving the problem locally
4705471 over 200 000 families have been devastated by these deaths which have left 350 000 kids orphaned another 600 000 women have been left disabled because of pregnancy related disorders
4705472 we have not been able to stem this tide of maternal deaths despite having 20 000 obstetricians 5 lakh trained doctors and 25 lakh nurses and midwives
4705473 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4705474 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4705475 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4705476 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4705477 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4705478 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4705479 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4705480 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4705481 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4705482 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4705483 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4705484 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4705485 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4705486 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4705487 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4705488 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4705489 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4705490 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4705491 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4705492 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4705493 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4705494 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4705495 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4705496 e vil wyatt for a freez 2 05 ok homa sooners and refinance
4705497 we dont want the community to be making a judgment on which poles we can and cant use
4705498 but you have to be realistic hang it from something you own
4705499 there are a lot of good organizations with things to say
4705500 the town of bucksports economic development plan concludes that nhfs alamo theatre can play an important role in the new economic development of the business district by serving as a magnet for a wider group of people
4705501 we know that second hand smoke is a class a carcinogen that causes a wide variety of other illnesses particularly in children
4705502 childrens lungs ears and cardiovascular systems are much more sensitive to the toxic effects causing asthma ear infections and other problems
4705503 in cars you dont get the ventilation from september on everybody rolls their windows up until the following june you are in a box literally
4705504 we hope they will have another second hand effect of getting parents to not only stop smoking in the car but in other places around kids
4705505 in my mind it was like i wasnt stealing anything
4705506 i regret it very much it was so very wrong
4705507 you work hard you get ahead and you dont stop
4705508 there is a job to be done and it is a good job because it pays it doesnt really matter what my education was at home the opportunity is here and you take it and you do it and it will work out
4705509 with many immigrants there is this sense that they made this hard choice to leave their homelands and they are going to make it under any cost
4705510 i think theres a tendency to see the positive even under the most dire circumstances because so much is at stake theyve left family family members are counting on them and they want to make this work
4705511 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters
4705512 that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4705513 and im old enough to be able to handle it
4705514 i wouldnt have come back if i wasnt ready to come back
4705515 its what i do get out on the sidelines and get the boys fired up
4705516 im sorry for hurting my son i really never meant to do it
4705517 he shook him so hard that when i got into the room he was completely yellow

4705523 that hit so deep inside me i was suprised myself i may call you my whore my fuck slut my toy and use your mind and your body in any way that gives me pleasure but that is exclusive as your service to me your master not general degrading terms to deminish you
4705524 remember i will only give you what i want you to have and being satisfied with what she receives is a wonderful asset in a slave i think we will do a little training in that

4705568 the energy components and the commodity components are weighing on the averages as oil and gold fall the stronger dollar is a negative anchor on anything commodity related

4705574 we had this company in our changewave investing portfolio two years ago but we were a little early after it sold one of its businesses to general electric ge we decided to sell the stock and wait for the company to come up with its next big thing
4705575 well the next big thing was a solar technology that is twice as effective as existing technologies that lowers the cost of delivering electric power to 4 cents per kilowatt hour
4705576 and i want to tell you that ge is already on the prowl the company currently holds more than 600 000 shares and i wouldnt be surprised to see it buying more you want to own this stock now to stay ahead of ge because when it makes its move the shares are going to explode
4705577 the company also has a deal in the works with a major international manufacturing conglomerate to take its technology to china india and across asia in a big way

4705618 the croats who grew their mustaches out as a sign of team unity were the consensus pick to win gold in beijing and looked every bit the part in their first three games they beat italy serbia and germany by a combined 15 goals

4705654 ringling bros engages in these unlawful activities by routinely beating elephants to train them discipline them and keep them under control chaining them for long periods of time hitting them with sharp bull hooks breaking baby elephants with force to make them submissive and forcibly removing nursing baby elephants from their mothers before they are weaned with the use of ropes and chains
4705655 i think its immoral to have elephants traveling in every arena in the country with tuberculosis
4705656 about half of the elephants in each of the shows had tuberculosis and that the tuberculosis was an easily transmitted disease to individuals to human beings
4705657 i undertook a series of efforts to find out what pottker was doing and reported on the results of my work to mr feld
4705658 i was paid for this work by feld entertainment or its affiliates i prepared my reports in writing and presented them to mr feld in personal meetings
4705659 i was also asked to review reports from feld executive vice president richard froemming and his organizations based on their surveillance of and efforts to counter the activities of various animal rights groups
4705660 immediately upon learning about negative stories about ringling bros the animal issues department will put in place the rapid deployment force
4705661 the animal issues department will directly contact the editor news director armed with videos literature and other information the animal issues department head will demand a retraction or equal time and will work in concert with the grass roots campaign if the editor news director refuses the request legal will be informed to determine what recourses exist
4705662 all of a sudden my hair wasnt good enough my makeup wasnt good enough after 25 years of doing the news
4705663 leslie worked here for a number of years and did a fantastic job
4705664 we stand behind the stories as they aired there was a whole lot of attention given to their accuracy
4705665 to shovel this stuff into the public record and try to draw inferences from it or put it in out of context lends itself to all sorts of abuse the very kind of abuse that we contend took place on the san francisco television station last week
4705666 you can talk about the animal abuse but with a worldwide epidemic brewing id say the story is the tuberculosis
4705667 there are several alarming issues for epidemiologists drug resistance inability to diagnose if an elephant has been cured and disease spreading to handlers who work with them and to the public who attend circus performances
4705668 i dont know that anyone has asked the question im not sure anyone has ever tied it together
4705669 every elephant traveling with ringling has been exposed to tb and many of them have tb
4705670 to find a physician who would test the people in the circus to see if they had tuberculosis but who would destroy the records and not turn them in to the centers for disease control
4705671 shedding is when it can be passed to other elephants
4705672 what our trunk washes look for is a shedding of the bacteria
4705673 however there has been no proven case of tuberculosis bacterium being transmitted from elephants to humans
4705674 none of the elephants in our traveling unit have ever tested positive for tb
4705675 no none of our traveling elephants have ever tested positive for tb
4705676 moved from cec to blue unit just finished tb treatment
4705677 the court requested that the parties not discuss the specifics of the suit
4705678 investigation regarding allegations that ringling was using known tb infected animals in circus performances
4705679 government sanctioned abuse how the united states department of agriculture allows ringling bros circus to systematically mistreat elephants
4705680 although tuberculosis is an extremely contagious disease and ringlings elephants are publicly exhibited throughout the country including elephants that go in and out of both the breeding and retirement facilities the public has been kept completely in the dark about this investigation the agencys decision to override the conclusions of its own inspectors and investigators and the reasons this investigation was closed with no further action
4705681 this cozy relationship between the usda and ringling bros is going to be exposed during the trial
4705682 the united states department of agricultures final report of investigation concerning the incident concluded that benjamins trainers use of an ankus on benjamin created behavioral stress and trauma which precipitated in the physical harm and ultimate death of the animal on information and belief the routine beatings of benjamin were a contributing factor to his death
4705683 suddenly and without any signs of distress or struggle benjamin became unconscious and drowned
4705684 things are pretty much done on a case by case basis we try to work with a facility to come into compliance
4705685 from the videos i have seen so much of it is repackaged and old stuff that doesnt apply to us at all not at all
4705686 i have never seen a trainer use an ankus inappropriately
4705687 the circus is really good at creating the illusion of the happy performing elephants
4705688 so were asking the judge to enjoin them to stop them from using these practices
4705689 it is our considered opinion that elephants should not be used in circuses elephants in the wild roam over large areas and move considerable distances each day they are intelligent highly social animals with a complex system of communication elephants in circuses are bought and sold separated from companions confined chained and forced to stand for hours and frequently moved about in small compartments on trains or trucks they are required to perform behaviors never seen in nature
4705690 i see elephants and get to see them all day doing the most amazingly athletic things
4705691 you can separate the ones who want to do it from the ones who dont want to do it
4705692 good for the feld family that they support elephants from their births to their deaths
4705693 to have this issue aired in a public forum will be helpful for educating the public
4705694 in no way did i imagine the bulk of the evidence that would support our claims
4705695 theres no humane way to have a circus with elephants because it has to travel year round
4705696 if you take away the chains and the bull hooks an elephant isnt going to do anything
4705697 saw several of the other elephant handlers and trainers routinely beat the elephants including baby elephants and he saw then routinely hit and wound the elephants with sharp bull hooks
4705698 you see that with leslie griffith and its that kind of thing that they do all over the country
4705699 crossing the color line from rhythm amp blues to rock amp roll

4705710 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century

4705726 for many evangelical leaders rick warren is either a little too naive or a little too shrewd

4705747 fda has concluded that an adequate margin of safety exists for bpa at current levels of exposure from food contact uses

4705750 these groups no longer have any fear that by attacking police there will be some type of retribution
4705751 they commissioned us to san luis potosi to be trained when in reality they put us at the disposition of organized crime

4705772 just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4705773 hes kind of acknowledged as the individual that founded the specialty of healthcare law
4705774 hes been a real driver and force in the industry
4705775 thousands of healthcare cases and clients almost single handedly creating a legal specialty that is now so highly populated by busy lawyers he joked about having his own personal alumni association
4705776 when he started practicing in 1940 there was no specialty of healthcare law
4705777 it was lawyers who served on boards of directors of hospitals who did the work pro bono now for example the national health lawyers assn has grown to 10 000 members
4705778 hospitals were represented like churches it was pro bono work because of the amount of time i spent on it i established the pattern of being paid for it
4705779 you only had a relatively few hospitals back in those days back then you didnt have organized medical groups or integrated medical groups you didnt have medicare or medicaid
4705780 it was just a hell of a lot simpler back then now a hospital has every legal problem that a business has plus a medical staff which complicates things very much
4705781 without his leadership our members certainly would not have the same rich specialty in which to earn their living and contribute to society
4705782 healthcare is a cause at least it became a cause for me and thats the way most people in this industry feel its really been a great career
4705783 i am touched by the overwhelming support it is no longer just a by election it is a lot more than that
4705784 this is not just any by election it is about the next malaysian leader
4705785 permatang pauh voters have a heavy burden they are deciding the destiny of the country
4705786 over the course of five decades he was one of if not the greatest fiction editors in magazines
4705787 a man who cared greatly about stature and status in the world of fiction
4705788 he was interested in the standards of serious literature and he tried to in a commercial magazine impose upon its pages some of the lofty notions he had about the written word
4705789 he basically was from the beginning a champion of literary fiction
4705790 when arnold gingrich started esquire back in the 30s the magazine published some very good writers such as ernest hemingway and f scott fitzgerald but by the time rust arrived in 1957 i think it was publishing fiction that was nowhere near as good at least on a consistent basis as what rust was about to bring to the magazine
4705791 believed in fiction as i think the ultimate creative expression
4705792 i once saw him tell an editor in chief of the magazine that he could show him exactly why a story was superb
4705793 he really did believe a good short story was the ultimate feature of a magazine no matter what reader surveys showed
4705794 he thought that that was the most skillful thing that he did
4705795 being able to excerpt bits from novels so that theyd resemble short stories was the height in some ways of the magazine editors art
4705796 and told me if i would write good short stories he would publish them it was extremely encouraging to me esquire to me at the time was the place that you really wanted to publish fiction
4705797 really loved to read and his tastes were extremely wide
4705798 being a fiction editor for a publisher or a magazine is a very difficult job but rust never got jaded ever in his life about reading fiction ever ever to his last breath he saw the world through the optic of good fiction
4705799 were not seeing the thousands the hundreds who streamed through in the past
4705800 i dont see the justification to spend 60 million on an area thats no longer an important crossing

4705816 the fda alone simply lacks the ability to serve as the sole guarantor of drug safety
4705817 the fda would be stripped of an essential source of information that the agency has consistently relied on when making its regulatory decisions and the american public would be deprived of a vital deterrent against pharmaceutical company misconduct
4705818 the law in the devices case had a pre emption provision
4705819 congress has never put a pre emption provision in the food and drug act
4705820 fda considers and approves specific labeling for a drug and the drug manufacturer is generally barred from making unilateral changes to the fda approved labeling

4705824 we have tried that in the 1990s we dont want to go down that path again
4705825 what im not happy about is that russia has widened its zone of occupation and so far we are waiting for it to comply with the agreement

4705957 i stole some cocaine and mushrooms out of the family members stash it was kept in the wall behind the drywall nobody knew it was there but every weekend there was a lot of partying the family member was doing it all the time so we thought it was normal a babysitter we had at the time showed us how to smoke it
4705958 i was raised by my mom who was a hard worker and tried hard for us she wasnt always there but she was mostly there

4706037 i once cheated on my girlfriend after i saw on her cell phone that she had been text messaging with her ex
4706038 ever since i can remember i have always been attracted to women with large chests my ex girlfriend was great in a lot of ways but she was completely flat chested which did absolutely nothing to make me sexually attracted to her i tried to look past it but it was hard about two months into our relationship i was out with a bunch of friends at a sports bar and our incredibly hot and ample chested waitress was really hitting on me she gave me her number and asked me if i wanted me to meet her after her shift was over i agreed and ended up sleeping with her it was just a one night thing but it helped me realize i needed to end things with my girlfriend because i had to be with someone i was madly attracted to

4706041 i met my ex in a weight watchers meeting of all places
4706042 my ex and i used to live together and we fought all the time the constant tension made me miserable in contrast to my ex there was a girl at work who was easygoing friendly and fun one night we were both working late and ended up getting a drink together after we left one thing led to another and i ended up staying over at her place as bad as this may sound after that happened i felt free it was as if i finally had the courage to just end it with my ex already when i came home the next morning my ex went crazy but for the first time it didnt bother me because i knew what i was going to do i told her exactly what had happened and that id be moving out that week and i did i began seeing the girl from work and weve been together for about four months now

4706102 thats part of the gameplan my gameplan was to beat him with the strikes standing up because i knew on the ground he was very hard to submit
4706103 it was nothing when i came back in the corner i had a cut i think it was a knee i got cut with a knee to the face
4706104 when i came back to the corner to give my confidence my cornermen said oh its just a little scratch it didnt mess me up at all
4706105 to break my opponent down and to make him accept my dominance
4706106 it is very difficult to say at this point whether after the olympics chinese society will become more open
4706107 there is always back and forth struggles between the authorities and the grass roots and citizens
4706108 theres still a lot of tension and the grass roots need to push their work forward
4706109 it has played a great role whether its about banning disposable chopsticks or sorting trash everyone at the mention of the olympics said they should do a better job
4706110 but since the olympics is already here the government had no choice but to move the agenda ahead
4706111 still has a long ways to go in engaging with civil society as true partners
4706112 i feel that for the disabled in china it cannot be called discrimination but unequal opportunities but for now it is improving and the pace will pick up because of the paralympics especially in job employment

4706114 ideologies may be power structures that manipulate human action but they are also ideational systems that enable us to choose to become what we want to become
4706115 the social imaginary is that common understanding which makes possible common practices and a widely shared sense of legitimacy
4706116 comprehensive belief systems composed of patterned ideas and claims to truth codified by social elites these beliefs are embraced by significant groups in society
4706117 an ideology attempts to end the inevitable contention over concepts by decontesting them by removing their meanings from contest
4706118 charles taylor argues that the social imaginary is neither a theory nor an ideology but an implicit

4706133 the us is falling behind in the war against aids
4706134 harm is associated in every aspect of our lives and so is the practice of harm reduction
4706135 why is it that we practice harm reduction instead of absolute abstinence in our everyday life but push absolute abstinence for injection drug users
4706136 so why wont the feds lift the ban on funding for needle exchange programs you tell me

4706145 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4706146 to begin to repair its relations with the united states and europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors
4706147 right now our focus is on the immediate issue of the russian troops withdrawing that there be a cessation of violence
4706148 and that is where our focus will remain in this immediate time period
4706149 and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying arise go down to meet ahab king of israel which is in samaria behold he is in the vineyard of naboth whither he is gone down to possess it and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord hast thou killed and also taken possession and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord in the place where dogs licked the blood of naboth shall dogs lick thy blood even thine and ahab said to elijah hast thou found me o mine enemy and he answered i have found thee because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the lord behold i will bring evil upon thee and will take away thy posterity and will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in israel and will make thine house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger and made israel to sin and of jezebel also spake the lord saying the dogs shall eat jezebel by the wall of jezreel him that dieth of ahab in the city the dogs shall eat and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat but there was none like unto ahab which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the lord whom jezebel his wife stirred up

4706180 dna evidence and photo evidence to be presented that a bigfoot body found
4706181 vital statistics on the bigfoot body the creature is seven feet seven inches tall the creature looks like it is part human and part ape like it is male it has reddish hair and blackish grey eyes it has two arms and two legs and five fingers on each hand and five toes on each foot the feet are flat and similar to human feet its footprint is 16 3 4s inches long and 5 3 4s inches wide at the heel from the palm of the hand to the tip of the middle finger its hands are 11 3 4s inches long and 6 1 4 inches wide the creatures walk upright several of them were sighted on the same day that the body was found the teeth are more human like than ape like
4706182 one of the dna segments from the tissue sample was 100 human about 500 base pairs the other dna segment was an apparent mix of dna sequence however the dna sequence interpreted by the sequencing computer algorithm indicates at least a 96 match do didelphis virginians a possum
4706183 it was june 10 2008 around 4 pm we were hiking through the woods in northern georgia and we stumbled upon the body the first thing that we saw was the feet and we went over and looked at the body in shock we said to each other we have to get this out of the woods so matt stayed behind and i went and got a tow truck and three more friends to help us i brought them back to the woods pulled the tow truck on the side the road and we all walked in the woods and wrapped the creatures body in a tarp and pulled it back to the tow truck we let the bed down and winched it on and we took off we went back to the house and put the body in a beef freezer a couple of days later the beef freezer failed we bought another beef freezer and put it in there it wouldnt freeze it was a frost free beef freezer so we had to go buy another deep freezer and this one froze the body solid in ice the photograph that shows the creature laying in what appears to be dark water when did the ice thaw what happened that was when the second one failed to freeze ok so that photograph was taken back in june 2008 late june so that was about two weeks after you found the body and was it near a creek correct it was near a creek between two trees was there any sign of struggle along the creek to indicate what might have happened to the creature was it attacked do you have any speculation i have no idea we really didnt look to be honest our main goal was just to get the body out of the woods when you were trying to gather the body up in the tarp can you describe what you felt with your own hands and saw with your own eyes and smelled with your nose it smelled like a dead animal the creature is intimidating to look at even dead also there were three other live bigfoots flanking us on each side all the way to the trail once we hit the trail they stopped following us when you were gathering the body up in the tarp you realized that there were other bigfoot around yes there were three of them ranging from 20 to 50 feet away they were looking at us they were not scared of us at first we were terrified of them and then we knew they were not going to harm us i could not tell the sex of the live ones i took a couple of pictures and live shots there were three creatures and i could not tell if one was male and one was female and at that point i didnt care laughs are you in the process of putting the large dead body in the tarp when you see the other three bigfoot yes what was the first thing you noticed were they walking towards you they were staring at us they werent trying to attack us we just felt like they were mourning the dead one in sadness exactly were they standing motionless in some of my pictures they are motionless in other pictures they were walking as we were dragging the body wrapped in the tarp so the five of you are pulling the tarp with the large dead animal through the forest to go out to the wench are the other three bigfoot directly behind you where are they they are all around walking in an arc around you a half circle basically yes which one was closest to you they all looked alike to me two of them looked to be the same size and the third one looked a little smaller but the largest two got the closest and the closest was about 20 feet from you yes at that 20 feet could you see the eyes clearly yes what were you seeing black eyes there was a report that the eyes of the dead one look grey and black the only reason the eyes of the dead one look grey is because its dead it isnt as if it has a grey iris no now when we first found it back on june 10 it didnt look that way but now it does im sure decomposition has been a factor in this because of the way we had to freeze it and it unfroze and we refroze and it unfroze and things like that what were the eyes like when you first found it on june 10 yes they were open as if whatever happened the creature died with its eyes open im only telling you what i saw i dont have any speculation about what happened the eyes of the live ones were open and i remember them blinking like humans blink did you find the dead one on its back or stomach on the back you could see the feet first yes were the bottoms and tops of the feet hairless the bottom has no hair the top has hair was that the same with the hands the hands dont have hair at all did it have fingernails as we would recognize on a human i didnt inspect it the teeth in the close up of the head they were so even and white we released pictures of the head and teeth today at the press conference august 15 2008 and the head i guess would be a cone shaped head protruding upward yes the mouth and teeth did you look at them closely before you wrapped the creature in the tarp no because we were trying to do it quickly before it got dark i didnt inspect the body that good i still havent inspected the body that good but in the photograph you cant see any incisor teeth they are very even like animals that eat plants and not meat correct at the press conference there was a reference that the bigfoot is definitely male what does that mean exactly he has huge genitals like a male homo sapiens only larger yes but super larger im not going to measure the creatures balls i didnt see any penis and everybody saw this and can confirm what im saying rick dyer matthew whitton and the three friends who helped haul the heavy creature in the tarp could you see sex organs on any of the other three no i could not i wasnt paying attention to that i was trying to get the hell out of there what did the hair feel like the hair felt silky smooth it basically felt like a womans hair
4706184 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and shut it off
4706185 once you do your first one you become part of an elite class as a triathlete
4706186 packers tickets were hard to come by but the toughest ticket for me was the preseason
4706187 i would have all my friends come out and family come for the preseason then during the regular season i was just giving my tickets away to teammates it was a very important time very stressful time
4706188 our thing weve been experimenting and looking is to feel enough confidence in charlies ability to do the job that i can use seneca in other things
4706189 it was cool playing with those people and being right next to them
4706190 you look around sometimes you catch yourself because youre watching them but you just focus on what youre doing
4706191 i wasnt really nervous i just went out and played im only 17 no one expected me to do anything there was no pressure
4706192 the deployment of new antimissile forces in europe has as its aim the russian federation
4706193 the moment has been chosen well and therefore any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work
4706194 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia when a great power invaded a small neighbor and overthrew its government
4706195 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely that the ossetians and the abkhazians will be able to live in one state together with the georgians
4706196 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4706197 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4706198 poland by deploying the interceptors is exposing itself to a strike 100
4706199 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them

4706206 because of the nature of the business theres a lot of travel involved odd hours thereve been times we all live under the same roof but we havent seen each other for days on end
4706207 its wonderful to get an opportunity to spend six weeks on the road with the family i dont think weve spent this amount of time and this quality of time for over 10 years together
4706208 i think it speaks wonderfully and gloriously for the indian film industry
4706209 its very heartening to know that indian films are viewed in all these places and its wonderful to know that you reach out to so many people and they appreciate your work
4706210 the left hand trait is really impressive for how fluid secure and precise it is
4706211 despite all the perplexity that it may cause also regarding the lack of information on its provenance the work is at least for now the most important find since the identification of the lady with an ermine
4706212 there were only very few artists of that caliber then
4706213 there are collectors who keep these works of art in bank vaults but it is likely that well find others
4706214 we know of artworks that have been documented and that we havent found yet
4706215 i had to take my goggles off to see the 1 next to my name
4706216 when i took that extra half stroke i thought id lost the race
4706217 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer finished second
4706218 im sure people will be bringing this up for years saying you won that race
4706219 it was a real honor to race michael phelps and being in that situation where all eyes were on me
4706220 is when someone says you cant do something it shows you anything is possible
4706221 packers tickets were hard to come by but the toughest ticket for me was the preseason
4706222 i would have all my friends come out and family come for the preseason then during the regular season i was just giving my tickets away to teammates it was a very important time very stressful time
4706223 our thing weve been experimenting and looking is to feel enough confidence in charlies ability to do the job that i can use seneca in other things
4706224 i didnt sleep a lot i was just lying in bed waiting for my race i hope to go quicker tomorrow
4706225 my swim was good tomorrow is another race i know im in contention but so is everybody else its all close out there
4706226 i wish we could get robots involved instead of people
4706227 croatia right now is playing their best water polo and for us to beat them and control this game today shows that were definitely in contention for a gold medal
4706228 well celebrate for five minutes then get ourselves ready for monday
4706229 standing next to the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4706230 every time i leave the 2 mile radius of where i live people are coming up to me
4706231 i dont want to be finished after the olympic games i would love to compete as long as my body will let me
4706232 a lot of people are in it for the money and sponsors but thats never been my goal you know to get so many sponsors or to earn this much money thats just something extra
4706233 theres maybe one or two women gymnasts that have been able to capitalise on their olympic experience and make a long term career out of and thats it
4706234 the mental health and substance abuse systems are separately funded and separately regulated and individuals with needs that cut across more than one system are difficult to treat
4706235 set it up as though anyone can only have one disorder
4706236 were in very bad straits right now and im scared to death
4706237 this is one example that has come to light but the other examples are going to pop up soon all over baltimore county
4706238 once the renovations are done on these places the rent has to go up
4706239 had a huge role in the transaction of the properties
4706240 people cant live in them when these renovations are being done
4706241 they all need new roofs all new windows new drainage tiles in the basements
4706242 when i moved in the floor in the bathroom was crashing into my basement
4706243 ive got mold in my house and my roof has been leaking since i lived here
4706244 i always joke that ive got a rooftop swimming pool
4706245 had no idea that these new owners were going to do what they did
4706246 they didnt fix nothing but they never raised your rent
4706247 every swim is amazing to me no matter who won first or last
4706248 what shes had to experience to undergo with all of those surgeries she still has such a great attitude
4706249 its been one thing after another for about 14 years now
4706250 nothing is guaranteed except that were going to the do best we can for her
4706251 she was excited about the water from the day she stepped in it
4706252 she literally cannot wait to get to the pool every day
4706253 there were times when she had no reason to be there too sick or something but there she was she has that special passion that you dont always see to a certain extent if she had all the physical attributes of michael shed be another michael phelps
4706254 additional names of some people we might want to talk to that we havent talked to
4706255 our goal is to give family members the answers and when one of them dies before you do that its certainly upsetting but it doesnt deter us from continuing to pursue the case
4706256 ive gone from two workers at the waverly market to five
4706257 ive gone from three freezers to four ive gone from one to two trucks
4706258 i can tell all our new customers by all the questions they asked
4706259 they asked about how our animals are housed they asked about hormones and antibiotics they asked where our feed comes from
4706260 for years the maryland department of agriculture labored in the wilderness trying to promote our local produce all of a sudden its red hot
4706261 all of the indicators say there is something going on in the minds of consumers saying we want local
4706262 vendors tell me they are up 25 percent from a year ago some are up 50 percent
4706263 my egg and chicken customers like the story behind the product
4706264 they want that local product and they are willing to pay for it there is a real interest in and appreciation of the egg
4706265 the only reason i havent been selling out earlier is that ive been bringing so much more
4706266 i think people are staying closer to home this summer and that that they are scared by all the produce shipped in over great distances
4706267 they look at a tomato and know it was just picked off a vine and that it was not gassed to make it appear red
4706268 i simply feel very comfortable shopping here because everything is fresh
4706269 daryl are you praying for summer or were you just too lazy to take your ironing out
4706270 we have not ruled out selling our tickets even though we would hate to do it
4706271 but right now we havent been satisfied with the bids weve received or the companies were dealing with
4706272 at one time we counted them up and we were involved with 40 organizations but we had a wonderful time
4706273 my dream was to play football in college and after i got polio i knew that wasnt going to happen so i got involved in other things
4706274 by the mid 1980s my doctors told me that i ought to get out of my business which i sold in 1986 and all other outside activities
4706275 we used to call it the tiltin hilton because the beams had rotted and it tilted
4706276 thats where the kids and grandkids stay when they come for a visit we live on the first floor
4706277 frank built a lovely brick walk sitting in his scooter and takes care of the yardwork
4706278 i do the planting and he does the weeding and watering its a good partnership
4706279 owning an internet caf is not a good business and this is most felt during the summer when many people leave for holidays
4706280 there are hardly any internet users coming to my shop in the day normally customers only turn up at around 5 00pm
4706281 i have more customers on thursdays and fridays some of them stay here for 12 to 15 hours straight
4706282 whenever i talk to my family i forget looking at the watch many times i spend at least five hours every friday just speaking to them
4706283 if there is pressure or stigma if you have mental health problems a drug addiction or live in poverty all of those things are likely to cause serious emotional problems later whether you had an abortion or a regular delivery
4706284 no credible evidence that a single elective abortion of an unwanted pregnancy in and of itself causes mental health problems for adult women
4706285 they do suffer from guilt i have seen many many cases of people who suffer clinical depression
4706286 ive talked to people that have attempted suicide in the past and they do say its because of the pain they have suffered because of abortion
4706287 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
4706288 strong and complex feelings before and after a major life decision including the decision to choose an abortion or to carry a pregnancy to term are a natural part of life
4706289 i dont know if i would make much of a one year comparison
4706290 this is a disease where theres a tremendous amount of vaguery
4706291 we need several years of declining numbers to say somethings up
4706292 less than half the people who get lyme get the bulls eye rash we havent even begun to talk about the other infections people are getting like babesiosis ehrlichiosis bartonella tularemia anaplasmosis all things ticks are co infected with and are not being tested for
4706293 an average of 24 percent of hip fracture patients age 50 and over die within a year of the fracture
4706294 they may have been borderline able to walk before the fracture then this really sets them back
4706295 theres no credible evidence that whats in airborne can prevent colds or protect you from a germy environment
4706296 airborne is basically an overpriced run of the mill vitamin pill thats been cleverly but deceptively marketed

4706312 im less interested in technology than i am in change
4706313 i think change for the sake of change is good
4706314 from day one my partner and i have been thinking whats coming next
4706315 we owned the rights to sell their music digitally but there was no place to sell it we had to wait for the market to mature
4706316 we supply music to just about every isp like itunes napster zune every place that digital music is sold at retail were dealing with most of the mobiles
4706317 i think music will come to people in a way that feels like a free way
4706318 they could find no way to continue consumption and derive revenue so they started this ridiculous sue your audience stuff your customers the fans theyre the lifeblood of the industry i wont call it piracy i wont say it was stolen i will say it was appropriated
4706319 but i think you are going to find that a lot of music sells more if you give it away free first
4706320 the business was always controlled by a small group of people
4706321 how things were done was a secret how you made records and how you manufactured them and once you got them how are you going to get them to the people
4706322 the internet took control away the one element the industry could always control was distribution
4706323 the brand is the artist as in the old days you have to find a way to speak to the audience with digital there is the opportunity to identify what people want and give it to them instead of the broad spectrum we had to attack with radio in the old days now you can get down to reach that audience without having to worry about the whole country
4706324 i guess the difference is the record companies look at this as the end of something i see the beginning of something i dont see the end of anything
4706325 its an opportunity for more greatness from the industry that has been so good to me all my life plus im still looking for that next hit
4706326 i just know if you want to go the other way go ahead

4706330 elements of the program violated al jazeeras code of ethics
4706331 it has to go down as one of the strangest market days ever
4706332 perhaps some people did not come to the town because of the fire and some people came because of it its the talk of the town
4706333 im sure there will be lots of people thinking we can see the market and the remains of the kings hotel as well but what a fabulous market it is there are some amazing stalls
4706334 we hope lots more people will come to the town centre over the weekend and monday
4706335 the first day of the summer market spectacular has been absolutely wonderful
4706336 obviously the fire at the kings head could have really put a dampener on things but it hasnt
4706337 the town has been busy all day the stalls have been busy the tea dance was packed there were lots of children enjoying the entertainment
4706338 we woke up this morning and my mum rang me up to say it was on fire
4706339 we thought she was joking at first but we went down and saw it in flames
4706340 we have been running round all day but we have got everything more or less sorted now
4706341 we had to try to find a new venue straightaway because we were going to stay there overnight and so were some of our guests
4706342 when mark told me i drove straight down to the town centre because i didnt think it would be that bad
4706343 but i saw the flames and i was in tears i got back home and didnt know what to do
4706344 we couldnt get hold of the staff at first and didnt know what to do we then saw the staff and started to make other plans
4706345 we are more than happy to step in and help this couple out by hosting their reception
4706346 gordon was asleep so i asked one of the other guests to tell the staff downstairs we could not get out
4706347 i checked one of the fire escapes but there was smoke everywhere if we had tried to get out there we would have choked
4706348 i shouted out the window to the fire brigade to ask if we could use the lift but i dont think they could hear us
4706349 the two men who helped us were excellent i dread to think what could have happened if they had not been there
4706350 i was in bed reading when i heard the alarm i went outside into the corridor and lots of people were running around in a panic
4706351 the hotels assistant manager and his assistant then came running up they got us into the lift and outside into the street
4706352 they did a marvellous job i did get their names but i have forgotten them because ive been a bit shaken up we are so grateful to them
4706353 there were people from italy japan and india who also lost their passports
4706354 we had to cancel the tour so everybody could get things sorted out i was watching tv with my sister when the alarm went off
4706355 i made sure my mother was okay and we all went out into the street straight away
4706356 it was chaos but everyone involved in the recovery operation was great
4706357 i like the place so im sure we will be back
4706358 its our hope that releasing the audio to the public we can come closer to finding mr walis killer
4706359 id be interested in what the public thinks and whether they recognize the suspects voice
4706360 were using all these great new tools at our hands
4706361 all issues can be resolved only through dialogue and peaceful means
4706362 the purpose driven life what on earth am i here for
4706363 this is absolutely a changing of the guard and it suggests that the new guard of the evangelical movement is able to generate the attention and focus of both parties
4706364 faith in the halls of power how evangelicals joined the american elite
4706365 helping the church regain credibility and encouraging our society to return to civility
4706366 america has a choice its not between a stud and a dud this year
4706367 both of these men care about america my job is to let them share their views
4706368 hes a guy whose message has met the right moment
4706369 for many evangelical leaders rick warren is either a little too naive or a little too shrewd
4706370 he is threatening to water down the essential message of evangelical christianity
4706371 jesus told us to love our neighbor even if they dont agree with you
4706372 has that gift of being able to popularize ideas that are in some ways commonplace
4706373 just a regular guy who may be americas most influential pastor

4706386 what will happen to me if im hiv positive oh god take care of us
4706387 theres so much hiv hopefully there will be a cure
4706388 i realize that the problems are huge and daunting but i dont believe theres anything that cant be fixed as long as everyone is pulling in the same direction
4706389 i love challenges i love complex issues and problems and this certainly met all that
4706390 i wanted to know that i would have the ability to call the shots
4706391 basically said youre the publisher and ceo its yours to run and that was pretty much it
4706392 one of the questions i asked sam was are you going to keep this
4706393 no intention of changing the editor of the los angeles times
4706394 hell meet you once and he wont forget your name he wont forget what you do and hell care about all of that
4706395 its a very refreshing way for a senior leader to be
4706396 the market conditions were the driving force behind it not happening
4706397 those guys are very bright guys if they couldnt get it done im not sure who couldve
4706398 patients are admitted to the medical unit with flimsy medical diagnosis and often have psychiatric needs that are not addressed
4706399 over four years ago dhs made certain allegations about the hospitals admissions policies the city of angels immediately responded to the few isolated deficiencies to the full satisfaction of dhs two subsequent dhs inspections within the year found no further such problems
4706400 is currently undertaking an investigation at city of angels as such we are not commenting further at this time
4706401 the japanese high courts own translation says conspiracy they know the difference between conspiracy and plotting
4706402 the whole thing is much ado about nothing miura was already acquitted thats the end of it
4706403 there is no law of conspiracy in japan a double jeopardy theory would not pass muster
4706404 recognize meat for what it really is the antibiotic and pesticide laden corpse of a tortured animal
4706405 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4706406 its definitely going to be the most exciting final weve had in a very long time in the mens 100
4706407 nastia is obviously benefiting from her success so far and stands to benefit even more from the olympics
4706408 but her relevancy for most mainstream sports fans disappears in about three weeks its not to say there wont be opportunity its just limited opportunity limited but still lucrative
4706409 both of these kids have an appeal way beyond what some of the past figure skaters had in the way of vibrant personalities
4706410 the marketing potential for both is relatively untapped and unlimited
4706411 hes not going to just fall into a black hole
4706412 i think after the games youll see him have sustainability and dont forget hell be competing in london in 2012
4706413 you dont have to create as much as you had to earlier in the year
4706414 we have to wait for that part of the lineup to come up again
4706415 put on gods armor so as to be able to resist the devils tactics
4706416 with truth buckled around my waist and integrity for a breastplate
4706417 salvation from god to be my helmet and receive the word of god from the spirit to use as a sword
4706418 whoa now i already gave you a macbook pro what more do you want
4706419 therefore since we have been justified through faith we have peace with god through jesus christ
4706420 to have a direct experience verifiable knowledge that can be measured and or demonstrated as real
4706421 i have faith the sun will rise tomorrow this faith is rational because there is evidence the sun has risen every day for as long as humans have been around to see it and it is logical to conclude the sun will rise tomorrow as well
4706422 our intellect was made for the purpose of seeing god
4706423 a thing is to have direct experience verifiable knowledge that can be measured and or demonstrated as real
4706424 evidence acquired through direct observation preferably under controlled circumstances with results reported in well defined units of measure empirical evidence is therefore provisional as any other observation might have been different
4706425 information that has been derived through direct observation experiments or experience
4706426 this is just like behind the music but no one cares
4706427 it took us four or five days to realize that from then on the history of civilization could be divided into before the launch and after
4706428 ok its time for everyone to band together get over our petty bickering and realize that the only way were going to make it in this universe is to realize that were all humans our similarities outweigh our differences so completely that we might as well be the same so lets just all get along okay
4706429 we cant let the russians be better than we are
4706430 a new species has awoken in our galaxy let us go see what they are like

4706435 i am thrilled to have an accomplished executive and legislator join our team
4706436 jason is the realization of nbjcs vision of a society where we all live and serve openly as americans
4706437 forward to working with everyone at nbjc and within the civil rights and lgbt communities ever since nbjc counseled me on my coming out i have wanted to give back to the african american lgbt community we will together advance nbjcs membership programming and civil rights agenda as well as continue to brand the organization as the national leader on these issues
4706438 what i love about jeremy gilley and the peace one day campaign is that the whole thing was started by just one individual who is trying to make a difference despite the odds we all have so much potential but we dont tend to realize it so we take it for granted the work of peace one day encourages and inspires people to think about what we can all do both at individual and collective levels there are better and alternative means to conflict resolution than killing and maiming the enemy political leaders and power brokers have too much invested in the industry of war rather than implementing peaceful solutions what is life without peace peace is for the highest good and as a global community it is one of the things we need to value above everything
4706439 we now have a remarkable chance to each do our part to commit to peaceful activities on peace day and this day has been proven to save lives
4706440 i am excited to be in new york to celebrate this important day with internationally acclaimed singers like annie lennox bryan adams and natasha bedingfield
4706441 it is a forward looking platform in so many areas including those relating to lgbt people the task force action fund is certainly pleased to see that in the opening paragraph of the section titled a more perfect union for the first time the platform explicitly calls for an end to discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity this demonstrates the success and unprecedented partnership between lgbt advocates and courageous public leaders including representative baldwin in educating the public and policymakers on the need for fully inclusive anti discrimination protections
4706442 the 2008 platform reiterates and strengthens past support for legislation that would protect our community including calls for the passage of hate crimes and comprehensive employment discrimination legislation and the repeal of the discriminatory dont ask dont tell policy in our nations military the platform also supports the full inclusion of same sex couples and their families with equal rights benefits and responsibilities for the first time the platform opposes the discriminatory defense of marriage act which bars federal recognition of even those same sex couples legally married under state law the platform also supports other issues of importance for glbt and all americans including a call for a national strategy to combat hiv aids support for fair and impartial judges not driven by ideology and requirements that faith based programs not use federal dollars to discriminate
4706443 this platform stands in stark contrast to a republican party which continues to marginalize millions of americans from full inclusion in public life just because of who they are or the person they love
4706444 the 2008 democratic national platform will be a guiding document for policy and legislation that embodies the values of our party these advancements in our partys binding document are thanks to the work and input of lgbt delegates senator barack obama and his campaign lgbt advocates and stonewall democrats across the country
4706445 the most compelling evidence of all for the effectiveness of safe sex is the simple fact that when safe sex was taken on by men who have sex with men msm the escalation in infection rates was pegged back
4706446 this made it immediately clear that the risk of hiv infection was not associated with male to male sex per se rather it was associated with unsafe male to male sex
4706447 many of the samples in studies cited by the red cross are very small recruited from men at high risk and explicitly exclude men who practise safe sex in monogamous relationships they are not representative of all men who have sex with men
4706448 in those whose behaviour is exclusively heterosexual safe sex practices are less common if there was an outbreak of hiv amongst heterosexuals in australia it would clearly spread more rapidly than it would in the gay community
4706449 there is no evidence anywhere that people become gay by choice
4706450 the deferral of men who have sex with men is based on who they are rather than what they have recently done and can be likened to deferral on the grounds of being jewish or indigenous
4706451 you never should feel too confident you just need to be there like its a new experience for you just try to be there 100 just try your best anybody can win
4706452 there are so many good players out here i like to play in the last group i like to play on sunday to give myself a chance to win
4706453 this has been a good year so far and hopefully we can continue with a win
4706454 it was important to make a few birdies to put my name up there and im glad i am where i like to be and everything went well
4706455 theyre not handing out the trophy after the first day and theyre not handing it out after the second day
4706456 lorena is obviously the no 1 player in the world shes a great player yeah im a couple of shots back and i need to stick to my game plan i cant try to beat lorena
4706457 ten more good years is a one of a kind documentary that challenges all of us to rethink the way we perceive aging
4706458 i hope that with the release of the dvd everyone will have an opportunity to discover the amazing elders who share their stories in the film im sure that viewers whether straight or gay will find the film both enlightening and inspiring and for anyone working with or around older adults the film will provide an excellent educational tool
4706459 have to be a lot of progress made by others
4706460 the young guys and new guys have been a little slower picking up our schemes and stuff but thats to be expected
4706461 we have brandon williams we have sandy we have daniel we have mckinner thats too many guys that are being productive stacked at one position
4706462 so as early as tomorrow i might go ahead and move sandy over there to that left side
4706463 the biggest thing ive seen in him is it looks like hes made progress on playing the run
4706464 hes always been a very good pass rusher for us sometimes hed do good last year playing run sometimes he didnt i expect to see much more consistency from against the run than a year ago
4706465 from day one to day 13 hes made improvement each day but he had a long ways to go when he came in hes going to need the full extent of this fall camp and even when we start games hes still going to be learning
4706466 i dont yell im happy my blood pressures down im bragging on you good work julius
4706467 its something different that defenses have to respect when im back there
4706468 we did kind of a similar read play when i was in high school so im kind of familiar with it and coach leach knew that when he called me this summer and kind of wanted to start running it
4706469 we worked on it this summer kind of getting my eyes back to reading the defense and stuff like that
4706470 i think well be successful at it if we continue to execute and not mess up the snap
4706471 we ran that 15 times a game it was a good play for us
4706472 je suis vice champion olympique on est deux fran ais sur le podium dans une discipline qui tait domin e par des fous furieux
4706473 je suis tr s heureux j tais un peu nerveux avant la course mais je pense avoir nag la meilleure course de ma carri re
4706474 cest un truc de malade jai vu mes jambes trembler et apr s je nai pens quau start
4706475 javais peur de penser tout sauf au 50m avant je me faisais des petits films l je ne lai pas fait
4706476 cette fois ce n tait pas une seule jambe c tait les deux
4706477 c tait une superbe course jai sorti mon meilleur temps cest bien avec toute cette fatigue li e l motion
4706478 he continues to throw great bullpen sessions between starts he warms up good for his starts then he gets in the game and loses the sink on the ball he throws it about thigh high
4706479 were all wanting him to turn it around his history says he gets a lot of ground balls we just have to believe its going to start happening
4706480 his story all year has been his inability to get that big ground ball pitch to get out of the big inning he seems to have hes very frustrated and rightly so he has the ability its just not coming out
4706481 i dont know if thats the solution or not i guess it would be a possibility but we havent discussed that i feel for the guy i know how hard he works and how badly he wants to do it especially today against his old team
4706482 it would have been perfect i would have gotten to go to a place thats contending and its in my own backyard
4706483 i have to go out and give my team a chance to win no matter who im pitching for im disappointed but if i fall on my face the last six weeks of the season i wont be in anyones plans for next year the mariners or someone trying to trade for me
4706484 in general on the issue of dumping salaries our goal here is to get better
4706485 even back to the trade deadline and moving forward we want to get players back that will make us better now and in the future money can give you flexibility but theres no guarantee you can turn that flexibility into anything
4706486 ive said all along with players under our control that people are assuming we want to move wed like to get value back for them we want to get the best deal we can get for them now or later other deals may come along and develop into something larger and even involve us eating some money to get players that make us better
4706487 i really was kind of arguing blindly because i couldnt see if he caught the ball or not to tell you the truth
4706488 you argue a point enough theyre not going to continue to listen

4706490 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4706491 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4706492 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4706493 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4706494 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4706495 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4706496 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4706497 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4706498 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4706499 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4706500 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4706501 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4706502 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4706503 i dont think there is anybody on our team you could ask who we are playing and they wouldnt know
4706504 they are not like the rest of the pac 10 their schemes are different so its more of an advantage to have a longer time to get ready for them than three days
4706505 if you say youre playing a division ii team that doesnt bring the same sharpness to your team they think they cannot be on spot and win the game here if you are not on spot you are not going to like the results i like that i think it brings a hum to your coaches and elevates us and lets us know where we are right away good or bad you are going to be fact finding you are going to find some information
4706506 the high you are going to get for beating them is tremendously high
4706507 if you dont win its a big low but youve still got to recover and play the next week its not a one game season
4706508 me having never beaten them since ive been here and the fact that i dont like them i think has inspired me i have put a lot of time in the offensive line has worked together a lot we want to go in there and dominate them because i am tired of losing to them we are all tired of losing to them
4706509 saat itu kejadiannya masih beristri bambang dengan halimah agustina kamil mungkin karena itu kali yang membedakan semuanya

4706511 bauer who followed his stablemate through could not match his speed into the final furlong but kept on well and will take up the ebor option coming off an 81 day break since his group race fifth he was halved in price to 8 1 by hills and paddy power and totesport made him 7 1 favourite
4706512 hes a lovely horse very tough and very genuine and id say you could do anything with him now
4706513 we wanted him to win a black type race as weve still got the dam dalis grey and weve also got her selkirk colt in the first part of the tattersalls october yearling sale the hope with bauer is that he could be good enough for group races in the autumn
4706514 a successful start to the five days of glorious goodwood with six runners today it would have been disappointing not to have a winner but we emerged with one winner and two seconds hopefully setting the tone for the next few days it was sanbuch who obliged in the 1m6f detica summer stakes and was chased home by bauer half a length behind him the race was an ideal target for the pair of them and while it is frustrating to have one of your horses beat the other it is pleasing to see them both run such good races sanbuch is one of the more intelligent members of his species and unless asked to work he does not see the need for it todays blinkers were fitted to help ryan moore get the horse around the first mile and half and he needed only to get serious with him in the last two furlongs it was sad to see black rock break down in the last furlong and you cannot guarantee that we would have beaten him lets hope he makes a full recovery it looks like bauer will now be the more likely candidate for the ebor because he will escape the four pound penalty that his stablemate will receive for winning today it is great to see him back on song today and it shows that he really does only find his form later on in the season for one reason or another

4706710 you dont want to put too much into one and say that one is more important than the next because you never know
4706711 the long stride that i had before which sometimes helped me in college is not going to help you that much in the nfl
4706712 guys who are incredible quarterbacks like joe flacco can sometimes get away with it but i had to change mine up so i could compete
4706713 he has worked as hard in the offseason from a technical standpoint as any quarterback ive been around
4706714 everybody talks about that it just takes time for the quarterback to develop
4706715 but what youre seeing is him develop chemistry with his receivers smith is in a new system and has a lot of new guys that always takes time hes more accurate today than he was yesterday hell be more accurate tomorrow than he was today
4706716 sometimes when the ball is not perfect our guys wont catch it
4706717 guys doing things like that stepping up day in and day out is what keeps us going
4706718 the guys always been a leader always been a winner
4706719 he has a knack for getting open once you put it in his vicinity hes going to catch it
4706720 i feel like he trusts me to make the right decision on the field whether hes scrambling or throwing into tight coverage that im going to come down with it
4706721 once you get the quarterbacks trust it keeps building and getting better and better
4706722 i just need to get over the end of the game
4706723 well the only thing that sucked was i didnt get to do any special teams
4706724 normally on opening kickoff its time to go but i had to wait a little bit
4706725 if it comes to me making a play out there then im ready to be that guy to make the play
4706726 i dont really have anybody else to look at thats the problem
4706727 there isnt anybody there thats very dynamic with the ball
4706728 were worried that if johnnie cant do it were in a little trouble in the return game
4706729 i thought we could just sneak him the ball in there

4706742 i would like to focus on one type of kind of boring content which is data and databases its different from text and movies even though some people might think here that youtube is almost a database of videos right because you can find a video you can put a keyword and stuff but its quite different im thinking about what i look for when im looking for data and im talking about numbers im talking about consumer reviews prices my group works a lot on access to medicines so we have to have a lot of numbers when it comes to the price of medicines all over the world we would like the fda the u s federal agency that regulates drugs to put down on some kind of website for example the drugs that are publicly funded that would be a great kind of data we would like to have so thats what i would like to talk about because even though i have seen a wonderful thing happening for text and videos blogger really freed a lot of people from the technical parts of writing and now anybody can do a blog i mean my father can start a blog and hes in his late eighties and you see that for videos i mean not me and not my father but my kids they upload their videos and all that but i havent seen any of that for data and databases am i the only one who likes to have evidence based policy
4706743 hes essentially a lord of the manor keeping the serfs at a low wage
4706744 taxpayers beware what you dont know can cost you an inquiry into questionable and hidden compensation for public school administrators
4706745 theres no question that if you look at it in a vacuum thats a lot of money for the kids served

4706750 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4706751 the integration of the peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4706752 the maoists will try to bring in populist and radical economic reforms but financially they will have lots of constraints

4706767 campbells light touch with the art beautiful yet often disturbing watercolors proves supple and fluid enough to convey scenes of whimsy and scenes of horror this might just be my favorite campbell yet i cant recommend it highly enough
4706768 you will love rediscovering the joy of a wild adventure comic that you cant stop reading you will love laughing at each inevitable change of fortune that makes leotards life so amazing so remarkable you will love once again letting eddie and dan best take hold of your consciousness and imagination and turn them inside out and upside down on the wildest ride youll find in comics this year

4706772 its a fine eddie campbell book in the style that no one else could replicate and a joy to read
4706773 the franklin expedition is a key part of canadas history of arctic exploration as canada is once again asserting ourselves and protecting our sovereignty in the high arctic this expedition will provide important new information and will add to the body of research on the fate of these ships
4706774 an actual discovery of these wrecks would offer unprecedented information on the exploration of canadas north and the discovery of the northwest passage a critical piece of our shared history and important to present and future generations
4706775 fear and not willing to make good choices has stopped people dead in their tracks from accomplishing great things in their life

4706781 although quite apparent even before yesterday their desperate attempt to collect a new dna sample is clearly a last ditch effort to build a case when there was none
4706782 this report makes a mockery of the so called impartial police investigations and clearly shows the dubious but persistent attempts to incriminate me by whatever means employable
4706783 how else can we fathom why the police in the last four weeks of their thorough and professional examinations overlooked such a critical piece of evidence
4706784 ijam kau jaga adik adik ayah nak bawa kak milah kau ni ke klinik tegas pak ali

4706792 the whistleblower alleged that the logistic department of the police force had failed to comply with the standard operating procedure sop when conducting procurement including the buying of dogs during the general election in march
4706793 allegations have also named six high ranking officers ranging from asp assistant superintendent of police to cp commissioner of police
4706794 if one government agency does not follow the sop it will lead to malpractice and corruption
4706795 we decided that the best way to uphold transparency is to call a press conference to tell the public about it

4706797 the credibility of the malaysian justice system as a whole is therefore atstake the integrity of professionals be they doctors or lawyers must never be interfered with the public must be left in no doubt that the criminaljustice system in this country will not be misused or abused
4706798 pihak polis dengan tegas menafikan kenyataan tidak berasas seperti yang terkandung dalam artikel tersebut
4706799 nobody wants a repeat of 1998 when the prosecution had to amend the charges anwar has alleged that he had an alibi for the 24 hours on the day the offence took place so the authorities have to check everything out
4706800 we understand that there is an attempt to quash credibility of the case even before the matter goes to court the police cannot say too much because then they will be accused of trial by media and ministers cannot say much because they will be accused to interference
4706801 how else can we fathom why the police during the last four weeks of their thorough and professional investigations have overlooked such a critical piece of evidence
4706802 i condemn in the strongest terms their negligence dishonesty and recklessness in humiliating the nation by dragging us all through this vile

4706808 i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous that we dont all have the same rights
4706809 unprecedented response on friday to its call for bids to host the tournaments including one from 85th ranked jamaica which has never played at a world cup
4706810 this is tremendous news for rugby world cup irb chairman bernard lapasset said
4706811 the fact that 10 member unions have signaled their intention to tender for the 2015 and 2019 tournaments reflects the growing global prestige of the rugby world cup

4706889 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization

4706891 these solutions are flexible the student will be moving a few times throughout college and you want something that can be adjusted to different places
4706892 is the art of chivalry dead or just the need for chivalry
4706893 do you think chivalry is dead in the northwest should it be
4706894 its not just chivalry thats dead its good manners in general awareness of others is the key and sometimes i think people here are so self absorbed that noticing if someone else needs help just isnt on the radar screen i open doors for people i like having them opened for me i wear tennis shoes on the bus and i dont expect a guy to give me his seat when its offered it surprises me ive offered my seat to tired looking mothers and older people in general isnt kindness and noticing other people worthwhile
4706895 ive lived in seattle almost 50 years and have rarely seen any evidence of chivalry back in the early 60s when i began working for boeing i worked as a graphics illustrator and had to haul big 20
4706896 when i was 9 months pregnant and only women would offer me their seat on the bus i realized chivalry was dead in this city the men would all pretend not to see me and being 9 months pregnant i was pretty hard to miss but almost always a woman would be kind enough to offer her seat so i wouldnt have to stand from seattle to bothell manners exist here but they seem to be mostly in the women
4706897 females of our city have cured me of my chivalry a pregnant woman screamed at me when i offered her my seat on a bus she also swung her bag at me and others thought i was attacking her i always hold doors for females or males i have been cursed by quite a few women for doing so the men say thank you my parents taught me through example to help others or offer help in these parts the men are more appreciative than the women it has constrained my actions considerably
4706898 i think that chivalry is antiquated and lopsided why should men perform acts for women because were women that we can very well do for ourselves and anybody notice that there are no corresponding customs that women employ to show deference to men because theyre men more thoughtful considerate acts from either side of the gender divide devoid of simpering expectations would render this discussion irrelevant
4706899 perhaps men have grown weary of being treated like chauvinists when offering help to women the women in this city have consistently demonstrated that an offer of assistance from an unknown man will be treated with suspicion and contempt i myself have found that women typically respond as if i am harassing them or making a sexual advance by making even the simplest gesture of chivalry it would seem that i am not alone in learning that it is a wasted effort this is a situation that has been created by the women of seattle you wanted equal treatment and now you have it
4706900 i think too many men are concerned with offending someone due to the vocal pc minority i hold the door for a woman because im a gentleman not because shes necessarily a lady
4706901 i dont think chivalry is dead at all i find that if i as a women am courteous to another person it is generally reciprocated almost daily people open doors for my husband and me as we do for them even a young man insisted he carry my goods to my car the other day because i was struggling another young man opened the door for us with a smile i do think that people are busy they are busy texting and chatting on their phones and are not always aware of their surroundings

4706923 by deploying poland is exposing itself to a strike 100
4706924 it is rare that all the blame is on one side in fact both sides are probably to blame that is very important to understand
4706925 profound implications for russia this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics you cant be a responsible member of institutions which are democratic and underscore democratic values and on the other hand act in this way against one of your neighbours
4706926 russia has every time been testing the reaction of the west its going to replicate what happened in georgia elsewhere
4706927 we are looking evil directly in the eye today this evil is very strong and very dangerous for everybody not just for us
4706928 georgia has been attacked russian forces need to leave georgia at once
4706929 must take place and take place now this is no longer 1968
4706930 our ground forces never crossed the border of the conflict zone
4706931 but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except russian peacekeepers
4706932 this clearly demonstrates the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe has as its aim the russian federation
4706933 no one involved in the advert appears to have considered it inappropriate nor contemplated the manner in which it could be interpreted in china and elsewhere
4706934 no offence was intended by the advert but whether the chinese see it that way is a different matter and it is likely to provoke more criticism at a delicate time for spanish sport
4706935 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
4706936 members of the madrid 2016 committee suspect that behind the guardian s accusation exists a plan by certain people in the anglo saxon world to dirty spains name over their bid for the games
4706937 it seems that no one read the original i didnt accuse anyone of anything
4706938 in bad faith by some members of the press so we reserve the right to take appropriate legal action
4706939 we thought it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as affectionate nevertheless some of the european media did not see it this way
4706940 i would like to say that we have a huge respect for the orient and their people some of my best friends in toronto are from china and one of our spanish national team sponsors is the chinese brand li ning
4706941 some of us didnt feel comfortable doing it to me it was a little clownish on our part to be doing that the sponsor insisted and insisted they pushed because theyre the people that pay the money it was just a bad idea to do that it was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody
4706942 but we understand the team apologised and the athletes meant no offence whatever so as far as we are concerned the matter rests
4706943 at least we wouldnt have been able to come back to the us there would be suspensions
4706944 they wont do anything to them its a double standard
4706945 we recognise that in america this is going after somebody who is more comfortable with technology
4706946 the truth is that in other countries its becoming a part of their culture the trend is coming and as a fashion company its very important to identify trends and get ahead of them
4706947 this is about someone whos interested in our brand and interested in technology and wherever the two meet thats whats appropriate

4707017 the mccain camp is building a case about obamas ability to lead and needs to keep the pressure on his weakness with voters
4707018 the ads are less an effort to get votes than make a point and get it covered by the national media while obama has the attention of the nation
4707019 no doubt the obama campaign will do the same now

4707055 we had previously demonstrated that grp stimulates the growth of this particular cancer
4707056 this time we wanted to demonstrate the opposite effects by targeting grp receptors in neuroblastoma to see if we could make the cancer regress
4707057 in order for cells in a soft agar colony to proliferate and grow without adhering to a surface they have to possess malignant properties as in the original neuroblastoma cells
4707058 however our grp receptor silenced neuroblastoma cells behaved like nonmalignant cells their growth was significantly inhibited and they formed fewer new colonies
4707059 we wanted to see how these neuroblastoma cells would behave whether they would grow and or metastasize to the liver
4707060 the cancer cells that expressed the grp receptors behaved as we expected with rapid growth as well as aggressive liver metastases the implication is that the metastatic behavior of this cancer is driven by grp and its receptor
4707061 with the publication of our data we would like to propose an application involving a number of institutions to move forward with a phase 1 clinical trial using this fda approved grp receptor antagonist for neuroblastoma
4707062 we hope to demonstrate the safety of targeting grp receptors for effective inhibition of neuroblastoma growth and metastasis this is just such a tragic disease and with all the advances were making we ought to be able to make a dent in it

4707064 but in this case barry i want to be very clear
4707065 if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about alonso and arsenal if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions if you want to talk about football then you talk with me

4707073 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4707074 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4707075 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4707076 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4707077 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4707078 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4707079 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4707080 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4707081 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity
4707082 i hope you didnt invite any vampires over for dinner
4707083 hey its okay well fix it but well save some of this for those two jokers
4707084 i thought you told mercado you didnt know anyone that could help him
4707085 i decided jake needed something to keep his mind off rose for a little while thisll do him some good
4707086 do you really think its a good idea to have jake go do something like this on his own youve seen all the drinking hes been doing not to mention all the fucking i think its drained his brain
4707087 leave jake alone he knows what hes doing youd be surprised at what he can accomplish on only a few hours of sleep besides hes ready to go do something on his own
4707088 just like i stick up for you with him like always
4707089 listen jakes gonna be fine hes done jobs like this a million times for dad and uncle jesse this time hell actually get paid
4707090 youre mad i didnt give this job to you thats what this is about
4707091 you know hes the best security guy we know im sorry sebastian but you dont even come close what were you gonna do sit outside the guys warehouse with a shotgun cmon
4707092 you know what im talking about stop being such an ass
4707093 she wasnt at first actually youre a lot like her in that area she liked to improvise and sometimes well most times we ended up ordering pizza or just going out to dinner
4707094 here stir this sauce do not add anything else not even if alexa makes a bet with you
4707095 i dont want you to be mad i think this is best for jake
4707096 this guy i know asked if i knew of a security guy and i volunteered jake for the job i asked jake if he was interested you know just meet the guy and then he could go from there
4707097 hes not a screwball hes just different than what youre used to
4707098 hes a screwball and a danger to your brother this kids always been running off at the mouth trying to start his own business what is it this time
4707099 hes running guns nothing too big just small stuff dad all he wants is a guy to set up a security system at his warehouse nothing too fancy just something to deter the wrong people
4707100 im not sure i like this your brother going off on his own its dangerous
4707101 chance i think jakes going to be fine maybe this is what he needs something to keep his mind occupied until that girl of his comes back
4707102 dad jakes not going to want to be doing this forever he needs another option
4707103 i think youre right in the end it has gotta be his decision not yours or roses his
4707104 what im not trying to get him out that ship sailed long ago i just think that one day hes gonna wake up and find that he doesnt like what hes doing this way hes got something to fall back on
4707105 yeah he set up a meet and theyre going to go over what daniel wants its a walk in the park jake can do this with his eyes shut
4707106 its evidence in an ongoing investigation he cant have it back yet
4707107 nothing that cant wait ive just been hearing things about alfonso arrellano and how his guys are treating the street girls
4707108 oh well hell be interested to hear about it thats his arena
4707109 dont ever go behind my back again if you want to help your brother out come to me first
4707110 yeah well everyone feels fine after they wake up its the passing out were concerned about people dont just pass out for no reason strange things happen to kids at pools if we were comfortable with you not going to the hospital we wouldnt stand around trying to convince you otherwise
4707111 will you at least drive him to the hospital yourself wed have no problem telling you that he doesnt need to go to the hospital if that was the case
4707112 i will not in any way shape or form consent to this ama take him to the ed and get the cops if you need to ill even talk to the cops if they have any questions this kid needs to go to the hospital
4707113 yeah the parents are adamant about not going im kinda glad you said that
4707114 thanks incident number is xxxxxxx and the pts last name is yyyyyyy
4707115 ive been all over the world and this countrys got the worst doctors
4707116 is there a doctor thats going to come see him i think this whole thing is completely unnecessary but in any event i want to know about every test thats going to be performed on him and why its being performed
4707117 youll get my vintage 13 inch philco over my cold dead body
4707118 i was able to theoretically confirm that planned design changes to the current bifilar fault current limiter being developed by siemens and american superconductor would decrease ac losses in the system
4707119 my calculations are good news for the future of the device
4707120 i modeled the bifilar design as an infinite stack of superconducting tapes in which adjacent tapes carry current in opposite directions
4707121 i was able to find an exact solution for the magnetic fields and currents that are generated in such a stack of tapes once i calculated how the magnetic flux penetrates into the tape i then could calculate how much energy is lost in each current cycle for different tape widths and spacings between adjacent tapes
4707122 clems result was not obvious since there are competing mechanisms for ac loss in the bifilar configuration it turns out that for typical parameters when the spacing between adjacent tapes is small enough the result is very simple ac losses decrease as the tape width increases and the spacing decreases
4707123 this result is helping to guide us and our partner siemens in an optimized design for a fault current limiter in a major doe sponsored program and it is expected to open a path to a commercial product in the future

4707125 ich erinnere mich an den ersten formel 1 test den ich in valencia im jahr 2000 absolviert habe
4707126 damals war die stadt noch winzig doch sie ist wie verr ckt gewachsen um zu einer sehr coolen city zu werden es gibt dort tolle orte wo man ausgehen kann und alles bewegt sich sehr schnell

4707128 jetzt werden sie f r die formel 1 eine gute show liefern ich denke dass valencia sich sehr schnell als einer unserer lieblings grand prix etablieren wird dadurch dass es sich um einen stra enkurs handelt wird es das gewisse etwas an flair haben und eine echte herausforderung f r die fahrer sein diese strecke zu lernen
4707129 am anfang wird es dort noch sehr staubig sein sie werden ihren speed daher eher langsam steigern m ssen weil die barrieren keine fehler verzeihen werden ich mag stra enkurse sehr gerne und es w re verdammt sch n dieses wochenende mitfahren zu k nnen

4707135 ive been shooting for kambakht ishq in la yeah i play akshay kumars sibling we both play stuntmen so it kind of runs in the family and its a family that runs fast the role requires considerable physical skill and energy
4707136 the stunts are dangerous but everything is so professional here in hollywood safety while doing action scenes is top priority not just for the lead stars but also for the stuntmen otherwise the experience of working at universal is no different from the studios back home

4707150 it is very difficult to say at this point whether after the olympics chinese society will become more open
4707151 there is always back and forth struggles between the authorities and the grass roots and citizens
4707152 theres still a lot of tension and the grass roots need to push their work forward
4707153 it has played a great role whether its about banning disposable chopsticks or sorting trash everyone at the mention of the olympics said they should do a better job
4707154 but since the olympics is already here the government had no choice but to move the agenda ahead
4707155 still has a long ways to go in engaging with civil society as true partners
4707156 i feel that for the disabled in china it cannot be called discrimination but unequal opportunities but for now it is improving and the pace will pick up because of the paralympics especially in job employment
4707157 we hope it is not just a flash in the pan
4707158 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4707212 our eyes met during last nights orgy i couldnt catch
4707213 the challenge of learning a new circuit is always exciting particularly when it is an unusual venue such as the new street circuit in valencia despite preparing as much as we can in advance of the race our track walk with the engineers on thursday and the practice sessions on friday will be absolutely key to learning the track and assessing the grip levels
4707214 a new track always opens up the field and gives an opportunity for the driver to make an impact as our feedback will be very important in achieving the correct set up we have prepared well and i am looking forward to the weekend and the potential to score some points
4707215 the mosport circuit is without question the fastest track on the alms calendar with much of the first part of the lap flat out throughout high g force corners its also a demanding race for the body and mind that literally takes your breath away its fantastic
4707216 an arms race that few can even hope to compete in much less win
4707217 embracing open source development crowd sourcing content targeting different platforms such as the web or mobile phones all of these are valid
4707218 they arent responding to the changing market because they dont understand how to work things like web technologies into their current income models
4707219 so instead they keep doing the same things just more of them and with higher budgets
4707220 my first thoughts are that its a circuit that we havent raced at before and its got barriers all around it i think the whole of formula one is very excited about going to valencia its a beautiful city and it will be great to be racing around the streets there
4707221 we have a simulator at our uk base as do most teams and spending a lot of time on that has been vital in terms of learning the circuit
4707222 we have some very fast circuits like monza spa and silverstone on the calendar and then the slower circuits like monaco and hungary and were expecting valencia to be somewhere in the middle

4707234 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4707235 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4707236 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4707237 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4707307 in the second half we came out defensively and took care of what we had to
4707308 err ill tell you another time maybe could we please just hurry to my house
4707309 oh come on i live by myself in an apartment on the 2nd floor
4707310 the least i could do is get you out of this rain

4707312 and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god having the glory of god her brilliance was like a very costly stone as a stone of crystal clear jasper
4707313 and the material of the wall was jasper and the city was pure gold like clear glass
4707314 and the twelve gates were twelve pearls each one of the gates was a single pearl and the street of the city was pure gold like transparent glass
4707315 and he showed me a river of the water of life clear as crystal coming from the throne of god and of the lamb in the middle of its street
4707316 and he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes and there shall no longer be any death there shall no longer be any mourning or crying or pain
4707317 and let us not lose heart in doing good for in due time we shall reap if we do not grow weary
4707318 you can take it to the bank you will eventually reap the good you have sown maybe not now maybe not soon but eventually it will come
4707319 some refer to bob as tireless and it may appear that
4707320 we balance the budget the way we run the club i have money available to buy
4707321 we go into the competition but the target is also to balance our budget which i think every manager should do
4707322 three or four years ago we went into a different policy that we have to be shrewd
4707323 i can make signings at very high prices but you have to have cohesion in the way you buy
4707324 manchester united are in the 20 30million bracket chelsea are in the unlimited bracket we have to be in our own bracket reasonable but shrewd
4707325 big signings reassure but good performances are much better we opted for stability with young players who have the spirit of our club
4707326 we always want to buy the right player at the right price but when you want to move a club forward like i did here in the last 10 years you also need investment not only for players
4707327 the quality of a manager is also to develop young players to spot them when they arent necessarily stars
4707328 if i had the choice to buy a player for 30million and win the title i would do it
4707329 its a big year for stoke city and its also a big year for me on a personal level
4707330 i am loyal to our supporters and people at the club but more than anything i am loyal to the players
4707331 we have built up a really happy relationship and strong spirit and i desperately want them to succeed
4707332 if they are going to do that i have to help them by bringing in new players who will strengthen the side and give us a better chance of closing the gap on those above us and being in europe every season that hasnt happened this summer and i feel i have let them down
4707333 at the end of last season i wouldnt have thought it possible we would be sitting here in august without a single new face
4707334 it hasnt been for the want of trying and i have to say the chairman bill kenwright has been fantastic
4707335 he cant wait to go to old trafford and play for united
4707336 he has never spoken publicly on the situation out of respect for tottenham
4707337 the number of artists that he was involved with and helped significantly or just made great records with the list is almost unbelievable
4707338 at this time in my life i thought i would be on a cruise ship to panama or the mediterranean retired with my tilley hats my sneakers but im a single lady now and i want to keep working
4707339 i then have to pinch myself to make sure that i am not in a dream and then when i have done that and i realize that i am not dreaming i am just totally happy
4707340 when i was young i dreamt of breaking this record and when i touched i knew that i had won but i did not know what my time was going to be so when i saw that i had broken it by more than two seconds i was amazed
4707341 i have heard that she is working as a commentator at these games and it would be wonderful to meet her
4707342 my whole family has supported me and my parents have just about watched every race that i have swum
4707343 he is always quite emotional and it was great that he was there to cheer me on
4707344 i will be staying till the end and we will be going to watch some other sports together as a team and then i also hope to watch some others like athletics
4707345 i wouldnt be here without bill i have swum with him since i was 12 or 13 he looked after me when i was ill he just built me up and to be honest i just could not have done it without him

4707349 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4707350 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4707351 the no 1 issue is lets get the long term tax credit in place now so that my friend john doerr in silicon valley can put money into renewable energy and create jobs
4707352 al gore wants to go to the batteries and thats fine with me but we are not going to make a big cut in 10 years without natural gas
4707353 natural gas is a bridge to batteries and hydrogen it will give you 20 years until you get the right battery and hydrogen technologies
4707354 america faces a choice a continuation of the bush cheney mccain approach that perpetuates the failed policies that have produced soaring prices or a comprehensive bipartisan strategy that develops new and traditional sources of energy
4707355 im excited to hear the national anthem play and for everyone back home to hear it
4707356 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4707357 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4707358 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4707359 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4707360 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4707361 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4707362 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
4707363 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4707364 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4707365 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4707366 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4707367 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4707368 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4707369 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4707370 what do you want your look to say to people
4707371 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4707372 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4707373 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4707374 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4707375 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4707376 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4707377 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4707378 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4707379 not in favour of traditional marriage and i pray that we wont get stuck with him
4707380 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4707381 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4707382 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4707383 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4707384 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4707385 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4707386 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4707387 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4707388 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4707389 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4707390 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4707391 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4707392 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4707393 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4707394 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4707395 yes i can say that they patched the most serious of the vulnerabilities but i cannot confirm that they have patched or havent patched the other two
4707396 if you look at our timeline youll see that there was some disagreement about whether the two bugs were security bugs
4707397 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4707398 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4707399 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4707400 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes

4707403 increasingly optimistic that the risk of a h5n1 pandemic will diminish this year to practically zero though you know were not out of the woods yet
4707404 the persistence of the virus as a replicating entity in water at 4 degrees c about 40 degrees f is better and longer than at 37 degrees c body temperature but in buffered water was consistently and constantly present for more than 50 hours at 4 degrees c in buffered water it was still there after two weeks thus the stuff doesnt just disappear in the environment it can be around for days or weeks after being deposited

4707413 with her its not i want to look good in that dress
4707414 she wanted to start moving around because she thought it would make her feel better
4707415 she told me they said some rude mean things but thats not why i wanted to change
4707416 he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
4707417 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years
4707418 hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
4707419 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
4707420 commitment and dedication is something you shouldnt have to address as a professional
4707421 but its definitely something well have to address before the next game
4707422 why would i want to wish the drp leader any ill by creating a
4707423 its amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper
4707424 they will all be held in jail until they were convicted
4707425 i need to fix this to use that much more water than most residents is unacceptable i have no interest in being the top water user in austin texas
4707426 we condemn the act of the jumhooree party who have tried to bribe our parliamentarian group
4707427 we are a political party we wouldnt do things like this
4707428 i dont think parliamentarians would ever offer or accept bribes
4707429 the only people who bribe anyone is the drp and president gayoom
4707430 all the local contractors in the maldives are in the red zone

4707435 where are the big boys at i want the big boys to step up and i want to fight for the belt
4707436 im not very pleased with myself but its a win at least
4707437 i could have done a lot of things better he was tough i had a good amount of ring rust coming in and i wasnt able to execute as well as i wanted to ill get back in the gym and ill be at 100 for my next fight here
4707438 who am i lord that you would use me in this way
4707439 who am i lord that i get the honor and privilege of witnessing this miracle of salvation
4707440 croatia right now is playing their best water polo and for us to beat them and control this game today shows that were definitely in contention for a gold medal
4707441 well celebrate for five minutes then get ourselves ready for monday
4707442 today was my day it came out well i was able to achieve the gold medal which i have wanted for a very long time
4707443 this is something ive been doing my whole life im so overcome with emotion
4707444 i will continue to struggle and work hard hopefully this is the start of many good things to come
4707445 if i am ready to swim and win in an olympic final with the best swimmers in the world
4707446 then i am ready to tackle the media the difficult part is behind me i gave up a lot of things to concentrate on my training so easier things are before me im pretty much ready for anything
4707447 it is a wonderful beautiful medal it is something huge when you look at the level of performance in these races it is not any worse than the 100 meter gold it is the same value
4707448 we didnt think we could beak hong kong were very moved
4707449 if we get down and we dont come back were not champions and were not men
4707450 i just happen to get one i could handle and get it over the fence
4707451 our offense has been shut down and im still trying to figure out why
4707452 but i think before the season is done well go on a hot streak
4707453 we want him in there because hes one of the leagues elite offensive players but lets make sure hes all right for the long haul
4707454 were strong from birth and from the work we have to do some of us dont have a father some dont have a mother and have had to work from a young age
4707455 i thought it was horrible a really hard sport something for men not for women
4707456 but my coach told me sweet things every time i did well and gave me chocolates
4707457 hes a hero to the younger generation and the pride of older chinese
4707458 there are only very few chinese athletes with this level of fame
4707459 we need to solve several problems together including recovering from injury improving competition form and helping him with his rhythm
4707460 although time is tight i think we can solve these problems
4707461 if robles runs his very best the cuban can beat him
4707462 garbage collectors would inspect san francisco residents trash to make sure pizza crusts arent mixed in with chip bags or wine bottles under a proposal by mayor gavin newsom
4707463 jimmy i dont want you playing with the williams boys anymore their family doesnt recycle
4707464 we now live in a society where sunday church attendance is down but people wouldnt dream of missing their weekly trek to the altar of the recycling center
4707465 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4707466 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4707467 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4707468 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4707469 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4707470 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4707471 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4707472 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4707473 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4707474 the thoroughbred who leads too early and by too great a margin is more often than not the vulnerable one the one in danger of losing it all to the horse who strategically holds back waits and then thunders in the final furlongs to finish first
4707475 wake up youre liberal how we can take america back from the right
4707476 why it makes a difference public figures on their faith
4707477 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
4707478 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
4707479 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
4707480 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
4707481 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4707482 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4707483 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4707484 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4707485 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4707486 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4707487 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4707488 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4707489 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4707490 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4707491 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4707492 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4707493 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4707494 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4707495 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4707496 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4707497 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4707498 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4707499 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4707500 it felt like history in the making one of those landmark films that people will be talking about for ever
4707501 we were always frustrated that people saw cg computer generated imagery as a genre as opposed to just a medium that could tell any kind of story we felt like we widened the palette with
4707502 i dont have much of a political bent and the last thing i want to do is preach i just went with things that i felt were logical for a possible future and supported the point of my story which was the premise that irrational love defeats lifes programming and that the most robotic beings ive met are us
4707503 its a wake up call telling people that the stewardship of the planet is a simple human responsibility but also that its a humans responsibility to live their life themes are not just topical theyre universal if you dont take action and you dont take responsibility and you dont exert your humanity you can lose it thats a timeless message but its not one you see in hollywood movies every day
4707504 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4707505 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4707506 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4707507 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4707508 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4707509 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4707510 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4707511 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4707512 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4707513 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4707514 the first paper i ever gave on climate change was trying to disprove that increases in greenhouse gases could be causing these observed trends in temperature
4707515 i was a sceptic the starting point was that this cant be happening what we actually found was the more and more we looked the more and more agreement there was between greenhouse gas increases and warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the stratosphere which is the pattern under climate change
4707516 i become frustrated because there is no requirement to be truthful in an opinion piece
4707517 it is amazing to me that rather than going to csiro the national academy of sciences in the us the australian academy of sciences or other scientific organisations from around the world that are all consistently providing the same evidence a significant proportion of the federal shadow cabinet and many others in the liberal party and national party and other interest groups are collecting information not from reputable sources but from websites which may or may not be funded by a right wing lobby group or a fossil fuel company which says there is a conspiracy but im not surprised people like to hear information that confirms their underlying beliefs
4707518 if you dont believe them you really should go read what the original scientific papers say
4707519 i had this dilemma first of all when i was approached that its stupid because they are not going to listen and they dont care but then i thought about it a little more
4707520 its better to be engaged and try to do it from the inside as part of the process than to snipe from the outside and to be ignored
4707521 it is probably becoming more reasonable to say the state government is no longer burying its head in the sand but it might just be looking in the other direction when some important decisions need to be made
4707522 i am very very concerned that it will have negligible impact for the first five to 10 years
4707523 we were effectively tossing coins and finding nine out of 10 are coming up heads and thats over 29 000 coin tosses
4707524 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4707525 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4707526 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4707527 jackson browne a woman beater has been druggy musician objects to a war hero using his song
4707528 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad
4707529 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4707530 wow all the leftists disparaging the service record of one of our war heros amazing not surprising though
4707531 isnt it funny whenever someone scores a point against the republicans the only response they can make is to trash the character of the person scoring
4707532 the suit claims that use of the song violates the lanham act by falsely implying that browne is associated with or endorses the mccain candidacy the suit also claims the commercial violates brownes right of publicity under california law
4707533 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours

4707538 ive met the old girlfriend and she is lovely she is more beautiful than she was before irresistible
4707539 i am just delighted to be back i just want to be back doing what i do and thats living the life of a bullfighter
4707540 so i thought id better go and get a checkup just to make sure
4707541 that would undermine the purpose of the payments which was to avoid public disclosure of the affair
4707542 the idea that edwards finance chairman can independently hand over substantial sums of money to two campaign workers at a time when edwards is a candidate and to argue that that is not related to his campaign is a bit preposterous
4707543 are entering the building without hard hats without any protective gear but were not getting a straight answer as to whether we can go in or if somebody can go in for us
4707544 its clear kilpatrick knew who detective white was he had previous contact with him through his other case
4707545 you should be ashamed of yourself being with a man with the last name white you should not be a part of this
4707546 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4707547 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4707548 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
4707549 it is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic
4707550 poland is an independent country and its an ally of the united states and its a democratic country to whose security the united states is committed
4707551 is there life on earth is there life after birth
4707552 within the decaying pure breeds a new breed unites and brings with it even more destruction

4707565 brasil segredo has been my little secret but i want females around the world to know how freeing it is to be truly comfortable confident and sexy in their own skin while continuing to capture class and beauty with minimal tan lines
4707566 locals in hawaii are the essence of these women that i speak of and i have created this swimwear collection for them to enjoy
4707567 it is very difficult to say at this point whether after the olympics chinese society will become more open
4707568 there is always back and forth struggles between the authorities and the grass roots and citizens
4707569 theres still a lot of tension and the grass roots need to push their work forward
4707570 it has played a great role whether its about banning disposable chopsticks or sorting trash everyone at the mention of the olympics said they should do a better job
4707571 but since the olympics is already here the government had no choice but to move the agenda ahead
4707572 still has a long ways to go in engaging with civil society as true partners
4707573 i feel that for the disabled in china it cannot be called discrimination but unequal opportunities but for now it is improving and the pace will pick up because of the paralympics especially in job employment
4707574 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4707575 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4707576 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4707577 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4707578 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4707579 friends are the most important ingredient in this recipe of life
4707580 i still dont know what happened i trained well and these things never happened before in training
4707581 wenna has improved a lot in a very short period of time so im also happy to see her succeed
4707582 i dont have any worries about how we are going to show up saturday
4707583 this club is good about wiping stuff off and starting over
4707584 any time you can get a win against a caliber club like the white sox are its definitely huge
4707585 you see this kid throwing the ball real well then all of a sudden one hitter just turned everything around
4707586 he did a tremendous job once again and gave us a chance to win unfortunately he wasnt good enough
4707587 my whole body was out of sync it seemed that my arm was dragging on every pitch
4707588 it was about the third inning that i was able to make adjustment and feel comfortable
4707589 croatia right now is playing their best water polo and for us to beat them and control this game today shows that were definitely in contention for a gold medal
4707590 well celebrate for five minutes then get ourselves ready for monday
4707591 i expect our numbers will certainly go up from here
4707592 were getting into the time where its even more critical
4707593 all blood banks in the united states are screened for west nile
4707594 the vice presidency is the most important decison i can make before i become president this will be my final councelor in the white house
4707595 that is about as lucrative a program as ive ever heard of
4707596 you wouldnt be able to find that anywhere in corporate america or elsewhere
4707597 i lose more money than i make during the session our work is a 365 day a year job so there has to be recognition of that
4707598 we must take that last long jump to universal availability
4707599 if you believe it is a priority why wouldnt you fully fund it
4707600 i think just about every other state in the union offers it
4707601 it is outright unacceptable that the daniels administration turned its back on the states most vulnerable hoosiers of low income children adults and seniors opting instead to forge ahead with another attempt to privatize more of indiana all under the guise of savings
4707602 ive been going over jills plan and im tremendously impressed
4707603 why is the size of your premium determined by the size of your business thats just not right im going to make it possible for small businesses to negotiate lower insurance rates like big companies
4707604 jon stated stay out all night sleep all day because that is what i would be doing by saying this jon really emphasized taking advantage of every day
4707605 how it was lived thats what matters in our memory and in the world to come
4707606 you have in my view achieved the highest level of citizenship raised a good son
4707607 i think that its a very significant statement by speaker nancy pelosi last night that to use her words the house can have a vote on more domestic drilling this represents evidence that the democratic leadership is hearing from the american people is hearing from many democrats in the congress who would like an opportunity to vote on more domestic drilling and i welcome it but i still believe congress should not wait until this fall or sometime around christmas after the elections to give the american people more access to american oil
4707608 it would be better to give less of a raise and have jobs than give bigger raises and then in a year have to cut
4707609 should the assessing duties of the elected township assessor in the township be transferred to the county assessor
4707610 porter county is not an island its not a gulag
4707611 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4707612 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4707613 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4707614 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4707615 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4707616 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4707617 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4707618 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4707619 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4707620 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4707621 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4707622 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4707623 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4707624 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4707625 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4707626 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4707627 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4707628 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4707629 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4707630 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4707631 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4707632 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4707633 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4707634 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4707635 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4707636 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4707637 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4707638 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4707639 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4707640 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4707641 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4707642 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4707643 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4707644 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4707645 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4707646 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4707647 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4707648 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4707649 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4707650 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4707651 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4707652 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4707653 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4707654 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4707655 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4707656 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4707657 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4707658 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4707659 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4707660 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4707661 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4707662 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4707663 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4707664 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4707665 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4707666 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4707667 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4707668 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4707669 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4707670 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4707671 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4707672 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4707673 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4707674 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4707675 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4707676 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4707677 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
4707678 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
4707679 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
4707680 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
4707681 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
4707682 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
4707683 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
4707684 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
4707685 dream lofty dreams and as you dream so shall you become your vision is the promise of what you shall one day be your ideal is the prophecy of what you shall at last unveil
4707686 did not agree with the united states that we had taken the necessary steps to comply
4707687 in my view it is probably a restrictive practice and we might take it up in another form
4707688 it was really really incredible all of a sudden i saw a swirl starting to form and then it was amazing but it then touched land
4707689 this site is run by a bunch of muppets youd be much better off at wikipedia
4707690 we support the teaching of alternative theories on the origins of life including darwinian evolution creation science or intelligent design and that each should be given equal weight in presentation
4707691 stars and crystals were all connected smoke pot and you will know everything new age and understand the universe la la la la
4707692 bubbly i have been told lol oh im in 9th grade by the way
4707693 take all the fucking faggots out in the back woods and kill them
4707694 courts routinely strike down school prohibitions on speech as overbroad where there is no express requirement that the speech be disruptive and hence unprotected under tinker
4707695 i think that all the gays and lesbians should be put on an island somewhere and they will breed themselves out
4707696 you cant make overly broad restrictions on speech in public schools
4707697 given that we have x what is the best way to go about formulating x
4707698 let the students do whatever they want provided it doesnt cause a riot
4707699 what i need to know is which of these snakes is

4707703 the cold war isnt back the russian attacks on georgia dont mean american soldiers will soon be staring at red army soldiers in the middle of germany or that u s defense spending must triple to match a global russian military juggernaut
4707704 american rhetoric about russias actions has been strong but has not deterred putin from pushing even harder
4707705 there are some people who do not understand at all but just like my voice i add new lyrics and modern instruments to attract the audience this has been very successful
4707706 they even killed female goats because their private parts were not covered and their tails were pointed upward which they said was haram
4707707 they regarded the cucumber as male and tomato as female women were not allowed to buy cucumbers only men
4707708 i saw them slaughter a nine year old boy like a sheep because his family didnt pledge allegiance to them
4707709 very heavy handed killing of civilians backfired on them the sunnis just wouldnt stand for it any more

4707713 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4707714 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4707715 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4707716 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4707717 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

4707719 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4707720 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
4707721 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
4707722 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
4707723 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
4707724 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
4707725 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4707726 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4707727 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4707728 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4707729 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4707730 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4707731 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4707732 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4707733 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4707734 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4707735 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4707736 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4707737 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4707738 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4707739 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4707740 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4707741 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4707742 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
4707743 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
4707744 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
4707745 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
4707746 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
4707747 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
4707748 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
4707749 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4707750 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4707751 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4707752 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4707753 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4707754 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4707755 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4707756 im just trying to make good contact there and i crushed the ball
4707757 the first pitch was a fastball then im watching his release on the next pitch and the fastball comes again and i got all of it
4707758 the guys put us in a spot to win the ball game and i screwed it up in the ninth
4707759 it was a situation when i didnt execute my pitch and he made me pay for it
4707760 i like the way these kids get after it for nine innings
4707761 im happy for the team this has been a difficult place for us
4707762 ive been rushing a little too much and ive been working with the pitching coach on correcting some things in my approach
4707763 we had a chance to add on a run but we didnt

4707780 spend time in a debate with people who make empty promises
4707781 the president is busy working on implementing the new constitution and without considering the time of the head of the state is not acceptable
4707782 our beloved candidate is not interested to participate and spend time in a debate with people who make empty promises and who do not have a balanced campaign
4707783 if an incumbent is contesting mdp have the right to request the incumbent is there
4707784 he has been too used to a one party system and he finds it difficult to confront the reality of young dynamic leaders in front of the public if he claims he is leading a multiparty democracy one would believe he would be there
4707785 no country annnounces these sort of political debates without discussing with the participants
4707786 i cant speak for those organisations but as an observer im concerned that a sitting president doesnt feel its his job to defend himself against his challengers
4707787 all parties were well informed of the rules of the debate last week they the drp shouldnt have waited until the day of the debate

4707806 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4707807 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
4707808 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
4707809 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
4707810 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4707811 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4707812 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4707813 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4707814 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4707815 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4707816 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4707817 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4707818 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4707819 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4707820 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4707821 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4707822 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4707823 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4707824 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4707825 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4707826 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4707827 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4707828 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4707829 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4707830 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4707831 when he hit it i was thinking that i hope this is something that can turn our season around
4707832 we know where we are but weve got a lot of young guys and maybe this is something that will give us a little motivation
4707833 this is a big pick me up for all of us
4707834 before the game he said something to me that just clicked about what i was doing when im swinging well
4707835 i went in there and i saw the ball well i felt really good
4707836 im just happy it got out winning the first game in a series is important especially against a team the caliber of the white sox
4707837 she had cramps and was very uncomfortable she had diarrhea and was throwing up she was pretty miserable
4707838 i really turned it on and let it go everything came together i feel so fortunate there was a point in the race i thought things could go really well or really bad
4707839 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and shut it off
4707840 i have no secrets i just run im ready for my best i got my stride back
4707841 i just know i need to relax and do the things my body knows best im just really glad i got to the final
4707842 im living this for the thousands of people i grew up with and those who raised me
4707843 he was genuine and you could feel the love and concern he had
4707844 i was thinking why do both of them have to be running together
4707845 he said explain to me in detail what youre doing here
4707846 he was concerned about me and he wanted to know step by step what i did
4707847 he noticed mr johns hat that he was a cement mason and they talked about it with him he made it his business to understand
4707848 global companies have to adapt to operating in markets with very high growth rates it puts a strain on manufacturing capabilities and demand for talent

4707854 it is of paramount importance that crucial election related legislation is now enacted key independent institutions such as the electoral commission and supreme court must now be created speedily these institutions must enjoy wide public and political confidence in terms of their membership independence and capacity so that the reform process begun in 2005 can be successfully concluded

4707884 thats one of the reasons im diametrically opposed to michael
4707885 michael is a night owl i am an early morning person it drives him crazy
4707886 training with bob is the smartest thing ive ever done
4707887 it has structure that is very clearly defined it has a melodic element it has an element of tone in it and it has a percussion element it also has what they would call a sardonic or sarcastic element
4707888 i remember at age 11 seeing him and thinking he was the meanest guy ive ever seen
4707889 i told myself there is no way im swimming for him sure enough 12 years later were still doing the same thing
4707890 but its all in michaels best interest maybe its not whats best for him in that moment but bob can see down the line if youve got children and you want to take good care of them it doesnt mean you let them do everything they want to do youve got to put your foot down sometimes
4707891 first he came out and asked me to tie his tie
4707892 then he came out with his shirt buttoned one off the whole way so i had to re button it
4707893 were business partners we are family in a definite way and we have to interact with each other on a lot of different levels so its very complicated
4707894 i have a picture of michael and i from indianapolis that was taken just minutes after he made the olympic team the first time at age 15
4707895 and if you could see the look on his face both of us really its so purely happy i keep that on my desk and every time im discouraged for frustrated i just look at that picture and it makes me happy
4707896 during this season of practice ive noticed that nastia has been doing double routines on the floor exercise
4707897 sometimes she would do two in a row and that is a very difficult thing extremely tiring and exhausting
4707898 it was a great performance but it was so heartbreaking for shawn i could see how disappointed she was
4707899 ive said this before many times its really dangerous to be the it girl the year before the olympics on the one hand you have the enormous publicity and the endorsement money the other side of the sword are the expectations and pressure
4707900 the difference was a small slip on my grip on the high bar
4707901 but in most cases if you go against the athletic types the athletic types win mary lou retton carly patterson those types beat out longer lankier athletes who cant stick the landings like mighty mites history shows the shawn johnson type athlete usually wins because the scoring system rewards the athlete
4707902 i think if it was over today hes the greatest olympian who ever lived
4707903 i do think its difficult to compare different sports but in terms of just sheer dominance in his events and the times hes putting up and what hes doing now in two olympics i think its hard to argue
4707904 being compared to the greatest olympian of all time thats not bad
4707905 but i want to do something that no one else has ever done before i want people to look at me as being one of a kind
4707906 he is the single greatest olympic athlete of all time now
4707907 he will be probably the single greatest athlete compared to anybody in any century the 20th the 21st century whatever
4707908 you know you judge a persons character by the company you keep and im glad im keeping company with michael phelps ill be happy to stand aside and let him carry the torch hes just one great athlete and its very exciting to watch him
4707909 mark was a very talented swimmer and very dominant in his time
4707910 i think that the difference with michael is that he has a much more challenging program and i think that the competition throughout the world is more challenging
4707911 its apples and oranges its a different ballgame technology has changed their personalities are different im not saying anything negative about spitz but his time is gone its time to turn the reins over to somebody else
4707912 michael is the best in the world in three different strokes
4707913 its totally unusual for anyone to have a talent like that in those three different strokes michael jordan was talented in basketball but he couldnt hit the baseball could he
4707914 when i do lose like that it just motivates me to swim faster
4707915 i never thought id see this type of swimming in my life its absolutely going to be something for the ages a hundred years from now people are going to remember these olympics for what team usa and especially michael did
4707916 if you lose they say hey youre a good guy
4707917 im sure that the team plan was to throw it right at the guys head no game in baseball is worth that as far as im concerned
4707918 the ball hit the bat and then hit him in the face
4707919 the timing system says it all there hasnt really been an error with the timing system i raced as hard as i could and the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first
4707920 when youre really focused on your dream anything is possible i saw so many quotes saying its impossible it wont happen it shows you
4707921 hes the best olympian of all time not just in the pool but in the way hes handled himself
4707922 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4707923 im not angry im not angry at all technology is also imperfect its possible i won it was just a crazy finish its too bad we couldnt have both finished at 50 58 i would have loved to share that gold medal i think if we got to do this again i would win
4707924 and i think it would be good for him if he lost once just once
4707925 when i heard that milorad said it would be good for swimming if i lost it fired me up more than anything
4707926 i know cavic pretty well and i know phelps pretty well and i like cavic but if he had won i would have been pissed
4707927 i said congratulations to michael which doesnt really cut it for the week hes had what do you say to that shake his hand and shake your head and wonder if anyone will ever come close to doing that again not in my lifetime
4707928 relief excitement everything when i saw the first next to my name thats when i sort of let our my roar
4707929 i had to take my goggles off first to make sure the no 1 was next to my name
4707930 you can see it when hes on the medal stand hes very emotional over the whole thing he knows he appreciates whats happening
4707931 if there is no passion in your life then have you really lived
4707932 din punctul meu de vedere adi nu are nici o vin nu era treaba lui s se ocupe de chestiunile n cauz vinova i sunt cei din jurul lui oamenii care erau pl ti i s se descurce n asemenea situa ii dar asta e noi n am mai lucrat cu mutu ne am desp r it imediat dupa ce el a plecat de la chelsea
4707933 in a bit of historical revisionism swift boat veterans for truth founder and unfit for command co author john oneill distorted jerome corsis role in co authoring the book
4707934 simply an editor and not really any sort of co author
4707935 unfit book materials show corsi more than just an editor
4707936 one of the authors of a new anti john kerry book frequently posted comments on a conservative web site describing muslims and catholics as pedophiles and pope john paul ii as senile in chat room entry last year on freerepublic com corsi writes islam is a peaceful religion just as long as the women are beaten the boys buggered and the infidels are killed in another entry he says so this is what the last days of the catholic church are going to look like buggering boys undermines the moral base and the lawyers rip the gold off the vatican altars we may get one more pope when this senile one dies but thats probably about it
4707937 the real reason behind president bushs push for immigration reform says author jerome r
4707938 the late great usa the coming merger with mexico and canada
4707939 any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11
4707940 yesterday jerome corsi was prattling on about the north american union again after michael medved deservedly spanked him for spreading conspiracy theories while i dont think corsi is any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11 i thought i would respond to him one last time i think thats about the fourth time ive said that now why respond again whats the point well unfortunately a lot of conservatives consider this conspiracy theory to be so preposterous that they believe its beneath them to even bother discussing it and that leaves corsi and his ilk to dominate the debate and since there are a lot of conservatives being taken in by this north american union nonsense somebody has got to step up to the plate
4707941 i guess there are people who believe in the plan for a north american union but there are people who believe in bigfoot
4707942 all his life jerome corsis been told that were running out of oil
4707943 i remember driving with my dad in a 1952 plymouth and listening to him talk about the end of oil
4707944 im at the point where the dinosaur theory seems silly
4707945 you take a pile of cats and you bury them dig them up 10 years later and you dont get oil
4707946 the truth is that there is so much oil around the world that its been easy to find
4707947 were awash in oil theres more oil today in proven reserves than ever before in human history
4707948 after their bitter campaign 2004 experience with the swift boat veterans for truth john kerry and his fellow dems arent waiting to be shot at again yesterday aides to sens kerry hillary clinton joe biden and ted kennedy jumped all over literary mugger jerome corsi co author of the kerry bashing best seller unfit for command they knocked him to the ground and kicked him in the face metaphorically anyway over his next democrattrashing tome atomic iran how the terrorist regime bought the bomb and american politicians the book which nashvilles cumberland house publishing wont release till next month claims democratic pols are being corrupted by iranian money and helping the nuke seeking mullahs in tehran
4707949 though not a veteran himself corsi co authored unfit for command swift boat veterans speak out against john kerry
4707950 lets see exactly why it isnt the case that islam is a worthless dangerous satanic religion wheres the proof to the contrary
4707951 islam is like a virus it affects the mind maybe even better as an analogy it is a cancer that destroys the body it infects
4707952 first lets undermine the us in vietnam then we can go for gay marriage when you get to be pres jfk lite there will be no end to how much of america we can destroy
4707953 just dont let anybody put a tablet with the ten commandments in front of the school where that girl wants to wear a muslim scarf oh no then the rats would complain anti christian anti american just like their presidential candidate jean francois kerrie
4707954 after he married terrahsa didnt john kerry begin practicing judiasm he also has paternal gradparents that were jewish what religion is john kerry
4707955 john f ing commie kerry and commie ted discuss their plan to hand america over to our nations enemies
4707956 forget about democracy just get out the checkbook and put everybody in iraq on the payroll thats all they want pay them first democracy or some b s islamic version of it will follow
4707957 mohammed al mohammed proclaiming guidance from his hate god ned allah kills another dozen women and children by convincing a teenager to blow him her self up for victory in another world
4707958 another mohammed al mohammed islam religion of hate maniac bites the dust
4707959 certainly cant be one of the islam is a religion of peace hijackers
4707960 one more mohammed al mohammed el mohammed mohammed iced great
4707961 car bomb kills egyptian islamist in lebanon camp 3 1 03
4707962 let them build mosques seems about all the germans are worth these days
4707963 islam is like a virus it affects the mind maybe even better as an analogy it is a cancer that destroys the body it infects a throwback medieval anti modern anti science anti knowledge doctrine
4707964 forget it the only thing these islamonazis understand is force time to nuke the temple of the dome and send this
4707965 go for the oil fields set the mad dog lawyers loose lets roll take even the diapers from their heads remember according to the koran islam approves of lying as long as it is to non believers saudis are lying killers who harbor killers

4707971 may islam join the garbage heap of worthless religions we have grown beyond any believers of hermes out there
4707972 all arab muslims lie the koran endorses lying to infidels namely us none of these names are real abdallah is really mohammad mohammad mohammad readily altered to include atta or haj or whatever else they decide to call themselves for the moment
4707973 gotta love this stupid religion islam makes the nazis look like a sunday stroll in the park islam its gotta be straight from hell just the devil in disguise that seems to about sum it up
4707974 arabs lie islam preaches lying to infidels fingerprints dont lie boo hoo time to demand ids to check into hotels and passport registration for all foreign nationalists who want hotel rooms also id checks and passport registrations for anyone renting an apartment
4707975 lets get rid of all the saudi arabians that would have gone a long way to preventing sept 11
4707976 yet another violent raghead named mohammad whats new islam looks like a cancer a plague a deadly virus no doctor worries about the free speech rights of cancer cells
4707977 yet another little islamic man of hate is there any other kind
4707978 the only thing the islamic world understands is force lets destroy a few of these hate schools and start targeting these mad preachers of hate
4707979 lets see who is it not politically correct to profile
4707980 finally a way to end jihad maybe the whole arab world will blow itself up live by the sword die by the sword seems an ancient formula bye bye jihad
4707981 i repeat muslims cancer cells its hard to tell the difference no doctor worries about the first amendment rights of cancer cells the therapy is to eliminate cancer cells so the body can go on living great to repeat it keeps the thread going let the muslims stop preaching terror and ill revise my view meanwhile muslims cancer cells is an equation that works
4707982 may all these arab maniacs explode and kill themselves next time maybe they will take arab rat with them best solution to the homicide bombers is that they eliminate themselves with as little loss to civilians as possible

4707984 muslims cancer cells its hard to tell the difference no doctor worries about the first amendment rights of cancer cells the therapy is to eliminate cancer cells so the body can go on living
4707985 we find there is even uncertainty whether stanley ann and obama senior were ever married in a church
4707986 on feb 2 1961 several months after they met obamas parents got married in maui according to divorce records
4707987 other sources say divorce papers confirm that a civil ceremony was held on maui on february 2 1961 when ann was three months pregnant with obama
4707988 senator obama could claim to be a citizen of kenya as well as of the united states obama can trace his heritage back to his mother who was born in the united states and was an american citizen when he was born and to his father who was born in kenya and was a kenyan citizen when obama was born

4707998 i think this is the best crowd we have had for a number of years and judging by smiles on faces throughout the past 10 days everyone has had a ball
4707999 im sure that the team plan was to throw it right at the guys head no game in baseball is worth that as far as im concerned
4708000 the ball hit the bat and then hit him in the face
4708001 the chinese team has no chance to even play against us if the olympics werent held in china
4708002 in asia the japanese koreans and taiwanese are good at it because they have been occupied in one form or another by the americans
4708003 there are all these undercover cops videotaping us during the games
4708004 they are afraid we might unfurl the taiwanese flag or do something political why would we we know we will be arrested
4708005 it was an amazing game we totally did not see this coming we are not in the same league
4708006 they were so well organized they had their own songs and chants at first we didnt know what we were doing then we tried to copy them and started cheering together for the chinese side and the chinese team started to catch up i guess it really helped
4708007 we have never lost to china before i am sorry i had to witness this first defeat especially when it happened here in beijing
4708008 even though you say you dont care about what people think thats not true
4708009 i had so many good memories here im expecting for the best but im preparing myself for the worst
4708010 i dont say anything theres nothing i can say its in the past you know its been settled i dont know what else to say

4708023 fred will continue to work closely with the taqa north management team as well as corporate headquarters to ensure connectivity across all of taqas business sectors
4708024 i dare say that international organizations will not state that the elections took place in non alternative conditions
4708025 perhaps international organizations will clear their positions regarding the most azerbaijani opposition parties took a decision not to participate in the elections however no statement is expected to be made like neither opposition contender participated in the process due to the elections were held in non alternative conditions if someone did not participate in the elections he cannot say that it took place in non alternative conditions i hope that electorate will see me as an alternative candidate the fact that most opposition parties will not participate in the elections will not affect voters activity
4708026 we think to hold mass demonstrations to restore freedom of assembly as well as demonstrations in the context of elections in accordance with the legislation not only the forces which participate in the elections but also the forces which do not participate in the elections have the right to hold mass demonstrations and express their position in the elections campaign
4708027 in accordance with musavat assemblys decision made on 2 august consultations should be held with other political forces and the non governmental organizations ngo on the observation of the elections if common opinion is reached at the consultations then we will think about observation therefore we will make a final decision only on observation after consultations
4708028 none of regional organizations and people who are in the position at collegiate elections bodies objected partys decision there can be different opinions amongst common members of the party and this is normal
4708029 a total of 191 ngos engaged in different fields will receive azn 1 2mln

4708031 democratic society cannot develop without political parties ngos and independent media institutions therefore development of these fields is in the centre of the azerbaijani states attention

4708037 i think a lot of us identify ourselves with our job and i know for me personally i had to ask myself what now what am i going to do with the rest of my life now and i was afraid i was going to end up sitting on a couch listening to jerry springer
4708038 we got together a bunch of newly blinded veterans from iraq and afghanistan to provide camaraderie
4708039 the majority of those people return back to their communities and they really dont have anybody with shared experiences
4708040 it said that our people die 25 years before people who dont receive our services and the reasons were all smoking related
4708041 it was shocking were a health care agency and we were doing things that are not healthy
4708042 ive done nothing in my career except psychiatry and weve been hesitant to go there with our patients
4708043 one thing that would just break my heart was when people would say to me i didnt smoke until i got here and there was nothing else to do during the time when everyone was out there smoking
4708044 there was concern that going smoke free may discourage people from getting psychiatric treatment and also concern that for people who have very limited rights within the facility this is a thing they choose to do and if theyre there for a long period of time that they are being deprived of something that other people have as a right
4708045 but a ban by itself is cruel you need to provide nicotine substitutes recreation and other structured activities so people are not having something taken away from them
4708046 people who use nicotine have to use more psychotropic medication to receive the same level of benefit as a non smoker
4708047 the problem is that is if they get stable in my facility and go back into the community and begin to smoke again they may not have enough medication
4708048 we have a few more hoops to jump through but my guys now have more of a health conscious focus about leading their lives now
4708049 well go through the rejected signatures to make sure that any that should have been counted will be counted were confident it will qualify for the ballot
4708050 among the largest failure rates in the history of our state
4708051 this is an indicator that the problem is systemic the whole process needs to go through a review
4708052 the majority of signers are just not registered to vote
4708053 any child in crisis it is our goal to reach that child and give them a hug through a new blanket
4708054 it means a lot to a child to receive something like this
4708055 when you go without for so long you dont feel good about yourself and you tend to think everythings your fault
4708056 this was something i did to get out of the house
4708057 ive had tons of material that ive been hanging on to over the years now that im retired i wanted to do something with it
4708058 i retired and moved way west and didnt know anybody
4708059 this is the only way i can make friends whenever i can i come down and take part
4708060 if you dont know somebody you go up and introduce yourself
4708061 we are looking forward to meeting with the limousine companies who we will have contact with next week
4708062 it reminds us of how much we miss her but its a celebration of her spirit she would have loved this she would have been up there cheering with the chandler high cheerleaders
4708063 and of course it was out of respect for haley too she was such a dynamic person
4708064 markets are growing so rapidly because demand is so high among consumers
4708065 a lot of markets are seeing increases in sales increases in customer counts its hard to keep up with the supply
4708066 though farmers market vendors are having to increase prices they are still very competitive because they dont have huge infrastructure and fossil fuel expenses
4708067 most of the evidence is anecdotal but some might find shopping at the farmers markets has become even more economical
4708068 look at places like santa monica calif where they have two to three blocks of farmers markets
4708069 theres something for residents but visitors as well because the offerings are pretty broad
4708070 weve added 2 500 residents to units in our downtown this past year alone
4708071 now that weve got people living here we need basic neighborhood services
4708072 estoy muy tranquilo porque jugar con compa eros de este calibre te deja muy contento
4708073 you dont have to create as much as you had to earlier in the year
4708074 we have to wait for that part of the lineup to come up again

4708076 the number of artists that he was involved with and helped significantly or just made great records with the list is almost unbelievable
4708077 he loved black music r amp b music and rhythm and blues was his foundation he had a feeling for it he had the knack to keep it going in his heart and recognize the talent that he felt was real
4708078 jerry wexler didnt change the sound of america he put the sound to the public he opened the doors and windows to the radio stations and made everybody listen
4708079 i earned it i worked for it that was the deal i dont like feeling powerless
4708080 what its really done is cast a cloud over the retirement years of men and women who worked 30 40 years to earn these benefits
4708081 now the security of their retirement has really been placed in doubt
4708082 historically rochester was one of the very very best areas for not only medical costs which were managed largely by the corporations since they were paying the bill but you had people like joe wilson at xerox the people driving kodak these people had a commitment to the community and they provided benefits to their workers that were second to none in the united states
4708083 weve watched rochester drift from absolute best and world class for benefits and employee relations to being mediocre a lot of it has to do with the business climate a lot of it has to do with the leadership of these companies is no longer local its been brought in from the outside
4708084 the major thing medicare does not provide for is catastrophic situations where theres a serious extended illness
4708085 you take an open heart surgery or cancer treatment those become very expensive in a very short time
4708086 this sort of legislation might be well intentioned to help retirees but it would accelerate the demise of retiree health coverage
4708087 the fact of the matter is they already are dumping these programs if businesses are serious about these concerns i wish theyd get behind us and work for a universal health care plan not just a tax credit something that shows theyre not serious about it
4708088 they have to pay for it out of their current expenses
4708089 the tax laws have been a real obstacle for companies
4708090 i dont want government involved and i dont think i can trust corporations
4708091 the only person who can ensure my future is me
4708092 it is very difficult to say at this point whether after the olympics chinese society will become more open
4708093 there is always back and forth struggles between the authorities and the grass roots and citizens
4708094 theres still a lot of tension and the grass roots need to push their work forward
4708095 it has played a great role whether its about banning disposable chopsticks or sorting trash everyone at the mention of the olympics said they should do a better job
4708096 but since the olympics is already here the government had no choice but to move the agenda ahead
4708097 still has a long ways to go in engaging with civil society as true partners
4708098 i feel that for the disabled in china it cannot be called discrimination but unequal opportunities but for now it is improving and the pace will pick up because of the paralympics especially in job employment
4708099 in a lot of ways his later work could have done with something as good in its centre a lot of the two lone swordsmen stuff sounds unfinished good but missing an ingredient
4708100 i try not to charge too much or else they will not hire me
4708101 i think im doing a good job its probably the only time during the week i can have to myself but dont tell that to my wife
4708102 i try not to charge too much or else they will not hire me
4708103 but everything is more expensive so you need to optimize as much as you can
4708104 business is definitely not what it used to be customers say theyve been on tight budgets a lot of people who were scheduled for new equipment have canceled and decided to just let it sit for a few more months
4708105 if i didnt have it id be a lot happier right now

4708107 people are trying to reduce the amount of chemicals theyre using and trying to save a few dollars but its shortsighted because youll eventually have a big problem

4708109 ive never raised prices in the summer before its a worldwide crunch

4708139 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life

4708190 it was there from the first lap the first turn
4708191 we tried some things during practice that didnt work at all
4708192 so we went back to where we were and i think thats one of the best qualifying cars ive ever had it was a heck of a lap sometimes you just hit it you dont know why
4708193 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4708194 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4708195 they accepted the ruling because it was not the human eye making the judgment
4708196 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4708197 there is no doubt the question was for him to share or not to share first place there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps
4708198 in the old days the judges ruled now its the timers
4708199 technology is also imperfect the hand is quicker than the eye
4708200 they couldnt believe phelps got there and im sure ill feel the same way
4708201 there hasnt really been an error in the timing system that ive ever heard of the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first
4708202 im not about fighting it im not angry at all
4708203 i think we showed a lot about the american spirit
4708204 we keep fighting no matter what obstacles are in our way even if we were underdogs going into this match we didnt care we knew we could do it
4708205 shes got a heavy arm ill give her that much i thought she did a great job she got a lot of sets tonight and she put a lot down give her credit
4708206 weve got a lot of experience so i think we know how to deal with it and turn that energy for us
4708207 this is why we train so many hours a day and we dont have lives most of the time we play for these kinds of moments
4708208 our main strategy out there today was playing as a team that is the strongest thing usa volleyball has going for it
4708209 i sat down for a second and said you got one chance to change the outcome
4708210 let it go clear your mind and let it happen i got lucky thats not a very good throw most of the time it wont get you a bronze so i cant complain
4708211 sometimes it doesnt go sometimes it feels like that ball is 100 pounds i feel terrible it worked out the way it did reese has been the man the last few years adam has so many silvers hes got more hardware than any of us ever will
4708212 im not going to use that as an excuse i have no idea
4708213 the european guys are catching up theyre very talented unfortunately today we didnt put any american muscle out there i felt good i felt excited i was ready to crush it then when i started warming up it wasnt there youre going to feel pressure this is the olympics theres a lot of expectations
4708214 for the normal public we allocate a very strict policy for people to buy tickets
4708215 each person can only buy a certain number of tickets so its very precious and they will want to see the match
4708216 for some contract clients theyre probably delaying their trips to the events the first few days they have several choices to watch and theyre being shown around beijing so later things should be better
4708217 its like this at every olympics because of corporate sponsors we have the tickets wish i had more
4708218 i was a little nervous before the race but i think that was my best race ever my dream was to be an olympic champion and that is now realized
4708219 its hard to come this far and know i have a faster race in me
4708220 it was a pretty good race result its my best time its fun its a lot of fun being in a big race like that
4708221 my start is not where it needs to be against a field like this
4708222 in a race like the 50 it doesnt always work out that way
4708223 id also like to explore china not just the olympics ive seen the village and the pool its been a long 10 days
4708224 she had cramps and was very uncomfortable she had diarrhea and was throwing up she was pretty miserable
4708225 i really turned it on and let it go everything came together i feel so fortunate there was a point in the race i thought things could go really well or really bad
4708226 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and shut it off
4708227 i have no secrets i just run im ready for my best i got my stride back
4708228 i just know i need to relax and do the things my body knows best im just really glad i got to the final
4708229 im living this for the thousands of people i grew up with and those who raised me
4708230 obviously im a little disappointed everybody goes into the race wanting to win but its an improvement on my bronze in the 100 backstroke so overall im very happy
4708231 i never knew it was going to be like this i just got in there and did my best its absolutely amazing ive worked so hard and it paid off i absolutely cant believe it
4708232 right now im happy to be a san francisco giant my only plan is its up to these guys team management my job is to play as hard as i can and the rest takes care of itself i want to be an impact player for the giants for a long time
4708233 hes the type of player we need we want to bring in a lot of players like him i dont like to put a timetable on anybody and i definitely wont put one on buster but i will say he has the ability and makeup to be a team player to help us win
4708234 roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4708235 cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
4708236 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4708237 explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values
4708238 every speech should contain the line you were born in the middle of america to the middle class in the middle of the last century
4708239 i was born into a middle class family in the middle of the country in the middle of the last century
4708240 i know that there is a genuine effort to unite the party and i think you are going to see plenty of evidence of that during the convention itself
4708241 i am absolutely baffled that anybody would say that barack doesnt meet every single test of genuine americanism when you consider his life story
4708242 he has a phenomenal life story and i think it is one of his great assets to be raised by your grandparents and to be raised as a minority and to rise up and live out the american dream is the essence of america
4708243 i tell you i have seen a lot of democratic consultant stuff that was half baked and crazy and this is as half baked as it gets you pay for it that is the sad thing about it
4708244 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
4708245 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
4708246 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
4708247 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
4708248 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
4708249 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
4708250 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
4708251 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
4708252 we really want to get the message out to people
4708253 i got back the standard form letter thank you for your comment
4708254 tumors shrank when the genetically engineered mice were injected with a cannabinoid
4708255 im excited its been a long summer a lot of talks going on these last few weeks
4708256 the last few days have been hectic i havent slept much with all the traveling and trying to get a deal done
4708257 its a relief now to have it done and start my professional career and do what ive loved to do since i was a little kid play baseball
4708258 we did try to take it down another road for a good part of the summer
4708259 but there was a point in time that we had to realize as a club that we needed to do this to make this thing come together
4708260 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4708261 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4708262 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4708263 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4708264 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4708265 hes so locked in if there is a man on base he seems to turn it up even more
4708266 that year was an outstanding year i was hitting like 370 all year theres no way i can feel better than that year
4708267 hes running hard hitting the ball on the button he looks locked in its that simple i hope he stays that way
4708268 id like to have one more chance without a doubt
4708269 it really would have to be the right place and the team that did it would have to believe i wouldnt walk away
4708270 i never would have thought he would be putting me through some of the stuff that im going through now
4708271 i cant even get in contact with him when i need the things that i need for my baby its just hard
4708272 for the type of money that he makes 2 000 is nothing
4708273 she wants him to know if you pay what youre supposed to pay youll never hear from me again but as soon as you stop im going to be there protecting my kid
4708274 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4708275 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4708276 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4708277 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4708278 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4708279 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4708280 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4708281 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4708282 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4708283 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4708284 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4708285 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4708286 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4708287 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4708288 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4708289 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4708290 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4708291 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4708292 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4708293 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4708294 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4708295 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4708296 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4708297 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4708298 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

4708319 the guys made a lot of big plays behind me asdrubal cabrera especially ive told him about it four times since the game ended
4708320 now its a matter of when his mobility comes back he can play again
4708321 i was watching him and i was thinking to myself youre pitching on the olympic team in this venue and you were just in high school a couple of years ago
4708322 its amazing that hes gotten to that stage what a great opportunity for him and for us as an organization to have two guys over there who are that young with that exposure on the world stage
4708323 there werent a lot of people talking while it was intact
4708324 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4708325 i always wondered what my feelings would be i feel a tremendous load off my back somebody told me years ago you judge ones character by the company you keep and im just happy to be in the company of michael phelps thats the bottom line
4708326 im so proud of what hes been able to do
4708327 i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4708328 the americans have never lost that race since its been an event in the olympic games
4708329 you have to be very cautious on the relay exchanges and make sure nobody gets disqualified but it should be just a matter of what the time is going to be and whos going to put the gold medal around their neck first
4708330 when he hit it i was thinking that i hope this is something that can turn our season around
4708331 we know where we are but weve got a lot of young guys and maybe this is something that will give us a little motivation
4708332 this is a big pick me up for all of us
4708333 before the game he said something to me that just clicked about what i was doing when im swinging well
4708334 i went in there and i saw the ball well i felt really good
4708335 im just happy it got out winning the first game in a series is important especially against a team the caliber of the white sox
4708336 my interpretation is this was probably the result of poor information given to the athlete
4708337 we are on the heels of those who try to cheat
4708338 there is an increased awareness in the sports population that doping is unacceptable
4708339 if the cat and mouse are quiet is the mouse in hiding or is the cat asleep
4708340 may well be increasingly cowed about calling positive inevitably labs are behind the curve
4708341 some of these drugs work unbelievably well to the point where you cant compete against someone if you dont take them no matter how talented you are
4708342 is like the story of the dutch boy who puts his finger in a hole in the dike but then another hole pops up thats whats been going on for 40 years
4708343 i had a lot of great up and downs today there were a few holes where it could have gone either way and i just grinded it through im proud of myself for shooting under par today and it sets me up for saturday and sunday
4708344 we are making progress but we still are not able to keep up the pressure for the whole game
4708345 hes got the pace of marvell wynne and can get by players
4708346 were very thrilled to have him he adds youth and were looking forward to working with him
4708347 the jonas brothers are on the same cover as me so it kind of removes some of the coolness of that i guess

4708356 ive been working on a new algorithm that will make it easier to determine the likelihood that future vintages of particular wines will be better than previous vintages

4708359 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4708360 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4708361 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4708362 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4708363 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

4708366 look its no secret that there are a number of banks that would like to adjust their credit exposure to residential real estate in california or in other states to allow them to refocus on their core business and deliver value to their shareholders
4708367 and selling assets is one way of achieving that objective
4708368 its not going to happen if youre coming for that youll be disappointed

4708377 i know my mother was mad at me i was supposed to go by her house before i left for china but i just didnt want to do that goodbye
4708378 i was trying to stay calm and not think about it and the last thing i wanted to see was her face like its the last time im gonna see you because i know what happened the last time or im gonna have to come see you again like i did the last time i didnt want to go through that whole emotional deal she wouldve got emotional and i wouldve got emotional
4708379 i was trying to take her hand out of my back and she was trying to keep it in
4708380 the two ambulance guys said youre not going to stop us were taking him right now
4708381 i dont remember the first 12 days in the hospital
4708382 all i remember is i got this he fingered a small bump near his mouth because i kept trying to take the ventilator out of my mouth to ask them how eric was and to ask them about aaron smiths then year old son back in dayton
4708383 they the media and track world had basically written her off and were looking for the next up and comer
4708384 thats the only time i was nervous and it wasnt for myself
4708385 to tell her the guy who was killed wasnt me knowing my mom she was probably going berserk
4708386 beforehand bob bowman his coach said it would be good for me if i lost
4708387 i think if we got through this again id win it
4708388 losing by one hundredth of a second is the most difficult loss you can have at the olympics i did see the finish if you ask me if im disappointed its a miracle that im here i retired 1 1 2 years ago in my heart im enjoying the experience for me its an incredible feeling to have come this far i would have liked the gold but im very happy with the silver
4708389 i usually do i know im the fastest in the first 50 i know michael is a back half swimmer the last 15 meters i knew he was there i saw a shadow in the side of my goggles i knew he was coming
4708390 when i did chop the last stroke i really thought it cost me the race but the exact opposite happened
4708391 if i glided in i would have been way too long it was a short final stroke to get to the wall first it turned out to be in my favor
4708392 michael phelps is the greatest weve ever had he would have won the race no matter what hes going to do something tomorrow in the 4x100 medley relay that makes him extraterrestrial
4708393 it was hard to see i had a long finish michael phelps had a short finish im not angry at all technology is not perfect its possible i touched before phelps its not something im focused on its too bad we couldnt have both finished in 50 58 it would have been nice to share the gold medal with him
4708394 my coach mike bottom former cal assistant coach brought some clippers and cleaned my neck he shaved the hairs below my cap who knows if he didnt do that i might have gone 50 60
4708395 i think it really shows that no matter what you set your imagination to anything is possible
4708396 bob was the one who helped me dream about anything he was the one who said dream big dream as big as you can its finally happened its all paid off
4708397 the australians are going to put up a very good relay its all about team were going to go out there and swim as a team hopefully well be able to put four amazing splits together
4708398 well the only thing that sucked was i didnt get to do any special teams
4708399 normally on opening kickoff its time to go but i had to wait a little bit
4708400 if it comes to me making a play out there then im ready to be that guy to make the play
4708401 i dont really have anybody else to look at thats the problem
4708402 there isnt anybody there thats very dynamic with the ball
4708403 were worried that if johnnie cant do it were in a little trouble in the return game
4708404 i thought we could just sneak him the ball in there
4708405 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

4708418 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4708419 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4708420 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4708421 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

4708425 now its a matter of when his mobility comes back he can play again
4708426 i was watching him and i was thinking to myself youre pitching on the olympic team in this venue and you were just in high school a couple of years ago
4708427 its amazing that hes gotten to that stage what a great opportunity for him and for us as an organization to have two guys over there who are that young with that exposure on the world stage
4708428 there werent a lot of people talking while it was intact
4708429 when he hit it i was thinking that i hope this is something that can turn our season around
4708430 we know where we are but weve got a lot of young guys and maybe this is something that will give us a little motivation
4708431 this is a big pick me up for all of us
4708432 before the game he said something to me that just clicked about what i was doing when im swinging well
4708433 i went in there and i saw the ball well i felt really good
4708434 im just happy it got out winning the first game in a series is important especially against a team the caliber of the white sox

4708440 were hitting a wall now and were so close to impeachment proceedings its this commando thing of his his living here would be like a red rag to a bull he wants to be photographed playing golf and taking it easy

4708442 the president has all the options constitutional and political all institutions will be seriously damaged by impeachment perhaps beyond repair
4708443 i tried out many business but could not get success
4708444 buying spices from here has got its own taste and aroma as these are grown locally here using organic methods it remains fresh for long time and price wise its cheap the quantity is also satisfying that is why people come here get a pack with them
4708445 but its definitely easier when theyre younger it gets so much harder theyre very emotional theyre a little slower you have to deal with a lot of other things when theyre younger theyre like a soldier now i have to prove it myself to her we spend more and more time on that
4708446 it wasnt easy for nastia to be second but i never believed nastia was no 2
4708447 some judges maybe like shawn but nastias level of gymnastics is high we calculate our course and come to the conclusion she is not second she just makes mistakes
4708448 this morning when i woke up i knew there wasnt anything else that could make me better
4708449 i just had to give it my all and hope it was enough
4708450 and she now knows that and after the practice im her father but its very hard for everybody im not going to hide that we had our moments credit my wife there she helps out a lot shes always mediator
4708451 i hope he is as proud of this as i am
4708452 it is a jihad because this individual should not be given the chance to destroy the countrys political stability and prosperity

4708455 sepertinya asumsi pemerintah rupiah di level 9 100 cukup realistis sebab selama pemerintahan sby jk rupiah memang tidak pernah menyentuh level di bawah 9 000
4708456 selain gejolak ekonomi global penguatan dolar as terhadap seluruh mata uang dunia juga akan mempengaruhi posisi rupiah tahun depan
4708457 itulah sebabnya mengapa dolar as mengalami penguatan terhadap seluruh mata uang dunia akhir akhir ini padahal belum lama kita mendengar isu tentang resesi ekonomi as hal ini menunjukkan spekulan spekulan itu melihat dolar as lebih menarik daripada komoditas meskipun ekonomi as sedang guncang
4708458 sebagaimana kita ketahui setiap pemilu itu selalu beredar uang politik baik itu uang palsu maupun uang partai ini akan berpengaruh pada nilai tukar rupiah
4708459 tentu ini bisa membuat rupiah menguat namun karena kondisi global sedang tidak menentu sepertinya akan terjadi tarik menarik nilai tukar rupiah akibat kondisi global sebagai faktor luar dan pemilu sebagai faktor dalam negeri

4708502 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4708503 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4708504 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4708505 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4708506 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4708507 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4708508 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4708509 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4708510 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4708511 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4708512 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4708513 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4708514 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4708515 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4708516 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4708517 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4708518 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4708519 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4708520 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4708521 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4708522 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4708523 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4708524 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4708525 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4708526 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4708527 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4708528 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4708529 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4708530 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4708531 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4708532 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4708533 who are open to doing something on the production side
4708534 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4708535 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4708536 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4708537 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4708538 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4708539 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4708540 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4708541 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4708542 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4708543 its a long flight you have to have something we have chicken or beef

4708556 it is very difficult to say at this point whether after the olympics chinese society will become more open
4708557 there is always back and forth struggles between the authorities and the grass roots and citizens
4708558 theres still a lot of tension and the grass roots need to push their work forward
4708559 it has played a great role whether its about banning disposable chopsticks or sorting trash everyone at the mention of the olympics said they should do a better job
4708560 but since the olympics is already here the government had no choice but to move the agenda ahead
4708561 still has a long ways to go in engaging with civil society as true partners
4708562 i feel that for the disabled in china it cannot be called discrimination but unequal opportunities but for now it is improving and the pace will pick up because of the paralympics especially in job employment
4708563 we hope it is not just a flash in the pan

4708573 we are also working on improving our hospitals infrastructure and basic services these are all priorities for our district
4708574 the area south of the wall is improving every day but it is important that we begin work north of the wall to the neighborhoods that have not benefitted from the good works we are conducting because of the threats from special group criminals who care nothing for the people of sadr city
4708575 they were playing as well as anyone here to beat them i think upstairs is where these guys have needed to improve the most over the last couple of years theyve got to know now that if they play like that they can win this thing they honestly can win this thing its a huge boost but it doesnt mean anything unless we win monday
4708576 we played well three of the four quarters but greece scored five goals in the first we cant give up such a big lead in an olympic tournament
4708577 well have to be more consistent in our next game against hungary who are double olympic champions our tournament is not over yet we still can achieve our objective of finishing eighth
4708578 we have to celebrate for five minutes and get ourselves ready for monday
4708579 we came into this tournament and knew we had the capabilities of beating everyone
4708580 this really showed that that game against serbia was a fluke and were a gold medal contention team

4708614 is a month of meaning of repression and radical resistance of injustice and divine justice of repression and righteous rebellion of individual and collective efforts to free the slaves and break the chains that bind us
4708615 we attempted to transform the black criminal mentality into a black revolutionary mentality as a result each of us has been subject to years of the most vicious reactionary violence by the state our mortality rate is almost what you would expect to find in a history of dachau three of us nolen sweet jugs miller and cleve edwards were murdered several months ago jan 13 1969 by a pig shooting from thirty feet above their heads with a military rifle
4708616 i am being tried in court right now with two other brothers john clutchette and fleeta drumgo for the alleged slaying of a prison guard this charge carries an automatic death penalty for me i can t get life i already have it
4708617 dialectical materialism is my bag i identify with anyone who hates just one fascist i don t want a piece of the pie i don t want all of it even i think it s rotten should be discarded we should start all over again this new start should be made without individualism read isolation
4708618 i still think of myself as a black and an african but i can t be satisfied with myself until i am communist man revolutionary man and this without feeling that i ve denied myself or failed to identify
4708619 the black bourgeoisie pseudo bourgeoisie the right reverends the militant opportunists have left us in a quandary rendered us impotent how ridiculous we must seem to the rest of the black world when we beg the government to investigate their own protective agencies aren t the wild hip shooting pigs loose among us to protect the property rights of the people who formed the government
4708620 the theory that all whites are the immediate enemy and all blacks our brothers making them loyal is silly and indicative of a lazy mind to be generous since it could be a fascist plot
4708621 we belong among the righteous of the world we are the most powerful we are in the best position to do the people s work to win will involve taking a chance crawling on the belly naming numbering infiltrating giving up meaningless small comforts readjusting some values my life means absolutely nothing without positive control over the factors that determine its quality

4708638 when you are 2 0 behind you can be satisfied with the result
4708639 we should have been in front but were not careful and conceded the first goal it was disappointing to be 2 0 down but i think the penalty was ok

4708747 euro 2008 will have a halo effect on the wider european economy
4708748 this impact will be felt in many countries principally driven by sponsorship and commercial revenues
4708749 sponsorship is a critical component for us it drives both profitability and recognition of the brand
4708750 for adidas the uefa euro 2008 has already proven to be a great success we have succeeded in carrying on the momentum of the world cup which took place in our home country and are further expanding our market leadership position in the global football business
4708751 this means to use a sporting analogy that we have not only made it through to the next round we are already a clear european championship winner
4708752 if you were happy to pay 37 rupees for a plate of bhelpuri do you think youd even notice an increase
4708753 the dollar is on fire again so thats causing people to re evaluate everything
4708754 it means oil prices could fall dramatically we could see prices get to double digits if this continues
4708755 theyre basically saying we could have an oil glut because demand is slowing
4708756 its obvious that high prices do slow down demand and the market works

4708770 the concept had been on the table for some years now all countries have finally agreed on the formation and implementation of the saarc food bank
4708771 properly realised it would serve as a milestone in strengthening the existing cooperation among the nations of south asia
4708772 this involves the construction of new food warehouses in member countries local procurement and the international purchase of extra food grains and developing an administrative system and a distribution network so it is likely that it will take some time before operationalising the saarc food bank
4708773 farm sectors of south asian countries will be hostage to multinational companies engaged in the seed business if a unified policy on agriculture is adopted for the region on the grounds of food security

4708790 i asked him about the spare and he said that was flat too
4708791 they moved their forces into positions on high ground around tskhinvali
4708792 its very simple the georgians decided to take south ossetia by force
4708793 they thought wed whine like over kosovo but our response was very tough
4708794 we pulled out and they kept bombing because they didnt know we had left

4708807 college a waste of time and money or just kind of inefficient
4708808 certification is good for testing shallow knowledge but its more difficult at assessing deep knowledge
4708809 is the cost benefit package of certification better than the cost benefit package of college for some people
4708810 clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
4708811 no relation to the iranian missile threat but is aimed against russia
4708812 world democratic opinion has yet to realize the alarming implications of president vladimir putins state of the union speech on april 25 2005 in which he said that the collapse of the soviet union represented the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century
4708813 the two sides china and russia shall in the spirit of partnership strive to promote the multipolarization of the world and the establishment of a new international order
4708814 mccain now has enough financial resources to break tradition and advertise during the oppositions convention week
4708815 the mccain camp is building a case about obamas ability to lead and needs to keep the pressure on his weakness with voters
4708816 the ads are less an effort to get votes than make a point and get it covered by the national media while obama has the attention of the nation
4708817 no doubt the obama campaign will do the same now
4708818 hey you know we helped facilitate that we helped make a difference
4708819 the problem with americans is they have an unfortunate habit of seeing the world through an american lens
4708820 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4708821 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is pedaling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4708822 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4708823 it provides for safe and dignified hiring locations where contingent workers can defend their basic rights it carefully balances the interests of business residents day laborers and their employers
4708824 although the complex challenges associated with the presence of day laborers are not specific to one industry nor one company the home depot recognizes that some of our stores in the city of los angeles are impacted
4708825 the home depot has and will continue to work with the city of los angeles and other key stakeholders in the various communities where the home depot operates to jointly address these challenges
4708826 lowes doesnt have the problem and you ask yourself why dont we see massive numbers of day laborers at lowes the reason is they target women its very clear that their marketing scheme is more focused on interior design type customers
4708827 we just dont have the cars denver just isnt really big on chauffeurs
4708828 i am totally booked and have been for six weeks
4708829 a lot of the companies put in reservations for black suvs and apparently the secret service had all of those canceled because they needed the vehicles instead
4708830 as to choosing the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
4708831 and we are aware that the u s is uptight about this project
4708832 but a choice will have to be made someday between considerations of prestige related to an illusory project and a real partnership in matters which indeed require collective efforts
4708833 lets be very clear whose interests are being served by the partnership that russia and the united states have engaged in on iran or north korea
4708834 if i were a neighbor of russia and i saw what russia had done in georgia i would be very nervous
4708835 i think those countries that are leaning toward the west are very nervous today
4708836 pick up the new york times this morning and read the headline
4708837 this is a fact today barack obama is subject to what is probably the greatest concentrated attacks of smears lies and innuendo in the lifetime of anyone who reads these words
4708838 by signing up youll stay on top of what the right wing is doing and help fight for the truth and you can report smears when you see them to keep us on track on what the smear machine is up to at every moment you will be our eyes and ears we know the game weve learned some things and we have a fired up movement of activists like no party has had in decades all networked together with great internet tools so sign up to help this is a massive undertaking so we need your help to pull it off
4708839 this is a fact today barack obama is subject to what is probably the greatest concentrated attacks of smears lies and innuendo in the lifetime of anyone who reads these words
4708840 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4708841 i said from the very beginning that if any such facts prove true we will react in the most serious way the peaceful population should be protected we are investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions
4708842 whats best in me and whats best in my message is consistent with the tradition of hawaii
4708843 end result tomorrow i have an appointment have this mfcs of a tumor eradicated i m out of my insurance network which means i m going to be out of pocket a bit but so what i m getting the best treatment available and i m getting it right now i ll deal with the financial fallout later tomorrow the battle begins linda
4708844 my whole reason why im so mad about it is because democrats need to act like democrats
4708845 democrats work for a living and they have to work and take care of their families and they say these are open to those in the community so they shouldnt ask people to drop everything in their lives for this
4708846 the vast majority of people who get credentials wont have to volunteer
4708847 the folks who might have accidentally hit the volunteer tab they dont have to worry theyre in the same place in line
4708848 now its pure principle i was a hillary clinton supporter and this is literally my first touch with the obama campaign and its just disappointing
4708849 below the sanctuary in the fellowship hall a banner for slavery reparations proclaimed they owe us
4708850 like wright daughtry is in your face about her activism
4708851 that s why i work in politics my family were activists
4708852 some would say with marxist momma in the top job its little wonder why barack obama is the dncs golden boy coming to denver with mainstream media garnered rock star status
4708853 at the basis of black liberation theology is the understanding that god has a special place in his heart for those at the bottom of the ladder
4708854 this election is like death for life on this planet as we know it
4708855 i preside over the greatest collection of integrity and idealism
4708856 i m trying to save the planet i m trying to save the planet
4708857 this election is like death for life on this planet as we know it
4708858 theres no doubt that when it comes to our treatment of native americans as well as other persons of color in this country weve got some very sad and difficult things to account for
4708859 i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged
4708860 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
4708861 she indicated such a vote would have to be part of a larger package that included other policies like releasing oil from the strategic petroleum reserve which she said could bring down prices in a matter of days
4708862 i cannot see us accepting this french draft vitaly churkin told reporters referring to a french drafted text agreed by western ambassadors
4708863 the georgians must agree to sign agreements on the non use of force with the ossetians and with the abkhazians
4708864 europeans and americans including very senior officials in the bush administration blame the west for pushing russia too hard on too many issues
4708865 they woke up this weekend and figured out that that ad resonated and they needed to do something about it
4708866 if the celebrity issue were not hurting them they would have ignored it
4708867 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
4708868 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
4708869 today news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4708870 my whole house shook the front door came off and i saw fire
4708871 next thing you know ive got glass in my head and im running down the road

4708873 i have some news thats going to anger you its going to chill you as you know brave republicans in the house are continuing their battle to force nancy pelosi to bring the democrats back to have an up or down vote expanding the opportunity to drill for oil in anwr and offshore they continue to make their points and they continue to fight this is an issue as you know as i have mentioned it to you its the issue that can change this entire campaign around americans are angry and its not just at the price of oil and gasoline it is the related price increases everything that happens as a result of that food has gone up practically everything has gone up airline transportation everythings gone up because of the price of oil the oil is coming down but its a market thats still fluid and nobody can predict whats going to happen and whether the price continues to come down or not weve gotten a warning here we need to do what we can to expand our own supply and the republicans in the house are doing everything they can to see to it that this happens
4708874 however in the senate there is a new bipartisan coalition called the gang of ten five democrats five republicans led by senator lindsey graham on the republican side
4708875 theyre doing all of this while these brave republicans in the house are fighting the odds in their own revolution trying to stop pelosi and force her back so that we can move forward on a bill that would expand drilling five republican senators join five democrats and basically hand the democrats everything they want
4708876 weve got a bunch of republicans who have been trained by the presidential nominee of their party that the way to advance yourself with the media and in washington social circles is to agree with democrats this is just mind boggling well keep you posted on any further developments
4708877 if i am for freedom why should i give away anything not saying this is freedom versus tyranny but gosh folks if this keeps up were going to have tyranny well i think we do in terms of property rights and any number of things so heres a bipartisan effort that mccain didnt support this one included drilling limitations on drilling and mccain wants to open up drilling its become his issue and these five republican senators last friday just nuked it at least in the senate
4708878 now this deal by the way this gang of ten deal get this
4708879 it would put up more barriers to drilling which is what the democrats want because they want no drilling period five republicans go along with it
4708880 yeah this did catch mccain by surprise because it put him in a very ironic situation
4708881 im not for tax increases and there are too many tax increases in this bill thats not the way
4708882 i left off the most important thing to look at
4708883 folks i cant explain it you can make up whatever explanation you want theyre stupid they want good coverage in the media whatever it is
4708884 the basic outline of the government we posses and our civic religion as a people is such that potentially at least we could create a society that is a model for the world it isnt right now
4708885 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
4708886 we deplore the russian military action in georgia which is a violation of georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity
4708887 the deputy secretary said that we deplore todays russian attacks by strategic bombers and missiles which are threatening civilian lives
4708888 these attacks mark a dangerous and disproportionate escalation of tension
4708889 when you consume the least fuel its obvious they wont like you in the oil emirates
4708890 able to independently discern the name maya kassandra soetoro from artifacts left behind in the process of forging a new fake document for barack from an image of mayas original document
4708891 take responsibility to verify the eligibility of mr barack h obama to be president of the united states
4708892 mr obama has refused to produce a physical certified stamped copy of his birth certificate an electronically displayed imaged displayed by his official campaign website has alleged to have been a forgery we request that the fec require mr obama to authorize the fec to obtain an official copy of his birth certificate
4708893 i am looking for 50 brave men or women from 49 states and the district of columbia to join me in suing the secretaries of state in our respective states to prevent them from posting the name barak h obama on the november 2008 ballot until he presents incontrovertible proof that he is a u s citizen
4708894 the secretaries of state are the ones who by placing a person or initiative on the ballot certify that the candidates or initiatives meet the legal requirements to be on the ballot
4708895 the office of the president is simply too important to trust to someone other than a person whose loyalties are 100 percent american and while it is impossible to read into the heart of a man or woman we do have the test our forefathers gave us which is this office is not to be entrusted to anyone but a natural u s citizen
4708896 the revelation that the birth certificate of obamas own sister was evidently used to create the electronic forgery represents what supporters of this analysis claim is a smoking gun that appears to implicate sen
4708897 there have been reports so far unconfirmed that obama was born outside the country either in kenya his presumed fathers native land or in canada the fact that the obama campaign has been touting as genuine a forgery since june 12 will likely increase pressure to not only account for the fake but produce a genuine paper birth certificate obama in his book dreams from my father specifically mentioned having such a document in his possession but it has not been submitted for public inspection or analysis if it in fact exists
4708898 if obama were born outside the united states one could argue that he would not meet the legal definition of natural born citizen because u
4708899 so she wouldnt have met the requirement of five years after the age of 16
4708900 natural born citizen under article ii section 1 of the constitution of the united states
4708901 no person except a natural born citizen shall be eligible to the office of president
4708902 in his first race for office seeking a state senate seat on chicagos gritty south side in 1996 obama effectively used election rules to eliminate his democratic competition
4708903 through the course of our lives we are fortunate enough to receive a multitude of amazing gifts gifts which though through another s hard won sacrifice we freely call our own the majority of the time we fail to express our gratitude to these selfless heroes and it is for that reason that generations of men and women serving our armed forces go unnoticed yet these men and women have given life limb and all the creature comforts of home to ensure that liberty and all its freedoms should never fail for you for me
4708904 my name is keela carr and i am an american a proud daughter of my fore fathers a grateful recipient of the precious gift of freedom
4708905 i dont think you can overstate the importance that the rise of islamic fundamentalism will have to the rest of the world in the century ahead especially if as seems possible its most fanatical elements get their hands on nuclear and chemical weapons and the means to deliver them against their enemies

4708911 its an ignorant statement because if we judge people by how big they are or how they ran in the combine or whatever the case may be this nfl wouldnt be what it is today
4708912 its really about guys who want to play the game of football no matter what the situation is and im one of those guys
4708913 we just keep pushing what were doing in practice we had three really physical days now you want to see guys that can take that physical ness and those details and put it into a preseason game
4708914 but it definitely has helped me become a better person and a better player sometimes you need those things
4708915 people who actually know football know you dont have to be 6 5 to play in the tampa two defense
4708916 its all about knowing what youre doing knowing the game of football and playing ball you dont have to get 20 yards deeper in coverage because youre not 6 3 thats not how things work
4708917 not at all you need it itll push you to be the best you can be but i just go do what i do
4708918 we all know those foreigners dont wash themselves after shitting they just wipe their arses with toilet roll such things are not acceptable in a closely knit society as ours
4708919 what is the use of hiring foreigners when we have capable political strategists like kalbe and kurendhoo mahir we shouldnt let even a bodu laari go overseas in a time of economic recession only last month we celebrated independence day now anni wants to take us backwards to british colonial rule
4708920 as we speak hes earned a spot in the rotation
4708921 galarraga probably improved more than any pitcher we have because he learned how to hold runners he learned how to be deceptive he learned how to change his cadence to home
4708922 a lot of organizations would have just let him battle through it but they did not want him to get to a point of no return
4708923 they did their best to get him into a pressure free environment where he could get a lot of specialized attention
4708924 i think hes going to be great for detroit i think he will have two great seasons in a row
4708925 dad what kind of offense are the lions going to run this year
4708926 now if you have a mediocre offensive line you let t j duckett go plan to give the ball to tatum bell who is small or a rookie in kevin smith and have spent four top first round draft picks on receivers including two of the best young ones in roy williams and calvin johnson would you go to a power running game
4708927 we put together a foundation to have a great year and to be the no 1 defense in the league now its about execution

4708939 im not looking for any new job im running for re election
4708940 if i was bi lingual id say no in multiple languages the only job john kerry is running for contemplating or considering is the one he already has
4708941 the vice presidential nominee will address the convention on wednesday night august 27 and the
4708942 heard that kerry was being vetted by the obama team
4708943 he ran for president i think he would be a strong choice hed be a good choice especially in the context of foreign policy
4708944 the spokesman for whoever presumptive democratic nominee sen barack obama d ill taps as his running mate
4708945 the whole way everything went down in dallas with me i didnt really leave there on the note i wanted to leave
4708946 and there are just some things that ill never forget that happened to me there and im going to play like that and theyre going to be able to tell and you guys will be able to tell too
4708947 hes a pretty compact package and he brings it every down his vision jumps out at you a little more especially when youre watching the practice cut ups films
4708948 you can tell hes got a little attitude with him and you like that
4708949 i kind of know what im asking mo morris and julius to do
4708950 in this day and age you want to be the man you know and im going to play both of them itll certainly help our football team if i can keep them both fresh and somewhat healthy through the course of the season by doing it this way
4708951 not in a bad way but people will take their summer vacation to come watch the cowboys do training camp if that tells you anything here you might get a couple families coming to watch practice but here you get to know your teammates really well theres no outside distractions or anything like that it seems to work really well for me
4708952 i feel like a rookie again you know what i mean
4708953 i feel like i have something to prove every day out here i play with a chip on my shoulder i run hard i block hard i practice hard im performing as if no ones ever seen me play before
4708954 i think this is the one time where age is helping me
4708955 i think this is where just life has helped just life experiences being a mom now and trying to juggle and do different things its really fun now i really love what im doing i love competing
4708956 and the opportunity to come out here to represent my country and my family and now my son it is different from the other olympics for me age and experience has helped me more than anything else i mean eventually you have to get it right right
4708957 i think ill sleep a little better tonight than i did last night now that this hurdle is over
4708958 i accept that role and responsibility and ive got to come out here and keep cheering everybody on and supporting the rest of team usa
4708959 its a great honor to be the team captain that means a lot of people think really highly of me as a person not just an athlete
4708960 its one of those things where its so hard just to make it here and just to be here and compete here were all champions
4708961 if you look at the olympic spirit and the olympic creed its about the struggle and the fight and the journey and thats whats beautiful about being here this is a journey and i love it and thats why im still doing it
4708962 undecided want to see who is most likely to give the people the best deal i will make my deicision on decision day i am closely watching anni hassan and maumoon it is likely to be one of them unless gasim can convince he will serve the greater public good
4708963 i guess ill take the silver it was a hard day for everybody
4708964 were so dominant to come in here and get spanked like this it makes you reflect we have a lot of work to do
4708965 in pool play you can afford to have one loss maybe
4708966 they went about it and didnt worry about being on tv
4708967 i dont think it wont be for another five 10 or 15 years when they realize how special this is thats ok we just want to keep the mindset that its another game and go about our business everything in their mind will be its just another game
4708968 no i really wouldnt like to hear about jills messy breakup because i dont know jill so i dont really care
4708969 i am fine thank you and enjoying my house in palm beach
4708970 it was there from the first lap the first turn
4708971 we tried some things during practice that didnt work at all so we went back to where we were and i think thats one of the best qualifying cars ive ever had it was a heck of a lap sometimes you just hit it you dont know why
4708972 both hate to lose and dont back away from anybody or anything
4708973 i was chasing someone named don schollander and jesse owens who had four gold medals and when i came up with a program for seven gold medals it came to be almost ridiculously invented by myself
4708974 it is quite difficult to imagine that one of his competitors is going to think that on any given day that it is going to be his day
4708975 even in light of the fact you not only do your best time and break his old world record you are still looking at his feet i think that is a little demoralizing
4708976 i want to be a juvenile p o probation officer as soon as i graduate growing up living in compton and seeing a lot of misdirected kids a lot of violence i want to change that i also look up to my aunt and she was a juvenile p o and she got me started at a young age i went to work with her a few times and liked what she did
4708977 i would say one of my hobbies would be playing the nintendo wii i got addicted to that due to my roommate linebacker chris stevens he turned me on to that one day and we played nonstop
4708978 i played defensive end in high school so it wasnt like a new position linebacker was kind of tough because i came in and got thrown in and i really didnt know the basics what it took to be a linebacker i thought it was just follow the ball when i switched back to defensive end after freshman season i felt more comfortable
4708979 i hope monday of game week hes ready to go just for the timing purposes with the receivers
4708980 hes throwing the ball right now but he needs game week he needs to be able to get in there with the first receiving group whoever that is going to be and make sure the timing stuff is down
4708981 hes just a warrior out there watching him thursday running the stadium stairs the hash and foot drills strengthening that thing hes a machine on all that stuff then he comes in and throws seven on seven so who knows when hes going to heal up but nobody is working harder at it than he is thats the positive thing seeing him out there working
4708982 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4708983 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4708984 the concept had been on the table for some years now all countries have finally agreed on the formation and implementation of the saarc food bank
4708985 i knew i was in the race at the turn but i knew that this could happen
4708986 i never really race for a medal i usually just race for my personal best so im just racing myself in a lot of ways and im really happy with silver
4708987 ive had a couple of plateaus in my life i think everyone goes through them if theyre in the sport long enough
4708988 i think some of it for me is just getting a little bit older
4708989 when you get more mature your priorities kind of become a little more apparent and you realize that there is more to life than just swimming
4708990 i joke around sometimes and tell people i dont know if im really maturing or going in the opposite direction sometimes i feel like im turning back into an 8 year old i think you have to feel that way when youve been into the sport a long time like i have youre going to have peaks and valleys everyone has plateaus everyone loves the sport one minute then hates it the next
4708991 i think she went through a period when i wouldnt say she was bored but she just had a lull
4708992 now shes rediscovered her passion for it shes really gotten back into loving it again
4708993 i got into a little bit of a mental rut and with some new training ideas and a few stroke changes sean was able to bring that 8 year old out in me again
4708994 im probably at a point where im not going to be doing this a lot longer and i want to enjoy what i have left of it when i get to that point not yet i want to go out on a good note i think its just prioritizing
4708995 these are baseball decisions the shakeups got to come from the guys that are expected to perform melky cabrera batting ninth in our lineup is not supposed to be a difference maker in this club either way he was supposed to be able to slide right in while everybody else did their job
4708996 what we need is obviously the guys were counting on the guys that are making a significant amount of money that have significant performance levels to get the job done as expected and ill throw myself involved in that too i want to make sure im not pointing fingers were all in this thing together
4708997 that set him back 10 days and meant missing a couple of training sessions
4708998 he was bucking and playing on the hot walker the next morning so obviously it did not take that much out of him
4708999 honour the west is doing very well and is not to be overlooked
4709000 we had been here an hour in the village when they went here and got him
4709001 we are on the heels of those who try to cheat
4709002 there is an increased awareness in the sports population that doping is unacceptable
4709003 if the cat and mouse are quiet is the mouse in hiding or is the cat asleep
4709004 i can imagine that the temptation to abuse is lower than it was in the past
4709005 jamarcus took care of the ball im very pleased i just need to get over the end of the game
4709006 weve got more plays in our offense than what yall seen today
4709007 as this thing gets rolling the newness will wear off and it gets down to playing
4709008 i thought denver would be my last stop but things happened and here i am
4709009 i tried to be very concentrated on the game not to be more emotionally involved
4709010 ive been coaching with the u s team for the last four years this is not the first time weve played against china

4709026 it is a trust based on broadly shared civic and religiously based principles concern for our parents for our neighbors and for the legacy we will leave for our children and those who follow
4709027 we have been a team that has been under the bar a team that hadnt been able to get over the hump in major competitions and not been able to beat the european power
4709028 for me personally i felt today was the trademark of seven years of work with the program
4709029 the most important thing is we played well as a team
4709030 individual performances dont mean anything at an olympic games you can score 30 points a game but your team does not go through to the next round
4709031 today we executed what we were supposed to do we took russia out of what they wanted to do
4709032 nobody believes in us but us everyone is doubting us but we have nothing to lose
4709033 its an accomplishment to get through to the next round that was our goal at the pre olympics training camp held on the gold coast
4709034 were not letting teams execute the half court and that is the key for australia if we try to play a half court game against european teams well get hammered
4709035 we took a soft approach inside against those two teams and backed off
4709036 we talked about everything comes down to respect and i thought the defensive end of the floor today was key
4709037 we have been waiting for this opportunity since the last olympics
4709038 there are only so many games that come up like this and we were ready for it
4709039 a few times there were some little flare ups but it was all about things being intense
4709040 now we have a chance of miracle on ice or whatever you want to call it
4709041 hey laura ann what were you doing with that lamp
4709042 yea we met up last night talk about the situation amp made up
4709043 ich will nicht auf der modewelle fahren nach deren motto georgien goldig und russland b se ist
4709044 schon wieder wird eine stellvertreterdiskussion ber diese tragische situation gef hrt es ist in der tat eine tragische situation f r millionen menschen in der kaukasus region die opfer sind wie gew hnlich die normalen menschen und nicht die politiker die situation sehe ich aber nicht so wie sie in diesem zusammenhang meine vier amtskollegen die baltischen pr sidenten und der polnische pr sident bewertet haben

4709046 i ndia seems to be held together by chicken wire and chewing gum
4709047 the per capita income for those dependent on agriculture at 327 a year is only 22 per cent of that of the remaining half of the population at 1 490
4709048 and the gap would widen every year by almost 120 even if agriculture grew at the desired rate of 4 per cent and the economy at 8 per cent the gulf between india and bharat is real and fearsome
4709049 there is clearly something wrong with our employment policies and outcomes
4709050 darn i dont like small dogs do i get to throw myself off a cliff
4709051 twinkle twinkle little bat how i wonder where youre at
4709052 why sometimes ive believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast
4709053 never accept rides from strange men and remember that all men are strange
4709054 the reality is that there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off of a presidential campaign we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means necessary
4709055 the owner has completely lost control of the inside of his establishment and the police cant patrol the inside of the store

4709057 when the storm was at its highest there appeared as if descending directly from the sky a huge green mass then followed a peculiar patter unlike that of rain or hail when the storm abated the people found three inches deep and covering an area of more than four blocks a collection of a most striking variety of frogs so thick in some places that travel was impossible

4709066 out of a 100 point system we lost only 10 points
4709067 we also have a visible irrigation line that will be removed when all the plants are established
4709068 it is geeky to mention that but it makes the rail look more interesting
4709069 it can get chunky at the edges and it does not feel as polished as powder coated or blackened steel does
4709070 the leed h pilot program itself is evolving and such challenges mean they can update the ways in which they can rate a house for green qualities
4709071 instead of buying standard lumber that would have to be cut we had framing lumber precut to reduce waste on site
4709072 our proximity to town was really important to them because it gave us access to buses and parks
4709073 thanks to her i got a direct relationship with kitchenaid and whirlpool and we want to push the idea of more sustainable high end products
4709074 it is very difficult to say at this point whether after the olympics chinese society will become more open
4709075 there is always back and forth struggles between the authorities and the grass roots and citizens
4709076 theres still a lot of tension and the grass roots need to push their work forward
4709077 it has played a great role whether its about banning disposable chopsticks or sorting trash everyone at the mention of the olympics said they should do a better job
4709078 but since the olympics is already here the government had no choice but to move the agenda ahead
4709079 still has a long ways to go in engaging with civil society as true partners
4709080 i feel that for the disabled in china it cannot be called discrimination but unequal opportunities but for now it is improving and the pace will pick up because of the paralympics especially in job employment

4709083 there has been much in the press about beijings bad outdoor air pollution problems
4709084 but in reality the average person spends 90 of their time indoors it is indoor air that most affects our health while we cant do much about outdoor air we can take control of our indoor environments and make them healthy that is what we have done here with clean air apartment we have taken a normal apartment in the worlds most polluted city and turned it into one of the healthiest indoor environment that can be found anywhere in the world
4709085 we had to keep our project with athletes top secret for more than a year but now that the games have begun we can finally talk about it in all of the excitement of the competitions and people winning medals we didnt want to lose focus that what we are really about is creating healthy homes there are hundreds of millions of people around the world with severe allergies asthma other respiratory conditions and environmental sensitivities we are introducing to the world an innovative new kind of air cleaning technology that comprehensively removes indoor airborne irritants like dust mold pollen diesel soot allergens even bacteria and viruses at a level never before previously possible in homes clean air apartment gives us the opportunity to show people that this technology isnt just for helping athletes win medals its for improving your health and your families health in your home
4709086 we are data logging outdoor and indoor levels of airborne particles in terms of pm 10 pm 2 5 and pc 0 3
4709087 most of the government agencies have been reporting pm 10 levels in beijing but we think that is outdated pm 2 5 is a better and pc 0 3 is the best base measure of particulate air pollution most particles in pm 10 are relatively large particles so to speak sort of the rocks in the air but it is the submicron particles that are actually most dangerous to people these ultra fine particles are capable of penetrating lung tissue and entering the blood stream
4709088 when you consider that most air purifiers that people purchase at department stores improve you air quality by less than 5 in your home
4709089 we were very happy when we approached the 90 purity mark but then as the systems continued to clean already filtered air we rapidly saw the numbers go up a percentage point or two each day when we consistently reached 95 we were honestly able to say that we have better air here in our apartment in beijing than you have in the swiss alps
4709090 weve done many things over the last few years to try to demonstrate and educate people about what is really possible with good air cleaning
4709091 there are a lot of families out there with children with severe allergies and asthma and we are trying to raise awareness about an innovative new technology that can genuinely improve peoples lives
4709092 its amazing in this day and age that management is never asked to sacrifice
4709093 most of the members feel that the mbta should deal with the finan cial crisis that theyre facing right now then find a way to raise the salaries of executives
4709094 shouldnt be punished for being part of management and not being part of a union
4709095 you can go out side and have a fire at night and it does feel like camping
4709096 they want a sense of maybe being in the outdoors but not necessarily laying on the ground and dealing with all the critters and cooking over an open fire
4709097 you dont have to be a camper to experience camping
4709098 there is no need anymore to own a tent or sleep in a sleeping bag
4709099 we do all the set up and tear down and provide a guide
4709100 all the camp chores are taken care of by the chef
4709101 it affords people the maximum amount of time to enjoy the outdoors
4709102 they dont want to have to buy food and pack it all up and setting up the tents and drying the tents down when they get home you can go back home and your hands arent dirty and your back isnt sore
4709103 yesterday someone called from boston and asked if we deliver meals to the sites
4709104 if id said yes she was ready to sign up for the meal plan
4709105 it is not camping but its basically saying you can kind of experience the idea of camping but not get dirty at all
4709106 i dont like bugs so its perfect because if you want to be outside you can be its kind of rustic in a nonrustic kind of way without having to cook your own meals
4709107 even when you go for your massage there is that outdoor kind of feeling to it there are a lot of windows in the spa
4709108 as we see their numbers go up we want to be sure they are diverse economically
4709109 its a very difficult discussion because we also want to maintain a certain level of access for domestic students
4709110 by default it gives you this very welcoming atmosphere to have all these people from different countries going through the same experiences as you
4709111 if we want to sustain this level of international students over time
4709112 we have to take a look at how it feels on campus this year
4709113 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately

4709115 there can be no negotiated capitulations and negotiated dismemberment of smaller countries by bigger ones
4709116 the entire responsibility for the conflict for the cruel actions committed rests upon the shoulders of the georgian leadership

4709118 also wie es zu der sommer revue selber kam das wei ich ehrlich gesagt auch nicht so richtig da gibt es verschiedene varianten von geschichten auf alle f lle haben die mich angerufen und haben gesagt wir h tten dich gerne dabei und da ich dieses haus sehr sehr mag sehr sch tze hab ich gesagt sofort und ja und wann ich bin da
4709119 dann wenn man die reaktion h rt dann ist man nat rlich gl cklich da kann man so alt werden wie man will der ehrgeiz bleibt und wenn es dann auch noch einigerma en gelungen ist froh bin ich
4709120 ganz ehrlich es erinnert mich ein bisschen an meine kindheit da ich selbst hier im friedrichstadtpalast auch schon aufgetreten bin als kind hinzu kommt noch dass ich gesichter sehe im ballett die ich pers nlich kenne die in meiner staatlichen ballettschule mitgetanzt haben und ja das sch ne ist es ist ja eine sommerliche revue es ist musik deutsche musik die ich also selbst auch kenne und sehr sch tze und eine revue mit viel glitzer und glamour so wie es sich geh rt

4709122 die problematik die wir heute in deutschland haben ist zum einen mal verunsicherung dass leute nicht wissen was sie kaufen sollen einfach weil auch die politik keine eindeutige aussage macht und zum anderen mal nat rlich auch das vorhandene geld es ist alles teurer geworden und am ende berlegen viele leute ob sie ihr altes auto noch ein paar jahre behalten ich glaube dass das das eigentliche problem ist das problem ist nicht dass die leute kein interesse mehr am automobil haben

4709128 in no way is the us presidents plan for missile defence aimed at russia
4709129 the purpose of missile defence is to protect our european allies from any rogue threats

4709216 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4709217 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4709218 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4709219 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4709220 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4709221 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4709222 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4709223 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4709224 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4709225 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4709226 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4709227 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4709228 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4709229 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4709230 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4709231 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

4709233 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4709234 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4709235 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4709236 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4709237 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4709238 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

4709252 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4709253 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4709254 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4709255 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4709256 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4709257 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4709258 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4709259 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4709260 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4709263 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4709264 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4709265 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4709266 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4709267 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4709268 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4709269 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4709270 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4709271 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4709272 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4709273 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4709274 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4709275 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4709276 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4709277 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4709278 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4709279 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4709280 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4709281 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4709282 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4709283 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4709284 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4709285 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4709286 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4709287 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4709288 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4709289 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4709290 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4709291 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4709292 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4709293 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4709294 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4709295 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4709296 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4709297 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4709298 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4709299 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4709300 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4709301 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4709302 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4709303 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4709304 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4709305 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4709306 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4709307 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4709308 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4709309 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4709310 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4709311 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4709312 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4709313 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4709314 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4709315 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4709316 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4709317 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4709318 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4709319 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4709320 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4709321 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4709322 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4709323 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4709324 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4709325 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4709326 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4709327 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4709328 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4709329 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4709330 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4709331 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4709332 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4709333 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4709334 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4709335 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4709336 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4709337 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4709338 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4709339 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4709340 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4709341 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4709342 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial

4709344 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
4709345 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
4709346 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
4709347 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
4709348 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
4709349 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
4709350 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
4709351 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
4709352 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
4709353 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
4709354 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
4709355 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
4709356 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
4709357 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
4709358 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
4709359 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
4709360 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
4709361 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
4709362 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
4709363 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
4709364 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
4709365 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
4709366 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
4709367 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
4709368 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
4709369 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
4709370 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
4709371 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
4709372 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
4709373 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
4709374 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
4709375 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
4709376 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
4709377 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
4709378 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
4709379 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
4709380 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
4709381 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
4709382 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
4709383 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
4709384 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
4709385 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
4709386 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
4709387 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
4709388 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
4709389 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
4709390 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
4709391 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
4709392 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
4709393 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
4709394 try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value
4709395 by signing mike brown and pitbull to sponsorship contracts we are supporting the fighters their att team and the sport of mma in south florida
4709396 mixed martial arts has been steadily gaining popularity but has never received more attention than it does today and by having pitbull and mike brown represent champion they will help us bring the champion nutrition brand to more mma fans
4709397 daarvoor zag ik mezelf als iemand die tussen de vijfde en zesde plaats thuis hoorde maar door het wk is dat veranderd daarom is het voor mij een realistisch doel om hier in peking voor het goud te gaan
4709398 ive never opened myself in this way life is ours we live it our way all these words i dont just say
4709399 all the times that ive cried all this wasted its all inside and i feel all this pain stuffed it down its back again
4709400 must be preceded by a passive affirmative nonchallenging attitude toward change among the mass of our people they must feel so frustrated so defeated so lost so futureless in the prevailing system that they are willing to let go of the past and change the future
4709401 a liberal is someone who puts his foot down firmly on thin air
4709402 america was built by its radicals the hope and future of america lies with its radicals
4709403 this is the job for todays radical to fan the embers of hopelessness into a flame to fight
4709404 from militant indians to chicanos to puerto ricans to blacks from all parts of the black power spectrum from panthers to radical philosophers from a variety of campus activists s d s and others to a priest who was joining a revolutionary party in south america
4709405 and their arrogance is the major threat to our future as a free society
4709406 the best education i ever had and where i learned the true meaning of my christian faith
4709407 camouflage is key to alinsky style organizing in organizing coalitions of black churches in chicago obama caught flak for not attending church himself he became an instant churchgoer
4709408 ethical standards must be elastic to stretch with the times
4709409 all values are relative in a world of political relativity
4709410 an over the shoulder acknowledgment to the very first radical who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom lucifer
4709411 a beam of light will come down upon you you will experience an epiphany and you will suddenly realize that you must go to the polls and vote for obama
4709412 anyone who is working against the haves is always facing odds and in many cases heavy odds if he or she does not have that complete self confidence or call it ego that he can win then the battle is lost before it is even begun
4709413 ego must be so all pervading that the personality of the organizer is contagious that it converts the people from despair to defiance creating a mass ego
4709414 it is the schizophrenia of a free society that we outwardly espouse faith in the people but inwardly have strong doubts whether the people can be trusted
4709415 turn to an extreme chauvinism and become defenders of the american faith
4709416 activists and radicals on and off our college campuses people who are committed to change must make a complete turnabout
4709417 our rebels have contemptuously rejected the values and way of life of the middle class they have stigmatized it as materialistic decadent bourgeois degenerate imperialistic war mongering brutalized and corrupt
4709418 the power and the people are in the big middle class majority
4709419 transnational kidnappings are a new way of operating for these criminal groups mainly in california and so we are seeking collaboration with the united states
4709420 the break up of the arellano felix organization has not been as complete as we would have wished
4709421 joy for anyone interested in pop culture of the past 40 years
4709422 experimental camera work and editing makes for a fittingly unconventional portrait of one of the pioneers of punk music

4709424 with the other fixed prices of the range except blocked fixed prices and without engagement the iphone 8go will be marketed starting from 199 euros
4709425 a valid offer of refunding of 100 euros until the 10 31 2008
4709426 there is a big myth that it is impossible to get into google
4709427 i worked for cisco for six years before this it was also an amazing company but people there just didnt feel the joy like we do here
4709428 it is borderline stepford wives for the it industry you wonder is there really no conflict are there no politics at all
4709429 in terms of the beanbags and colour i dont really pay attention to them any more it is more what is behind them the non hierarchical culture where people feel relaxed i like the free atmosphere of universities but i want the excitement of doing something in the real world
4709430 escusado ser dizer que as mulheres brasileiras contam se entre as mais quentes do planeta
4709431 por outras palavras os portugueses devem ter percebido que o lugar era muito prop cio a gerar mulheres muito belas
4709432 o brasil tem o maior pib de toda a am rica latina com sectores agr colas e industriais significativos e uma enorme reserva de trabalho faz assim algum sentido que com a economia a ir t o bem os cidad os brasileiros estejam menos stressados e tenham mais tempo para cuidar de si mais f cil comer direito praticar exerc cio f sico e utilizar cuidados e produtos de pele do que quando o seu pa s tinha quadrilh es de d lares de d vida externa
4709433 claro os eua poderiam nukear para o esquecimento com o nosso stock massi o de superarmas mas isso implicaria literalmente matar as mais belas mulheres do planeta
4709434 we are at the early stages of this inquiry but we believe there may have been witnesses who could assist our investigation into finding out what happened
4709435 there was quite a bit of violence at the pool on the arab residents part and we had to figure out what to do
4709436 its a city pool and we want people to come here with their children have a good time and enjoy some peace and quiet it got to the point where violence was the order of the day and police presence at the pool was a common sight
4709437 several of the residents decided to come together and carry out a symbolic gesture so that the jewish families could enjoy themselves in a relaxed atmosphere
4709438 i hate to say this i wish the arab residents could join us and enjoy the pool with us while keeping the peace but thats just not happening theyre looking to cause trouble and thats a shame
4709439 none whatsoever they have the rest of the week for themselves to use the pool they show up whenever they want we are the ones who dont show up because of the violence
4709440 the problem of violence can be solved by instating a general overreach program not by implementing a limited one
4709441 leaving is not an option last year i asked internal security minister avi dichter to include jaffa in the city without violence project and he said that tel aviv jaffa does not meet the programs criteria
4709442 i am shocked and appalled this is outright racism to decide to deny arabs entry because theyre bad we cant accept people thinking that any official involved in making this decision should resign
4709443 the police should look into those matters and set things right but it cant affect the pool
4709444 how bad would aaron make fun of me for going on tour with this dude
4709445 hed probably tell you to suck it up and quit being a wimp
4709446 taken away an opportunity for exposure for an american band
4709447 i really have to go i have to turn in my column tonight
4709448 well what about the rest of you if youre cool should you not want to warm more than just your wrist
4709449 those who matter don mind and those who mind dont matter
4709450 it is good for a man to eat thistles and to remember that he is an ass but the artichoke is the best of thistles and the man who enjoys it has the satisfaction of feeling that he is an ass of taste

4709458 ive coddled you for so long an egg will give me no trouble
4709459 the prime culinary production of a village ed hollywood that goes in grimly for productions is the caesar salad a vast garlic ridden thing that is consumed by the bale before the meal is lugged in
4709460 johnny meyer ed at one point howard hughes press agent still slathers the dough around he phoned from a party at acapulco mexico on the far west coast to ask billy reed at new yorks little club his recipe for caesar salad
4709461 rich guy jumps off cliff into the roaring sea because of a broken heart
4709462 i am an illiterate that has to rely on my wife for all of the assistance that i can get
4709463 i work for company x therefore company x is my employer and i am his employee
4709464 i guess im going to have to sue my employer
4709465 that was it this is what i was meant to do
4709466 i just cant take it that much longer this muddy stench is getting stronger
4709467 with the shoes he doesnt own with a coat thats barely sewn left to dangle in the breeze left alone at night to freeze
4709468 when i write a song or do a song i have to actually ask myself is this a song i could have heard somebody like muddy waters doing or someone like walter horton or someone like lazy lester doing
4709469 rippin bluesy rock and fusion high on energy with good old fashioned song craft
4709470 you gotta give it up you gotta put it down
4709471 one of the best chicago blues lps of the 1980s eddy has gone on to make about 15 records on several different labels including cleartone a label he once owned eddy clearwater is now on the prestigious alligator records this is his first cd by them
4709472 too old to get married to young to get buried
4709473 this is the most important song bob dylan has written since
4709474 how is dave mason going to top this hes doing one big hit after another
4709475 the spirit of liberty the men and women of the armed forces of the united states of america and to the patriots of this country who are the hope of freedom
4709476 what would so and so do if they were in this situation
4709477 i finally get it they see you when they see me i will stay as long as you need me
4709478 so what are the differences between chinese and american gymnasts
4709479 yeah she does look like a little kid know why
4709480 its a killer watching that i mean theyre just kids as a parent this is why some people just raise chinchillas
4709481 and then in a moment of inspiration i ran all the way home
4709482 when we found out that we only had a few weeks with him we tried to do absolutely everything with him that we could him and ellie had been special friends for a couple of years but then they broke up we said wed have a pirate party and ellie came she went to visit reece a few times in hospital as well
4709483 he was so proud of her and we were proud of them both
4709484 003 rory gallaghers spirit is alive and well in barry mc cabe
4709485 sudah selayaknya dan suatu kewajiban kita sebagai umat islam untuk mengimani dan menjadikan alquran sebagai pedoman hidup kita
4709486 i would not be surprised if some ethnic minorities in china were offended by this but they are also accustomed to it
4709487 in the west we are obsessed with authenticity in such matters but its different in china id guess many chinese would not have a problem with it
4709488 i see nothing wrong exactly with where the children are from it is a tradition in china in terms of giving a performance
4709489 i think the fear for many is does harmony and unity ultimately mean assimilation and surrendering their own identity and autonomy
4709490 religion is regarded by the common people as true by the wise as false and by the rulers as useful
4709491 if you want to do evil science provides the most powerful weapons to do evil but equally if you want to do good science puts into your hands the most powerful tools to do so
4709492 it is the inevitable effect of religion on public policy that makes it a matter of public concern
4709493 with so many mindbytes to be downloaded so many mental codons to be replicated it is no wonder that child brains are gullible open to almost any suggestion vulnerable to subversion easy prey to moonies scientologists and nuns
4709494 and go about the city in the streets and in the squares i will seek the one i love
4709495 erfolg besteht darin dass man genau die f higkeiten hat die im moment gefragt sind

4709497 the fact that 10 member unions have signalled their intention to tender for the 2015 and 2019 tournaments reflects the growing global prestige of the rugby world cup
4709498 five of the six irb regions are represented with italy jamaica and russia signalling an interest to tender for a rugby world cup for the first time such a response highlights the growing development and popularity of rugby across the world
4709499 the strong response also justifies the irbs move to award two tournaments at the same time
4709500 ser a f cil presa de los lobos de mar
4709501 puedo mirar a los ojos a cualquiera de los que estamos aqu y a muchos que les falta venirse aludi a quienes apoyan la creaci n del sindicato estatal de trabajadores de la educaci n promovido por su adversario h ctor manuel lara moreno quien fue suspendido en sus derechos en la secci n 37 y enfrenta una demanda por malversaci n de los dineros a su cargo en el fondo mutualista de retiro podemos saludarlos con atenci n con respeto con dignidad
4709502 ahora estamos atravesando por una crisis que vamos remendando poco a poco me da mucho gusto que en esta reuni n que fortalecemos a trav s de nuestro delegado especial nos encontremos con compa eros muy valiosos como juan miguel villalobos hilda pacheco le n mar a luisa guti rrez santoyo rodolfo l pez huerta los coordinadores regionales de otras regiones y que estemos haciendo un trabajo combativo con un mismo objetivo construir al fin y al cabo aqu nos podemos poner de acuerdo pero atr s de nosotros est un gran compromiso los compa eros en las escuelas
4709503 una crisis que claro que nos duele se aprende con el ejemplo el ejemplo que nuestros padres nos dan con su trabajo entrega y dedicaci n a todo lo que hacen el trabajo que nuestros maestros nos encomendaron
4709504 c mo nos hacen falta los valores la comunicaci n la verdad la dedicaci n la sinceridad esa es la gran tarea y el gran reto que tenemos no tan s lo lo sindical y buscar posiciones que es hermoso servir al sindicato pero tambi n tenemos un gran reto que es educar
4709505 por eso voltean todav a los padres de familia a vernos con respeto pero no defraudemos esa esperanza que a n hay en que los maestros construyamos una educaci n para servir a una sociedad
4709506 vamos dando el paso y pong monos de acuerdo para contrarrestar lo que tanta falta nos hace la unidad en la secci n 37
4709507 como bien lo dijo el delegado especial aqu cabemos todos el que entienda ese mensaje vamos poni ndonos de acuerdo si aqu va a estar el delegado que bueno con su orientaci n y si no va a ser que bueno que nos podamos poner de acuerdo m s adelante
4709508 en ese trabajo en la responsabilidad que cada uno tiene en lo laboral social econ mico que finalmente todo repercute en lo pol tico tenemos una tarea que hacer si no entregamos todo nuestro potencial y el extra que nos quede esta secci n va a seguir as dormida
4709509 hay cosas que el tiempo juzgar dimensionar y pondr a cada quien en su lugar pero hay cosas que no podemos olvidar tenemos que hacer el esfuerzo de seguir caminando sin perder los objetivos servir a la educaci n y a la sociedad
4709510 los que coincidan con este ideal y quieran dar toda su fuerza de voluntad para sacar adelante a la secci n 37 que bueno que coincidamos en ese principio
4709511 mr kangarloo to be perfectly honest with you hasnt been communicating satisfactorily with us
4709512 it is very difficult to say at this point whether after the olympics chinese society will become more open
4709513 there is always back and forth struggles between the authorities and the grass roots and citizens
4709514 theres still a lot of tension and the grass roots need to push their work forward
4709515 it has played a great role whether its about banning disposable chopsticks or sorting trash everyone at the mention of the olympics said they should do a better job
4709516 but since the olympics is already here the government had no choice but to move the agenda ahead
4709517 still has a long ways to go in engaging with civil society as true partners
4709518 i feel that for the disabled in china it cannot be called discrimination but unequal opportunities but for now it is improving and the pace will pick up because of the paralympics especially in job employment
4709519 having betrayer pieces selected parce que the couloir midnight speaking of the kermis is an beguiling honour oneself matins in like manner felicific upon the picnic and its programmers and organizers who enjoy supported my influence ex the actually beat and shadem okay overexcited en route to connive at this scoresheet exactly showcased passage this force of habit

4709523 i believe the people of wyoming are going to vote for john mccain
4709524 as the governor of wyoming says dont bet the ranch on it
4709525 she died on her own we did give her a potent tranquilizer really quick so she would quit twitching but she wasnt feeling much pain when we got there
4709526 we just wanted to make sure she didnt get up and stomp on the jockey
4709527 he knew his name he knew what day it was but he also knew he was hurting
4709528 i saw when that horse went down and automatically when you see something like that you go to the outside
4709529 thats why you keep your head up no matter what all the way through a race you always look around you in front of you and pay attention
4709530 he took a pretty good blow in the fall so where he broke his arm its hard to say
4709531 it may have been when he landed but he got whacked again by the second horse
4709532 it started out to be kind of a smooth opening day
4709533 last year i did ok in billings but this year im going to do better i know i am ive got better stock
4709534 i wish it would have been a better storybook ending
4709535 i was excited to race not nervous out there there are a lot of sounds a lot of dirt and a lot of instantaneous action it takes you a minute to get back in the click of things
4709536 i like it when its boom boom boom i try to keep the same focus for each event when i back in the box i think its the national finals rodeo like im competing against the big guys
4709537 if you do well the momentum can carry over and if i do bad i just try to block it out and move on to the next one
4709538 team roping with your boyfriend is actually good for us
4709539 i know he will always be there sometimes i get mad at him when he misses and sometimes he gets mad at me when i miss but it helps because can rely on each other
4709540 how long can we stay mad sometimes it lasts 45 minutes sometimes a couple of days
4709541 ive been in a slump this summer and im trying to overcome it
4709542 ive just got to go out and do the best i can every time
4709543 im going to try and finish out the summer as strong as i can i want to go into the college season full bore with some momentum
4709544 ive never been to billings and im wandering down grand avenue as we speak
4709545 if someone does see something theyre not comfortable with or a license that is identifiable they can let us know about that
4709546 its really another way to integrate what we offer in google maps
4709547 we didnt even know there was such a thing as a coroners inquest because weve never dealt with anything like this
4709548 while i obviously cannot guarantee success i will commit to exploring the inclusion of both the one time 35 000 appropriation for the howitzer acquisition and the 3 500 ongoing costs for storage and maintenance by the wyoming national guard into my budget for this coming legislative session
4709549 but the key is to make repeating runs so im dialed in correctly
4709550 i had a hot rod back in high school and around 1988 i built my own car ive been racing on and off since
4709551 its great that mariah and thomas are getting the opportunity to race too if they want to work on their cars and continue racing they absolutely can
4709552 the whole family aspect has been great with this sport
4709553 were all out here every weekend together thats why if the kids want to bump up to another class well help them out
4709554 the camaraderie of the fellow racers out here is what keeps me in this sport
4709555 theres a group of us that are out here every weekend racing it becomes a really close bond with these guys
4709556 and the facility here is great ive raced from calgary to vegas all over and this is by far the nicest racing facility ive ever seen not only the track conditions but the facility as a whole
4709557 this is the weekend to see the top qualifying cars
4709558 its the fastest cars and the most cars of the season its the biggest bang for your buck to be out here
4709559 its great that you can come out here and mingle with the drivers
4709560 if you go to a lot of other drag strips you cant touch the cars or talk to the drivers i encourage people to come out and bring questions and get involved
4709561 my hope is that if you look at it a few years down the road we will be an innovative company in the provision of utility service
4709562 we will do it better more creatively more responsibly and provide real value to the communities in the state that we serve
4709563 what comes out of this case really does set the table for what we can do in the future for investment in new power plants or in existing power plants or contracts
4709564 there will always be a place for resources not owned by the company
4709565 part of what an executives job is is to help the management team throughout the organization do their job
4709566 i think i have some real skills to contribute there
4709567 after the beating we kind of took yesterday billings lost 13 3 to gillette wyo in the first round i was really proud of the way our kids came out today and fought against a good california team today
4709568 they ran two or three arms out there that were pretty good for us to stick that long for mike tevlin to hit that home run to put us ahead i would almost guarantee we were going to win the game
4709569 obviously it wasnt in the cards when they have their slowest guy on first base and he scores on a wacky play where the ball goes flying around
4709570 it was a great season i love all these guys tyler pitched a heck of a game he went out and threw strikes merced is a great ballclub
4709571 this is probably the last my start of my life
4709572 im planning on just going to school now i left everything i had on the field it was a close game and we just fell a little short
4709573 i thought tevlins home run sealed the deal but things didnt go our way tough loss
4709574 is it because theres talk now of really going out and exploring and finding more and using less
4709575 is it because people whove been doing manipulative speculation realize that the days are numbered
4709576 when you see that kind of drop off it shows that paying attention to the fact that americans are concerned has had potentially an impact on the cost
4709577 you have the high cost of energy impacting on peoples abilities to fill their truck pay their rent or mortgage and put food on the table so even though the state is doing very well there are issues affecting all the people in the state
4709578 the technology is there and the supply of coal is there and the wyoming legislature took a real lead with co2 capture legislation
4709579 right now coal is still the most affordable available secure source of energy
4709580 with any of these proposals i think if youre asking someone to make a major investment you need some certainty whether its renewable whether its wind whether its coal you want to make sure theres some certainty
4709581 we need it all we need all of the energy sources we need to be energy self sufficient as a nation
4709582 the ice plant is back now but it was smashed down and you could see the cougar tracks all the way down the hill
4709583 were now shipping from all of our distribution centers with full expectation that everybodys discs will go out today
4709584 hello everyone im listening in to your conversation so you better speak up
4709585 he started swimming at age seven partly because of the influence of his sisters and partly to provide him with an outlet for his restless energy he blossomed quickly as a swimmer and by the age of 10 held a national record for his age group more age group records followed and phelps rapid improvement culminated in his qualifying for the 2000 summer olympics at the age of 15
4709586 an estimated eight to 10 percent of all pro athletes have the condition as compared to four to five percent of the general population of adults
4709587 while some activities require intense concentration thats not always the case with athletics everything happens instantaneously youre in there for 10 minutes youve got five people trying to take your head off three referees four teammates you need to take in everything thats going on all at once thats how people with add go through life so it makes sense that they thrive in this field
4709588 when it feels as if a movie is about the audience and people are truly engaged with the story
4709589 this is the randy and jody part of my life
4709590 its a unique thing that randy and jody have a totally unique and independent energy
4709591 we have to show these families that we do remember their children died for our country
4709592 it helps so much when people remember him and honor his sacrifice
4709593 its like trying to put sardines in a can when the lids already on
4709594 weve been saying were a brewery but there hasnt been much proof of that until now
4709595 its a brew kettle mash tun with a separate lauter tun
4709596 its a pub system designed for small operations that allows us to make any style of beer we want
4709597 then we can go back to doing the things we do right
4709598 im a cowboy if i can get in the back of a chute i can ride its what pays the bills
4709599 most bulls when theyre done kind of turn away he stalled and when i got off he came right down on it
4709600 i picked three spot because i was jealous to see anybody else on him
4709601 three spot is a big bull and guys can get big rides from him and win a lot of money
4709602 if i was 100 percent healthy i would have picked soulja boy
4709603 because i know i have the talent to ride him
4709604 when you have family around there is good karma in this building
4709605 if it wasnt for the fans the sponsors we wouldnt have this
4709606 we would be sitting home in our rocking chairs to put people on their feet thats why we ride
4709607 permitted him to go to public school rather than attend school at casa pacifica where he would be safe
4709608 in fact everything we have indicates they did everything right in this case its an unfortunate circumstance but the school didnt fail to do anything
4709609 the outward appearance of cross dressing wearing makeup wearing girls clothing shoes etc
4709610 from what i saw of the allegations we dont agree with it
4709611 d mma upp om du g r och d mma upp om du inte g r
4709612 this isnt the war steed of more serious final fantasy games this chocobo is the most plush wide eyed merchandisable character in the ff universe and this game is clearly aimed at kids the town and character models look nice but dungeon and enemy designs are bland and lifeless in comparison sure this is the wii but square enix has accomplished much more on the playstation 2 the groundwork for a decent rpg is buried somewhere near the heart of chocobos dungeon but its the same baseline thats recycled in every mystery dungeon game players new to the formula may enjoy it for a while but the uninspired random levels quickly get monotonous even for first time dungeon crawlers final fantasy fans will find it to be below expectations and without any significant additions to the canon a relatively pointless play

4709616 then there is the broader television coverage and i also think there is more confidence in the corporate industry that the league is now more stable and sustainable than ever before
4709617 there is a realisation in corporate south africa that the world cup is not easy to get associated with and perhaps the only way to show involvement in the world cup and soccer is to get in on the local market
4709618 the fact that skys television coverage changed from eight to 16 cameras and that you had all this razzmatazz certainly brought about an improvement of the product
4709619 you do to some extent need smoke and mirrors in this business the sabc never really promoted the game they just turned up and showed the match
4709620 its amazing the kind of cash flow that has come into the game
4709621 i came from the period when you had to have a day job besides playing football
4709622 gone are the days when the first thing in many players mind was the pride of pulling on the jersey now players want the money first
4709623 the hunger to play the game at the highest level is missing in the early stages of my career you saw tackles flying in and pride in the way teams played in that sense the game has gone backwards
4709624 its no good just saying here is r20 million do what you like with it so much has to go into development into young players
4709625 that money is used for running the league as well as for prizemoney it is in our sponsorship of bafana that we have insisted a portion goes towards development
4709626 for us if we put our sponsorship into local football then the teams and players should benefit but i do hope we see a lot more of that money going into the future of football
4709627 i am involved in the extra money so i believe it is a good thing
4709628 but i think we are missing the boat at government level where they have to make sure more sports sponsorship goes into development you just have to look at the olympic results it is embarrassing
4709629 we keep pumping football money into the winners but i would also like to see more money going to schools to get more development going we cant have a national second division because apparently we have no money
4709630 i came in this morning with a blonde mane of hair i always wondered what i would look like dark i dont think i would necessarily have picked red hair
4709631 with modelling you have to be versatile and try different things if you cant then your portfolio isnt the best you need to be able to adapt it is just different obviously im not going to change my hair to go darker
4709632 we were like a married couple anyway we were together for seven years
4709633 i always go to the home games im looking forward to that

4709636 time moves so fast when ones in love but the pain is like a nail going through you head
4709637 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4709638 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4709639 they accepted the ruling because it was not the human eye making the judgment
4709640 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4709641 there is no doubt the question was for him to share or not to share first place there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps
4709642 in the old days the judges ruled now its the timers
4709643 technology is also imperfect the hand is quicker than the eye
4709644 they couldnt believe phelps got there and im sure ill feel the same way
4709645 there hasnt really been an error in the timing system that ive ever heard of the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first
4709646 im not about fighting it im not angry at all
4709647 we have got to be a little bit more unsporting or clever we dont encourage the players and i think its an english thing but our players are not used to going to ground i think if we would have twice they would have been big decisions for the referee
4709648 thats something we have got to learn over the course of the season if the players take on board what i have told them im sure well get that bit of luck we need sometimes
4709649 its not probably the right thing to do or say colchesters players have played at a level where they know 1 0 up away from home is a great result every free kick and goal kick is delayed
4709650 our players have got to learn a bit of that because sometimes we are a bit too eager and honest it can help at the end of the season by getting extra points or the next round of the cup
4709651 we have an extremely difficult game against luton who are fighting for their lives and on paper if you look at their squad it is very strong
4709652 i think thats the way they will approach it because if they dont then in 10 games time theyre going to have no chance if they put the performances in like leeds did last year and they claw it back then the remainder of the season could be very interesting for them so we expect a tough challenge
4709653 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4709654 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4709655 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4709656 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4709657 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4709658 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4709659 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4709670 it would be too trivial to put it simply down to what indigenous people term as rere or the informal synonym lamu it is deeper than that
4709671 i have observed indigenous males very closely on this aspect and i am ashamed at their general lack of knowledge integrity courage and leadership an appropriate phrase is taken from the islands of gau lailai na dina
4709672 worse when someone does speak up especially a woman they dont like it because they fear repercussions or it offends their ego

4709674 a weak economy is not a good thing for commodities
4709675 its a big positive for all the companies we invest in that use oil
4709676 commodities got way too high and consumer stocks in particular got too low
4709677 although worldwide inflationary pressures remain elevated some improvement is envisioned in the medium term given the recent decline in raw materials prices
4709678 people jump on the bandwagon and think these trends last forever but they dont
4709679 the thinking is that were ahead of the rest of the world in the economic cycle

4709709 appeals must be based on errors made by the trial judge
4709710 we conducted a careful analysis of the decision but we couldnt find any error in law and so we will not be proceeding
4709711 as far as im concerned the justice system definitely failed us
4709712 were trying to seek a lawyer to see what we can do

4709719 the formation of dead zones has been exacerbated by the increase in pollution fuelled by riverine run off of fertilizers and the burning of fossil fuels
4709720 from 1970 to 1990 the hypoxic zone on the northwestern continental shelf of the black sea has expanded to 40 000 square kilometres 15 500 square miles
4709721 however since 1989 the loss of fertilizer subsidies from the former soviet union reduced nutrient loading by a factor of two to four with the result that by 1995 the hypoxic zone had gone
4709722 climate change also has the potential to expand naturally occurring omzs oxygen minimum zones into shallower coastal waters damaging fisheries and affecting energy flows in the same way that eutrophication driven hypoxia does
4709723 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
4709724 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation
4709725 i would have thought the council would take more care
4709726 i cant believe no one at the town hall noticed
4709727 we accept that the wrong photo was used but the text and detail contained in the leaflet is wholly correct
4709728 we have managed to decant the liquid from one container to another to prevent it from spilling even more and it has just leaked onto the ground
4709729 our start is typically fast but what we did really really well today was the middle 1 000 metres we owned it
4709730 was just to stay on task and be as together as humanly possible just a mirror image of one another
4709731 i dont think the fact that australia didnt qualify changes much in terms of our approach
4709732 were going to go out there and race it as best we can

4709734 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4709741 everybodys amazed at china and seeing how fantastic china is
4709742 its blowing some people away totally a lot of people dont have any idea of what china is like if you go to new york city you will not find it any better or any different than this city here its bigger than new york city right now it probably has about 19 million people in it

4709749 on the weekends you can hardly move in my restaurant
4709750 id bet you out of that half million at least 80 to 90 per cent of those people have been one time or another in my restaurant
4709751 its the same as any other government theres always a little bit here a little bit there
4709752 they phoned me and they said look were sending you a plane ticket
4709753 when i first opened my restaurant i went into the kitchen for 16 months and trained my cooks myself
4709754 i jump in there on the line with them and cook and help them out whatever it takes

4709765 when people are displaced due to armed conflict they feel they are still not safe in their homes so as expected they would rather stay in evacuation sites
4709766 our assistance is not enough and we are aware of that
4709767 aside from food and medical assistance these people obviously need psychological intervention
4709768 at night we can still hear gunshots an indication the rebels are still there not far from baliki
4709769 we assure our people that the military will stay as long as the threats from moro rebels remain
4709770 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4709771 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak

4709774 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4709775 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4709776 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
4709777 it is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic
4709778 poland is an independent country and its an ally of the united states and its a democratic country to whose security the united states is committed

4709821 theres still a lot of tension and the grass roots need to push their work forward
4709822 it has played a great role whether its about banning disposable chopsticks or sorting trash everyone at the mention of the olympics said they should do a better job
4709823 but since the olympics is already here the government had no choice but to move the agenda ahead
4709824 still has a long ways to go in engaging with civil society as true partners
4709825 i feel that for the disabled in china it cannot be called discrimination but unequal opportunities but for now it is improving and the pace will pick up because of the paralympics especially in job employment
4709826 if it sounds to good to be true it probably is
4709827 the employer might not explain the reason for the firing so its difficult to get accurate statistics on how often it happens
4709828 in the u s we have moved into a knowledge economy and the main tool is your brain the best possible aid to that tool is a vacation
4709829 the company doesnt have to give the employees any extra time off and it allows office workers much more flexibility
4709830 ok so its not ideal but if you want time off its the easiest way
4709831 if you can afford to do it id recommend it unfortunately many employees think its a bit strange if they dont have their nose to the grindstone all the time especially if they are funding the vacation themselves
4709832 working the brains neurons by taking up a challenging activity will leave you far more refreshed than sitting at a resort doing nothing
4709833 i think they are more challenged today because of all the choice and the short window when they get the spotlight
4709834 youd almost say the olympics is an event beyond sports
4709835 the companies have to make sure that being associated with the olympics is going to help them ring their cash registers
4709836 if michael phelps swims for an eighth gold medal the tv ratings are going to be through the roof
4709837 if youre looking at the olympics in terms of these monster ratings and the stories that are coming out its a pretty attractive place to be
4709838 it is just what happens when you launch a new website
4709839 residents are feeling even more pain than suggested by the unemployment numbers
4709840 the entire nation continues to suffer through a slow economy that is affecting jobs and families here in california which is why i am working with legislators to include a needed economic stimulus package within our state budget
4709841 construction and financial services continue to struggle in california but i am encouraged about recent increases in housing purchases and that other job sectors while they do not have the robust growth we want or expect in california are holding steady
4709842 so while the loss of jobs is not high compared to the recessions after 1990 and 2000 the pain residents are feeling is definitely not just in their head state and local governments already struggling with budget problems in 2008 will almost certainly face additional problems next year as a strong housing and economic recovery is at least a year away
4709843 it is abundantly clear that the states economy is sagging in a dramatic way with little sign of stabilization
4709844 what this means for the state budget is watch out
4709845 all of these problems come back and hit the state right in the pocketbook it means the 17 billion the state says is the size of the deficit will be larger they have no choice but to raise taxes or cut spending
4709846 medical costs were declining for several years in a row due to the workers comp reforms that went into effect in 2004
4709847 this increase is primarily based on increasing medical costs for claims from the years 2006 and 2007
4709848 i wouldnt expect everyone to file a 16 percent increase
4709849 im not sure rate increases are really going to happen on january im thinking more like july
4709850 but this means at some point we will see a significant rate increase
4709851 this nightmare is finished so they can get on with their lives
4709852 we are pleased to announce a comprehensive solution for the liquidity needs of clients who purchased auction rate securities at wachovia and to resolve this matter with federal and state regulators
4709853 rest assured that we are taking aggressive steps to fully understand the root cause of this weeks problems and safeguard against issues like these in the future for now were just happy to be able to get back to doing what we love most delighting our customers
4709854 personally id like to see us in 40 or 50 communities within a year
4709855 thats a lot of money i dont know how i feel i dont think id give it up at this point
4709856 were just engineers and software people out of silicon valley with mortgages to pay and kids in school
4709857 but we want to do something besides sell products to the west more than just the next gizmo that goes on a cell phone
4709858 they saw this thing with battery connections and circuit boards and wouldnt allow it on the flight
4709859 this is so close to our hearts and so important that were stepping out of the high tech startup field
4709860 its amazing to watch them from a distance the enormous growth the sense that they can make a difference as a kid
4709861 sommerhusene vil for alvor falde i v rdi de n ste r og det skyldes den tyske konoi et sommerhus i reimelig stand oster 1 000 euro at leje i h js sonen jeg tror at det er for meget for tyskerne
4709862 og det kommer til at g ud over sommerhusejerne i danmark
4709863 hvis jeg skulle pege p et segment p boligmarkedet hvor der er st rst risiko for prisfald s der det sommerhusene
4709864 hvis folk ikke f r den rette pris for deres sommerhus s venter de det kan de tillade sig fordi danskernes kono er s god som det er tilf ldet i jeblikket
4709865 right now im happy to be a san francisco giant my only plan is its up to these guys team management my job is to play as hard as i can and the rest takes care of itself i want to be an impact player for the giants for a long time
4709866 hes the type of player we need we want to bring in a lot of players like him i dont like to put a timetable on anybody and i definitely wont put one on buster but i will say he has the ability and makeup to be a team player to help us win
4709867 its a little easier when everyone gets the job done
4709868 you need them you hate to go through a series like we did in houston especially when we had the lead every game the last thing we want to do is overwork these starting pitchers youve got to take care of your assets
4709869 he stuck with me its a huge vote of confidence
4709870 youre going to go through your ups and downs if you dont have management and the coaches in your corner youre going to stay in the valley
4709871 all i can think of is when i hit it people arent catching it

4709880 this group managed to get p10 million but continued to demand ransom from the victims relatives
4709881 based on reports we are getting his group had planned to kidnap local businessmen
4709882 it did not explode as expected by whoever lobbed it because it hang fired
4709883 we returned fire and the rebels withdraw after six minutes
4709884 majority of them have returned home after the military cleared all the 15 villages occupied by the milf those still at the evacuation centers are owners of houses burned in the clashes
4709885 many displaced people have found shelter in evacuation centers near their homes they mainly need food and basic shelter items such as tarpaulins water containers and mosquito nets

4709887 newyork you are the coffee house where i sat so often let me open your door and maybe i can sit down for a while just like a beggar who rests on a bench and look around at what remains within me and all around
4709888 you cant test during a race weekend and youve got to come in with a plan and really go for it
4709889 qualifying is tough and its important to do consistent fast laps and then we go racing its nice to get a day of testing in
4709890 i think you will see some new passing with this change
4709891 its a tough corner because youre going from the fastest section of the track to the slowest but it should be good

4709893 out of all the communist countries hungary had the most other countries like then czechoslovakia had the skoda romania the dacia the soviet union the lada and east germany also had the wartburg in hungary there are still 300 000 trabants on the road it seems like there are less because there are so many other brands too but the trabants are not disappearing
4709894 but look at all the other cars on the road a 20 year old zhiguli is much worse its just the trabis blue smelly smoke is so obvious
4709895 not everybody treats their trabi as a hobby for many it is a useful tool taking them to work and back
4709896 the trabant was an innovation a world class car then
4709897 now everything is automated the trabant would be too expensive to make
4709898 communism did not allow fancy models in anything although some special trabants were built they were locked in museums and their blue prints burnt
4709899 it is easy to drive easy to mend you just get in it and go
4709900 in this building operated the buda uprising groups and the organizers of the new democratic national revolutionary forces
4709901 lajos batth ny was executed in the revolution in 1849 with three bullets his body was hidden in the church on r k czi t and he could not rest in peace until 1867 he was disturbed again in 1993 when grave robbers stole his ft 22 million sword they overlooked his wifes ft 11 million earrings which have now been placed in the national museum for safekeeping
4709902 it was often pointed out to visiting officials to test if they were paying attention she really lived and ironically was a young jewish member of the partisans the name and dates 1917 1945 are identical to hitlers mistress
4709903 the two groups were buried on opposite sides because if there was a memorial service for both groups on the same day there would be fights
4709904 the spirit within me goes with you it will be there among you all you will always find me among your flowers when they wither you will find me in the leaves when they fall down you will hear me in the evening peal of bells when they die away and when you remember me i will always be standing by you face to face

4709906 however andr ssy t turned out even better and under its length in 1896 we created the first underground railway on the european continent three years before paris

4709913 its operation makes less noise its easier and safer to stop quickly than other trains and it does not pollute the streets does not produce smoke and does not induce sparks either
4709914 in fact budapest was the first city in the world with a permanent town central tram system
4709915 over are the days of the battles which cost us so many broken necks sprained wrists flattened feet fractured noses and ribs battles only fought by those reckless enough to brave the dangers involved in forcefully occupying an omnibus seat
4709916 budapests first tramway had a narrow track and the electric current was supplied from below since the authorities said overhead lines were too ugly
4709917 this device made travel rather unreliable as mud or snow could get into the power line upsetting traffic for half a day
4709918 tram routes in those days were always incredibly long it was quite usual for a journey from terminus to terminus to take well over an hour
4709919 historians now argue as to whether certain trams were bordeaux colored or bottle green since the only photographic record we have is obviously in black and white
4709920 the steepest tram route is the number 59 up to farkasr ti cemetery if it gets any steeper you have to use a cog wheel railway like the train that runs up to szech nyi hegy
4709921 we have come the end of the backward trend of closing tram lines factories are just waiting to build new trams all we need is more investment
4709922 the best thing about living in pest is the view of buda
4709923 in this place stood kossuth bridge our workers heroic and self sacrificing work in eight months built the bridge as a temporary replacement for all the bridges senselessly blown up by the fascists on january 18 1946 on the first anniversary of the last fascist bombing it was opened to traffic its temporary objective completed it was taken down in 1960
4709924 to commemorate the only two surviving bridges designed by william tierney clark the sz chenyi chain bridge over the danube in budapest and the suspension bridge over the thames at marlow england
4709925 for eternity disfigure our world city whose glorious sights have so often invigorated visitors from home and abroad
4709926 so eine interessante trainerkonstellation hat es wirklich schon lange nicht mehr gegeben wenn das eine mannschaft w re k nnte man sagen die mischung zwischen jung und alt stimmt
4709927 cottbus muss schon sehr gut sein um uns zu schlagen
4709928 jefferson war sehr gut drauf wie man im spiel gegen madrid sehen konnte aber trotz seines ausfalls habe ich volles vertrauen in die st rke unseres kaders
4709929 der 1 fc k ln ist von den drei aufsteigern der reichste klub sie werden in der liga eine gute rolle spielen deshalb m ssen wir am samstag h llisch aufpassen
4709930 cottbus muss schon sehr gut sein um uns zu schlagen auch wenn uns dort sicher nicht der rote teppich ausgerollt wird

4709932 das wird ein interessantes spiel zum auftakt bruno labbadia ist als trainer eine bereicherung f r die bundesliga
4709933 ihn kann keiner ersetzen die rolle von diego kann nur diego spielen
4709934 wenn wir gegen bielefeld unsere chancen nutzen dann wird es keinen einfluss haben ob diego da ist oder nicht
4709935 die mannschaft brennt darauf nach sieben wochen vorbereitung aus der box gelassen werden
4709936 so eine interessante trainerkonstellation hat es schon lange nicht mehr gegeben

4709941 no me gust no es as como me gusta sentirme
4709942 fue una pelea normal re ida pero lamentablemente no se decidi en el ring sino que la decisi n la tomaron los jueces
4709943 una gigantesca fiesta para la raza humana al estilo de un carnaval
4709944 va a ser una ceremonia muy distinta a la de inauguraci n que tuvo una gran carga de responsabilidad al tener que explicar la cultura china al mundo
4709945 con un ambiente mucho m s despreocupado como una mezcla de alboroto liberador alegr a y euforia
4709946 no siento ninguna presi n esa la han creado los periodistas pero de lo que s soy consciente es de que tengo que dar la cara por puerto rico y lo hago en cada pelea
4709947 siempre dije que era algo personal el hacer bien las cosas en pek n
4709948 estoy confiado en lo que puedo conseguir y la pelea de hoy pudo concluir en n caut de no haber sido porque mi rival lleg muy bien preparado f sicamente
4709949 de no haber cometido algunos errores tambi n la puntuaci n ser a mayor
4709950 ambos nos conocemos sabemos lo que podemos hacer en el cuadril tero pero tengo tiempo hasta el mi rcoles cuando se de la pelea para corregir los errores que comet en mi debut
4709951 no hay rival f cil todos los que llegan aqu pueden ganar por lo tanto la respuesta estar en el cuadril tero
4709952 en estos momentos me siento bien he quitado un peso con el debut pero tambi n noto que me falta ese algo m s que espero conseguir en la pr xima pelea
4709953 si tuviera m s fuerza podr a mejorar los resultados de borges
4709954 mi objetivo era estar entre los seis primeros lugares no lo cumpl por lo cual pido una disculpa
4709955 nunca promet una medalla nunca me colgu una medalla antes de tiempo
4709956 pero las condiciones no me fueron favorables y siempre duele no cumplir una meta
4709957 voy a ser un atleta m s maduro f sicamente m s experimentado y esperar que las cosas se vayan dando
4709958 me dol an las espinillas bastante en los primeros ocho kil metros y me empec a desesperar
4709959 trat de empezar otra vez y hacer un buen papel
4709960 resulta extraordinaria para ecuador porque le gan a los grandes campeones por m s que el primero haya sido el ruso que ha resultado un monstruo del deporte
4709961 jefferson p rez nos trae una nueva medalla que nos honra y nos llena de gran felicidad porque especialmente ha dado una gran muestra que con humildad esfuerzo y trabajo todo se puede
4709962 para ecuador es muy importante este mensaje que le da p rez a toda la juventud
4709963 con toda seguridad se le tributar el m s grande recibimiento al m s grande deportista ecuatoriano de todos los tiempos
4709964 estamos muy contentos porque ecuador hizo un buen resultado con jefferson p rez
4709965 la presi n carga mucho y muchos que estaban para subirse al podio se quedaron
4709966 el marcador dice que yo puse la mano en el muro primero
4709967 el sistema dice esto yo siempre he o do que no puede haber un error en el sistema de cronometraje lo nico que puedo decir es que fue una carrera dura y que nad lo mejor que pude
4709968 yo sab a que no estaba tan detr s de cavic como en la eliminatoria cuando cort la ltima brazada pens que me costar a la carrera pero fue justamente lo contrario si yo me hubiera deslizado no habr a ido tan lejos hice dos r pidas brazadas cortas para intentar llegar y tocar el muro al final tome la decisi n correcta
4709969 vi la carrera despu s en la pantalla gigante y la vi a c mara lenta imagen a imagen en la c mara de masaje en el ordenador
4709970 esto demuestra que no importa lo que pongas en tu imaginaci n que cualquier cosa puede pasar sue a tanto como puedas so ar y cualquier cosa ser posible
4709971 algunas personas dec an que esto ser a imposible y no pasar a esto muestra que cualquier cosa puede suceder antes de que yo fuera a entrenar con bob bowman entrenador del equipo de los estados unidos es el nico que realmente me ayud a querer so ar acerca de cualquier cosa
4709972 yo quer a ser un atleta profesional y s quer a ganar medallas ol mpicas pero l es el nico que me dijo que so ara que so ara tanto como pudiera finalmente ha ocurrido el duro trabajo que bob y yo hemos realizado juntos nos ha dado sus frutos
4709973 yo sab a que ten a que estar a medio cuerpo de distancia de crocker ian estadounidense yo corro mucho contra l tengo la capacidad de saber d nde necesito estar en los 50 metros para ganar si tengo medio cuerpo s que esta bien cuando vi a crocker en el giro sab a que cavic estar a en alguna parte con l yo pod a ver algo de l de reojo
4709974 ya lo he dicho antes y lo seguir diciendo mi meta principal es cambiar el deporte de la nataci n por los chicos que vienen a este deporte y por el deporte en am rica
4709975 as que dijo mi meta se est empezando a cumplir pero me queda un largo camino todav a
4709976 creo que bob y yo podemos pensar en m s objetivos en los pr ximos cuatro a os
4709977 si bob y yo hici ramos esto por dinero estar amos en otro deporte
4709978 estoy en una especie de mundo de los sue os algunas veces me tengo que pinchar a m mismo para estar seguro de que es real estoy feliz de estar en el mundo real
4709979 siempre me toc esperar a la sombra de peleadores como maikro romero yan barthelemy yuriolski gamboa pero ahora soy yo el que tengo en mis manos la posibilidad de darle una medalla a mi pa s
4709980 lo conoc a de haberme enfrentado con anterioridad y sab a como ten a que hacer las cosas aunque no siempre me salieron bien
4709981 aunque te entrenas si no subes al cuadril tero notas la falta de contacto y eso fue lo que sucedi pero ahora mi confianza es mayor y adem s liberado de la presi n del debut
4709982 lo conozco bien de haber peleado antes y al margen de que tiene una buena pegada es muy t cnico por lo que ser muy complicado el ganarlo pero lo intentar
4709983 me sent confiado pero en el primer asalto sal a estudiar mi rival en el segundo me solt y salieron todos los golpes despu s en el tercero me aguante un poco y en el cuarto me sent muy bien f sicamente
4709984 no sent a presi n alguna aunque sab a que deb a sacar la cara por el equipo porque no nos fue muy bien aqu
4709985 no siento preocupaci n aqu no hay rival peque o ni grande todos est n muy bien y vienen con el mismo prop sito yo estoy bien concentrado en hacer el trabajo d a a d a sin presionarme porque tengo fe y todo saldr bien de momento estoy en los juegos y me siento realizado
4709986 me torc un tobillo al pisar una botella de agua
4709987 hab a entrenado muy bien y mi idea era hacer en torno a la hora y veinte minutos finalmente hizo 1 27 09 pero en el kil metro 8 pis una botella de agua y me torc un tobillo tuve que pararme para colocarme la zapatilla bien y perd mucho tiempo demasiado
4709988 la experiencia ha sido fant stica excitante y ya estoy deseando que lleguen los juegos de londres para tener otra oportunidad de competir y demostrar cu l es mi verdadero valor como marchador
4709989 los dos han demostrado que son los mejores de la elite de la marcha el nivel de la prueba ha sido excelente y quiero felicitar p blicamente a jefferson porque ha demostrado que es un gran campe n
4709990 resulta extraordinaria para ecuador porque le gan a los grandes campeones por m s que el primero haya sido el ruso que ha resultado un monstruo del deporte
4709991 jefferson p rez nos trae una nueva medalla que nos honra y nos llena de gran felicidad porque especialmente ha dado una gran muestra que con humildad esfuerzo y trabajo todo se puede

4709994 son mis primeros juegos y la verdad es que estoy muy satisfecho y feliz sal muy fuerte y en el grupo de delante del estadio porque no quer a que me sorprendieran muy pronto y despu s pagu el esfuerzo pagu la novatada
4709995 esta experiencia me servir para no volver a cometer el mismo error porque hab a hecho unos buenos entrenamientos y esperaba hacer un tiempo mejor
4709996 ha sido una experiencia muy positiva convivir en la villa ol mpica con los mejores deportistas del mundo entrar en este magn fico estadio todo ha sido bueno excepto mi clasificaci n que pod a haber sido mejor
4709997 estoy satisfecho con la novena plaza pero no contento ven a para m s al menos ese era mi sue o pero ha habido un gran nivel en la prueba he tenido buenas sensaciones y en cada paso sab a que avanzaba conmigo un pueblo entero y los 140 000 polic as de mi pa s
4709998 los jueces me se alaron dos faltas y tuve que ser un poco m s conservador para poder finalizar la carrera no pude ser tan agresivo como al comienzo eso me limit un poco
4709999 yo quer a que hiciera m s calor pero estuvo bien en cuanto a la alfombra fue fant stica no lo hab a visto nunca dos kil metros de alfombra para correr los 20 km marcha esto s lo se puede hacer en china
