5220007 the main thing about child health checks is that in of themselves they will not improve the health of that child

5220028 i didnt know anything about this illness at all nor did any of my friends
5220029 but ive found out that around one person in 100 will experience it at some time and so in an average secondary school with 1 000 pupils there are about 10 that could be affected
5220030 that really shocked me and had me thinking maybe i already know someone who could be affected and i dont even realise it
5220031 its really opened my eyes to the suffering that people go through and what a terrible effect this illness can have on someones life

5220036 es gibt auf der ganzen welt kein technisches bezahlverfahren das betr ger erkennt

5220038 solche dinge k nnen nat rlich genau so gut in deutschland passieren
5220039 aus diesem grund sagen wir das einzig wirklich sichere bezahlverfahren muss wie iclear auf treuh nderischer basis arbeiten weil es vor allem auch betr gerischen h ndlern keine chance l sst denn iclear verwaltet das geld des k ufers als treuh nder und leitet es erst an den h ndler weiter wenn der kunde seine ware ordnungsgem erhalten hat andernfalls erh lt der k ufer sein geld ohne jegliche abz ge zur ck

5220068 nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year i know how difficult it is to win these things and especially here because you only have one chance every four years
5220069 i never expected a medal gold silver or bronze its unbelievable for me this is the best moment in my career
5220070 it does mean more for me to win it with serena to share this kind of moment with your sister i mean we are practically joined at the hip
5220071 sort of a dream come true moment maybe it comes around once in a lifetime its almost disbelief to some degree
5220072 were leaving china on a high we were obviously disappointed that we couldnt make the gold medal match but its going to be something really special to us to have that medal back at home
5220073 to win any medal in the olympics is a huge achievement not many of the athletes get a chance to win a medal
5220074 i felt like i competed hard i have to take something positive from the way i was playing this week
5220075 im the most consistent player so thats why i became number one in the world and my time will come im only 23 years old its not like im at the end of my career
5220076 i came here to win an olympic medal and realistically i was only ever going to win one in either singles or doubles if i had to pick one id like to win it with my brother
5220077 the crowd cheered me with so much passion and many of them used my hometown dialect it was great to play in front of them
5220078 you know the feeling when you remember something and smile in the darkness i had this kind of smile on my face that night
5220079 he cant win all the time it is not humanly possible i think now the pressure is off so watch out
5220080 rafa played great to get it thats what i expected and hoped for many years ago when i got to number one that if ever somebody were to take it away from me he would have to play an incredible tennis schedule win the biggest tournaments dominate the game basically i think rafa totally deserves it
5220081 this is definitely not the way i wanted to go out but i am looking forward to getting a week on court to focus on things not in a match situation
5220082 roger has been dominating everyone for four years and now nadal is beating everyone for me there are two number ones
5220083 she served really well she kept it deep and i was always under pressure my serve wasnt that good and she has one of the best on the tour so there was a huge gap
5220084 i wouldnt mind playing roger or rafa i just think it would be fun to play on a big court and get that experience but whoever i play is fine im just looking forward to the opportunity
5220085 it is impossible really there are so many athletes asking for photos and so on it is not ideal to prepare

5220102 its becoming increasingly important that we keep our professional and social lives separate and manage our online reputation as effectively as possible
5220103 there have been plenty of stories lately involving the type of behaviour that is completely inappropriate for a work environment people need to realise that even virtual actions can have very real consequences
5220104 we might have to bring a few young players back in this week because if you do lose or you are not playing well at least youre gaining something from it
5220105 theres not a lot to be gained from losing with the same sort of team
5220106 at least this year weve introduced a lot of new players
5220107 its all relative if we dont make the eight and we blood some young kids thats a positive
5220108 if you make the eight and you havent blooded any kids and you finish in the first week of the finals whats better
5220109 i think every team sets out to make the eight at the start of the year and we are still in the mix so thats a real important factor at this time of the year
5220110 i would certainly rather be playing in games that definitely have a degree of pressure and then the young guys who are playing them are learning something
5220111 the cupboard is a little bit bare in terms of weve got a lot of rookies but they cant all play
5220112 barely a hundred years ago lebanese christians readily proclaimed themselves syrian syrians looked to mecca for a king jews in the holy land called themselves palestinian and my grandfather botros liked to think of himself as an ottoman citizen none of the present day middle eastern states existed and even the term middle east hadnt been invented the commonly used term was asian turkey since then scores of people have died for allegedly eternal homelands and many more will die tomorrow
5220113 the main aim will be to weaken americas position in the middle east in this respect there are differences of opinion in the kremlin some ex generals have come on record to the effect that a war with america is inevitable in a perspective of 10 15 years the influence of these radical military men should not be overrated but it is certainly true that the belief that america is russias worst and most dangerous enemy is quite common the downfall of the soviet empire is thought to be mainly if not entirely americas fault washington it is believed is trying to hurt russia all the time in every possible way
5220114 ive had a fantastic relationship with our club our people its been great and its been 12 years now that ive been at the club ever since it opened its door
5220115 i understand times come in football and if the club decides its time to go and its not for me theyll look around and ill look around and thats where it is
5220116 but my choice if you ask me is to stay here and get the club back to where id like to see it at the top of the ladder
5220117 its really entirely up to the club when the contract is negotiated
5220118 ive got another year of my contract to go and over the last 12 years three of them weve finished top and weve won a premiership they never negotiated my contract any time prior to that the end of the existing deal so i cant imagine they would do it now
5220119 our players have some experience theyve got a little older the results might not show that but certainly we dont think were as bad as the position on the ladder is
5220120 but were not going to complain and say anything about that its only up to us to prove that from now on

5220143 it is not an exaggaration to say that umm kalthum is the most loved arab of the last several centuries from bin laden s perspective she and anyone who listens to her are infidels or at least behaving in infidel esque behavior for example the looming tower tells the story of how a young bin laden flipped at his driver who actually dared to play one of her cassetes for every one person in the meast who would side with bl in this dispute there are at least 5 000 who would tell him to pack sand what does this have to do with analyzing aq those who don t know where umm kalthum stands in arab society or even know who she is in the first place are also not qualified to speak about where al qaeda stands either

5220150 we have an ssnp flag right under us im looking at their guys as we speak
5220151 the ones that i can see are holding their guns they stop cars like every time a car passes by they stop the car if they like it theyll let it go if they dont theyll make it turn around
5220152 right now were looking at about 10 militiamen with what are rpgs mounted on their shoulders carrying big guns there are loud bangs followed by militiamen running down hamra
5220153 there were guys in fatigues at first i thought they were army but now im not so sure because they were wearing masks on their faces and now these guys arent in any kinds of uniforms it has been surreal
5220154 on hamra street i dont know about ten tanks were rolling down the street a couple of hours ago
5220155 they were just talking to the militia guys standing next to them and just hanging out there were not as far as i can tell any requests for them to go home

5220158 i was walking hamra street ten minutes ago and there was one hezbollah soldier each five meters
5220159 it seems to be under their control these are the real fighters its like an army with full equipment and weapons they are really well equipped more than the lebanese army by far

5220189 viral loops expand according to whats known as a power law curve which for reasons no one can explain seem to accurately describe a dizzying array of natural and unnatural phenomena from the size of planets to national income distribution to online commerce
5220190 a viral expansion loop is a descriptor for the phenomenon of exponential growth via referrals in a social network or other similar product or service what this means is that friends invite friends who invite friends and so the growth is exponential if one continues with the biological analogy the long term impact of the resulting infection is largely determined by the lifespan of the virus in the host a virus like smallpox is devastating but it works fast and 35 of the time the host dies which is the reason why it could eventually be contained in marketing terms this means that applications that result in viral expansion loops can burn out quickly if the hosts continuously lose interest this is why facebook and other applications are constantly working to bolt on new functionality to extend the period of infection and keep the host alive

5220196 i felt like i threw the ball well moved around ok
5220197 ten days ago i was doing yard work my arm feels great ive been throwing the ball well i just feel like once i get the timing down with these guys ill be ok
5220198 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
5220199 we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a cripple
5220200 salvation is found in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given to us by which we must be saved
5220201 when they saw the courage of peter and john and realized that they were unschooled ordinary men they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with jesus

5220203 we are delighted to build our business with general mills adding the world famous haagen dazs products to our northern ireland portfolio
5220204 dale farm ice cream is a core part of our consumer products business and we produce a very strong portfolio of products ourselves including dale farm favourites like pear picking porky mr frostie and polly pineapple and premium adult brands such as the rapture range
5220205 however an important part of our business development plan is to grow revenue through strategic distribution partnerships with other leading brands particularly within the premium categories which are high value and deliver strong sales on a year round basis
5220206 having sole distribution of the haagan dazs brand is a major coup for us as it is the number one brand dominating the super premium ice cream sector instantly recognised by consumers and achieving nearly 75 market share
5220207 our ability to develop such important distribution partnerships is down to our first rate supply chain capabilities and extensive established customer network
5220208 to capitalise on all sales opportunities we need to have a robust distribution network and dale farm is well placed to drive our products into the fullest range of outlets working with them has gained us additional important listings locally we look forward to maximising the value of this partnership going forward
5220209 the slowdown in the northern ireland construction industry has resulted in a number of funding delays across the entire market
5220210 this has naturally impacted particularly hard on the public sector meaning that timelines have had to be reviewed for a number of projects
5220211 in order to ensure the ongoing successful management of the company we have therefore had to review our own cost efficiencies and streamline the business in a way that will allow us to more effectively adapt to these tightening conditions
5220212 it is unfortunate that this has resulted in six members of staff being made redundant but if we are to safeguard the rest of our employees as well as continue to maintain growth and profit margins for the benefit of our shareholders it is essential that we remain realistic in the face of a challenging economy
5220213 we hadnt been performing that well we were a poor team coming into this match and we havent become a great team because of that result
5220214 we have wexford next and we saw how they fully deserved their victory over armagh they could have won by more
5220215 were under no illusions about the size of the task we have on our hands in a couple of weeks time
5220216 there were a few important factors the goals coming at important times took the momentum out of dublin and losing their captain very early on in the game took a great deal of focus out of their attack
5220217 alan brogan would get on any team in ireland hes one of the top marksmen in the country and whenever you take that out of a team it does affect it especially so early in the match
5220218 coupled with a few bad wides they had at the start they probably didnt play to their potential
5220219 id like to praise the players not only on todays panel but the players that ive dealt with over the last four years for what they have given to the dublin jersey and the pride they have put back into the dublin jersey
5220220 i not only got to know them in a sporting sense but i know i have friends for life
5220221 its been a wonderful opportunity its been a great journey and unfortunately we didnt get the end that we desired
5220222 heartiest congratulations to tyrone those who know football knew that tyrone were no bad team coming into todays game
5220223 we certainly had a healthy respect for them some of the bookies that were quoting them at 3 1 must have been off their heads we couldnt match them
5220224 yes it was a frustrating way for it to end but these things happen and overall i was delighted with my performance
5220225 i took a bit of time to settle into the car on friday but once we made adjustments to the set up i got comfortable and was fastest on every stage on saturday to build a very comfortable lead over the best s1600 drivers around at the moment
5220226 if i was chasing a championship i would be more upset and although it would have been nice to return to the wrc with a win i think i still made my point
5220227 we along with the independent supervalu and centra retailers throughout northern ireland are extremely proud of our partnership with action cancer
5220228 we will continue to raise funds for and generate awareness of the charitys work for the long term this will help maintain the positive impact its services has on the health and well being of local communities
5220229 seconds before that the number 10 jumped into mick mcmanus so it was a foul before that
5220230 i thought we should have had that decision so we wouldnt be talking about the penalty
5220231 wexford won promotion to division two in the national league they reached the leinster final they have since beaten armagh is anyone seriously going to tell me that they are not where they are on merit
5220232 wir haben unser spiel durch unachtsamkeiten eingerissen wie schon letzte saison einige male jetzt passiert uns die gleiche schei e schon wieder
5220233 beide tore entstehen aus standards da m ssen sich manche spieler schon hinterfragen bei standards muss ich doch bei meinem mann sein das hat nichts mit k nnen zu tun sondern mit konzentration
5220234 she was looking at me as if to say who are you i hated it
5220235 i started to brood and felt like a five star prisoner
5220236 i watched a dvd of ellie playing and almost immediately sadness and anxiety swept over me it was as if someone had sucked the spirit from my body the black wings fluttered
5220237 i felt myself fighting for breath and for a single moments peace god make it stop please
5220238 it was as if someone flicked a switch and i knew it was over i asked the umpire if i could go off for a leak and i never came back
5220239 im able to enjoy every day life without problems i am off medication and can even go on a foreign holiday with my family and be totally untroubled but i know my limits
5220240 i have built strategies to deal with my depression and understand it better that it is a physical illness not a weakness of character i wouldnt have wished it on my worst enemy
5220241 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver the pregnancy
5220242 its one thing to take our money and do what they did to harm us
5220243 its another to dismiss our grieving that is the ultimate slap
5220244 the apa should advocate a closer examination of the grief and warn women of the well documented dangers of abortion
5220245 instead the apa continues to censor information de legitimize research prohibit opposing points of view obstruct discussions avoid scholarly debates and promote intolerance of those who are negatively impacted by abortion
5220246 abortion violates the civil rights and human rights of the baby in the womb and then it hurts the mother
5220247 the apa wants to say we are the exception to the rule but for every one woman they can find that says they werent harmed by abortion they could find 10 women who were
5220248 significant numbers of women who suffer serious physical mental or psychological trauma as a result of abortion
5220249 some women do experience sadness grief and feelings of loss following an abortion and some may experience clinically significant disorders including depression and anxiety
5220250 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
5220251 the study has to be politically motivated to perpetuate the myth that abortion is a helpful and positive choice for women
5220252 the study ignores the testimonies of women who have had several psychological and emotional issues after having an abortion
5220253 im holding this sign because i cant hold my two children
5220254 i wish i could put the authors of the study in a room with us and have them look into our eyes and tell us about the report
5220255 i would not be surprised if it is windy enough to cause some disruption with trees in full leaf and heavy rain weakening soil it does not take much to bring branches down
5220256 the good news is the weather should calm down later in the week
5220257 it also required the company to retain all the pension liabilities for current and former employees of the retail business which is unacceptable to the board
5220258 it aint nothing crazy like hes missing or whatever i just want accountability to make sure that he dont come up there while hes on his time to do something crazy because i asked him to call me but he never called
5220259 so im just trying to cover my ground to say hes there or hes with his wife because i know they got a little problem or whatever the case may be
5220260 search of the centralized operations police system did not reveal any prior domestic assault allegations or weapons registered to sgt lopez or mrs lopez
5220261 review of sgt lopezs medical records showed there were no indicators of post traumatic stress disorder and he was not prescribed any medication for ptsd
5220262 sgt lopez and his wife were pending a divorce for some unknown act of infidelity
5220263 i tried to come here and be the right person for my wife and kids but i guess im not the right person im messed up boss im messed up
5220264 i was a lot worse off over there than i showed my life is so messed up right now i couldnt take it im figuring out how to stay alive
5220265 hes suicidal and i dont want nothing to happen to this young soldier
5220266 i was wondering if someone could go by his parents house and see if hes at his parents house or if they know where hes at and let them know that yes hes sending his boss text messages about suicidal thoughts
5220267 maybe theyll tell where this man is at so we can get him back here and get him some help
5220268 i dont want this dude to commit suicide or to kill his family you know and thats whats on our minds right now
5220269 im actually trying to help steven were worried about him and the welfare of his family right now
5220270 thats probably why hes worried about coming in he thinks hes going to get arrested for being awol
5220271 im not going to have him dead tomorrow because i didnt go find him
5220272 im not getting him in trouble he should know me better than that
5220273 just so you know youre not in any trouble they havent put out any warrants or anything for you being gone so thats not what its about
5220274 hes having a rough time but he says hes not going to hurt himself
5220275 i told him that he needed to get his butt back right away so hopefully hes going to take that to heart
5220276 ill probably give you a call probably thursday or friday of this week
5220277 my dad is buying me a bus ticket asap since the army quit paying me after six years of my life i gave to it ill call you or someone when i get to the bus stop

5220283 one of the biggest predictors of reporting sexual problems is having anxiety depression stress or saying your mental health is poor
5220284 if someone is having trouble in the bedroom treating those issues can very well improve the situation
5220285 we know that alcohol at a moderate level improves health
5220286 it seems to improve cardiovascular functioning sex is exercise and it may be that its improving all over functionality which makes women more likely to be sexually active
5220287 people are more likely to forget about those things that made them angry that are getting in the way of their sex life
5220288 its really important they learn a little bit more about it so they can get out there have fun and not feel different
5220289 they may feel like they have to sit on the sidelines but its not necessary to feel that way
5220290 my lungs start hurting i wheeze and cough a lot
5220291 we want kids to recognize the symptoms and to know what to do so we have less deaths

5220323 i tried to get james in to the council to open them up and get them to understand this stuff i completely failed but james did enough to inspire me to leave and set up on my own
5220324 barnet is at the vanguard of redefining what a council is theyre trying to work out how they can become an enabler for the people in their area theyre trying to do something better than sending out surveymonkey surveys theyre trying to open up the policy making process
5220325 ok so theres only 25 fans at the moment and theyre all council employees but the very fact barnet is on facebook moves it to a different place
5220326 anything freewear or open source is seen as flakey or dangerous theres a saying that you wont get fired for buying microsoft all these people are microsoft certified and microsoft is flooding local government almost every time i go into a council i walk past a sharepoint salesman
5220327 for people working in councils the only contact they get with the outside world is when someone visits from sap logica or microsoft this person tells them that whatever theyre selling is cutting edge and theyll hand over 1 million
5220328 putting organisations like that into a network instead of running them as walled hierarchies is a massive step at the moment its only beginning to happen and thats just in marketing
5220329 its gotta be another twenty years until things really start to change the people in their twenties now whove grown up with computers theyre the ones who are going to do all this web 2 0 stuff naturally
5220330 to be honest id rather government step back and let the social innovators private entrepreneurs do stuff local government should actually worry about little else than being a series of listening posts keeping an ear to the ground on what people really need and want
5220331 can he get title for liverpool as ronaldo did last season why not of course they are different players he comes in from the side but fernando is a real striker he has everything to be the best player this season
5220332 there was nothing on when he got the ball but he scores a few goals like that he is always looking for the target and as soon as he gets space to shoot he shoots and often scores
5220333 he is a megastar now but not only is he a great striker but also a great personality he is just the same on the pitch in the dressing room outside the game
5220334 off the pitch he is just a normal guy just one of us but on the pitch he is different
5220335 im not a religious man im spiritual i think a lot of it has to do with god having a calling on my life sometimes it takes bad things to wake you up and realize that god wants you to be who he wants you to be
5220336 im still going through a lot but im just trying to make it
5220337 he feels better looks better in just the couple days hes been here weve seen a little bit of a sense of relief when youre talking to him again well just take it day by day and see how he does
5220338 initially the first thing we didnt talk about football we talked about making sure shawn was ok and that he got the help he needed then when we felt that he was in a good place we talked about the football part of it the football part is secondary to the person we want to make sure the persons all right
5220339 people were coming to my house unannounced to get me out and to talk and to see whats going in because i was in my room talking to people just thinking
5220340 they were very concerned and i was on the edge things werent going well so i felt like i must open up before its too late

5220498 i salute the archbishop and bishops of africa for resisting disorientation and a decadent culture which he said was being passed by western nations
5220499 dont fear resist and do not compromise on that it is a danger not only to the believers but to the whole of africa it is bad if our children become complacent and think that people who are not in order are alright

5220548 everyone has written stoke off before a ball has been kicked that they will go straight back down but they will cause teams a lot of problems
5220549 they will be a difficult game for everyone theyve got the commitment organisation and desire and they will not be found wanting at all

5220561 no im glad they took me in that way i can open up things
5220562 no only the locks and thats it i had asked the palace guards to open the door im the owner i told em they refused to open the door so i gave the guys command to take off the lock so they did what i told them
5220563 they will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law people in this case have to be shown its just not going to be acceptable as you know this is one of the most cherished sites in our state
5220564 you have heard about twitter maybe its something other people do mainly younger people you subscribe to the service then you can post little messages on peoples cellphones or on their instant message accounts about nothing
5220565 im interested in telling narratives and advocating peoples existent feelings
5220566 this mission is an amazing opportunity to have a huge impact on this hard locked heart locked crisis ive never been to gaza myself but i know that gaza is the forgotten little brother of the middle east or at least of the israeli palestinian crisis everything about this crisis is clearer in gaza the israeli occupation strategy is much clearer in gaza because its not specifically about taking more land its mostly about completely destroying a people
5220567 americans are terribly ignorant of the human effects of what they support i think this boat is one of the most effective means of raising consciousness particularly american consciousness about the problems caused by american foreign policy americans have to know the consequences of these policies im sixty four years old my children are grown and my affairs are in order i think about rachel corrie and about what israel may do to us i know its risky but i take a risk when i ride a motorcycle and i think that if were really going to change things then somebody has to begin putting something on the line for that change to happen
5220568 for years and years seeing place in the world that were being totally destroyed and people that were being totally destroyed by other people and governments i thought theres nothing that i could do
5220569 no one is paying attention to whats happening in gaza no one is listening to palestinians they are slowly being strangulated by israel and no one is even listening i cant sit outside of this and just let it happen we as human beings have an obligation to stand up and i cant be passive about it you cant stand up in london and just say that you dont agree we need to find ways to connect people in the middle east particularly young people to people and groups in wealthier countries together we can inspire each other and together we can be much more than we are alone
5220570 the extent of dods contracting is particularly evident during prolonged large scale operations like those in iraq where there may not be enough military personnel available to provide logistics support
5220571 providing security for all personnel including contractors is an inescapable aspect of u s operations in iraq because of the instability and violence in that country
5220572 is at least 2 5 times higher than any other major u s conflict
5220573 it is exceptional the degree to which the militarys currently relying on such contractors
5220574 were of a much smaller scale than what we are seeing in iraq
5220575 the cost of having an army contingent provide the same services as blackwater appears to be roughly the same as the cost of the contract itself
5220576 one of the key questions surrounding the governments escalating use of military contractors is actually not whether they save the government client money or not rather the crucial question that should be asked at the onset of any potential outsourcing is simple should the task be done by a private company in the first place
5220577 friend has replaced any remote thought of ministry the stories far too difficult to hear must be heard a voice must be willing to speak so the world will understand

5220652 il popolo di un principe che verr distrugger la citt e il santuario la sua fine sar uninondazione e fino alla fine guerra e desolazioni decretate
5220653 14 quando vedrete labominio della desolazione stare l dove non conviene chi legge capisca allora quelli che si trovano nella giudea fuggano ai monti 15 chi si trova sulla terrazza non scenda per entrare a prender qualcosa nella sua casa 16 chi nel campo non torni indietro a prendersi il mantello 21 allora dunque se qualcuno vi dir ecco il cristo qui ecco l non ci credete 22 perch sorgeranno falsi cristi e falsi profeti e faranno segni e portenti per ingannare se fosse possibile anche gli eletti
5220654 1 vidi salire dal mare una bestia che aveva dieci corna e sette teste sulle corna dieci diademi e su ciascuna testa un titolo blasfemo 2 la bestia che io vidi era simile a una pantera con le zampe come quelle di un orso e la bocca come quella di un leone il drago le diede la sua forza il suo trono e la sua potest grande 3 una delle sue teste sembr colpita a morte ma la sua piaga mortale fu guarita allora la terra intera presa dammirazione and dietro alla bestia gli uomini adorarono il drago perch aveva dato il potere alla bestia e adorarono la bestia dicendo chi simile alla bestia e chi pu combattere con essa 5 alla bestia fu data una bocca per proferire parole dorgoglio e bestemmie con il potere di agire per quarantadue mesi 6 essa apr la bocca per proferire bestemmie contro dio per bestemmiare il suo nome e la sua dimora contro tutti quelli che abitano in cielo 7 le fu permesso di far guerra contro i santi e di vincerli le fu dato potere sopra ogni stirpe popolo lingua e nazione 8 ladorarono tutti gli abitanti della terra il cui nome non scritto fin dalla fondazione del mondo nel libro della vita dellagnello immolato
5220655 11 vidi poi salire dalla terra unaltra bestia che aveva due corna simili a quelle di un agnello che per parlava come un drago 12 essa esercita tutto il potere della prima bestia in sua presenza e costringe la terra e i suoi abitanti ad adorare la prima bestia la cui ferita mortale era guarita 13 operava grandi prodigi fino a fare scendere fuoco dal cielo sulla terra davanti agli uomini 14 per mezzo di questi prodigi che le era permesso di compiere in presenza della bestia sedusse gli abitanti della terra dicendo loro di erigere una statua alla bestia che era stata ferita dalla spada ma si era riavuta 15 le fu anche concesso di animare la statua della bestia sicch quella statua perfino parlasse e potesse far mettere a morte tutti coloro che non adorassero la statua della bestia 16 faceva s che tutti piccoli e grandi ricchi e poveri liberi e schiavi ricevessero un marchio sulla mano destra e sulla fronte 17 e che nessuno potesse comprare o vendere senza avere tale marchio cio il nome della bestia o il numero del suo nome 18 qui sta la sapienza chi ha intelligenza calcoli il numero della bestia essa rappresenta un nome duomo e tal cifra seicentosessantasei

5220670 dovendosi compiere allora tutte queste cose carissimi essendo stata divisa in due parti la settimana cfr daniele cap 9 essendosi manifestato l abominio della desolazione lanticristo avendo i due profeti e precursori del signore terminato la loro missione ed avvicinandosi infine lintero mondo alla fine cosa resta se non la venuta dal cielo del nostro signore e salvatore ges cristo che noi abbiamo atteso con speranza egli porter la conflagrazione e il giusto giudizio su tutti coloro che non hanno voluto credere in lui
5220671 il regno del seduttore ed anticristo verr rapidamente soppresso e poi alla fine in un batter docchio le cose di questo mondo passeranno il potere delluomo sar cancellato e tutte le cose visibili saranno distrutte
5220672 bisogna che si sappia che deve venire lanticristo anticristo in verit chiunque non riconosce che il figlio di dio venne nella carne che dio perfetto e divenne uomo perfetto essendo al tempo stesso dio tuttavia in un senso particolare e speciale colui che deve venire alla consumazione del mondo lanticristo quindi necessario che prima il vangelo sia proclamato a tutte le genti come il signore ha detto e allora egli verr per convincere gli empi ebrei
5220673 prima che il giudizio finale di dio abbia introdotto il regno eterno dei santi il regno dellanticristo attaccher la chiesa ferocemente anche se per breve tempo
5220674 dunque nega o dubita che lultimo giudizio avverr come preannunziato nei citati libri della bibbia se non colui che per non saprei quale incredibile malanimo o ignoranza non crede in essi sebbene abbiano gi segnalato la propria veridicit al mondo intero abbiamo appreso che in quel giudizio o attorno a quel giudizio si verificheranno questi avvenimenti la venuta di elia di tesbe la fede dei giudei la persecuzione dellanticristo il giudizio di cristo la risurrezione dei morti la discriminazione di buoni e cattivi il cataclisma del mondo e la sua rinascita si deve credere che si avranno tutti questi avvenimenti ma in quali misure e con quale successione si verifichino lo insegner pi la realt dei fatti di quanto attualmente riesce a raggiungere alla perfezione il pensiero umano ritengo per che si avvereranno nella successione da me indicata
5220675 lanticristo di cui abbiamo parlato verr per quando limpero romano avr esaurito il suo tempo e sar ormai vicina la fine del mondo
5220676 allora il signore dal suo glorioso cielo stabilir la sua pace e sorger il regno dei romani e stabilir il suo dominio sulla terra fino ai suoi confini estremi e non ci sar alcuno che gli resister successivamente dilagata e tutte le creature saranno diventate corrotte allora apparir la giustizia divina che distrugger interamente la gente e luomo di iniquit lanticristo sar rivelato sulla terra il seduttore degli uomini e lagitatore di tutta la terra
5220677 nello stesso modo in cui furono distrutti quei regni quello dei babilonesi dai persiani quello dei persiani dai greci quello dei greci dai romani che erano esistiti prima dellimpero romano cos
5220678 dichiariamo ci che gli autori ecclesiastici ci hanno tramandato alla consumazione del mondo quando il regno dei romani sar stato distrutto quando dieci re avranno diviso fra di loro il territorio dei romani ne sorger un undicesimo re da un piccolo regno quando questultimo cio lanticristo avr vinto tre dei dieci re gli altri sette re si assoggetteranno al vincitore
5220679 giovanni il discepolo del signore nellapocalisse ha parlato di ci che accadr negli ultimi tempi e dei
5220680 avocher a s lintero dominio delle terre distrugger tutti i templi dei falsi dei ed esiger il battesimo di tutti i pagani
5220681 la croce di cristo sar eretta su tutti i templi
5220682 a gerusalemme e l deponendo il suo diadema consegner a dio padre e a suo figlio ges cristo il regno cristiano
5220683 in ogni periodo di tribolazione dio ha aiutato la sua chiesa e lo far anche nel tempo che precede la venuta dellanticristo egli innalzer dal cuore della sua chiesa un sovrano cristiano il grande monarca che compir le pi mirabili gesta con laiuto divino questo regnante non soltanto riporter alla vera fede le anime che vivono in errore ma impartir anche un colpo pesante sui nemici dellimpero i turchi scaccer il loro impero e ristabilir il cristianesimo
5220684 il sesto periodo inizier con il potente monarca e il pontefice santo
5220685 allora il figlio di dio nostro signore ges cristo verr in persona apparir sulle nubi del cielo circondato da legioni di angeli e risplendente di gloria metter a morte lanticristo la bestia il nemico il seduttore e tutti i suoi seguaci questa sar la fine dei tempi e linizio del giudizio generale

5220702 in the past 20 to 30 years researchers have been able to shrink the size of devices and the size of the patterns that you need to make those devices following the use of the same types of lithographic materials tools and strategies only getting better and better at it
5220703 theres information encoded in the molecules that results in getting certain size and spacing of features with certain desirable properties
5220704 thermodynamic driving forces make the structures more uniform in size and higher density than you can obtain with the traditional materials
5220705 if you only have to pattern every fourth spot you can write those patterns at a fraction of the time and expense
5220706 this research addresses one of the most significant challenges to delivering patterned media the mass production of patterned disks in high volume at a reasonable cost
5220707 the large potential gains in density offered by patterned media make it one of the most promising new technologies on the horizon for future hard disk drives
5220708 these results have profound implications for advancing the performance and capabilities of lithographic materials and processes beyond current limits

5220710 most beneficiaries will see a premium increase in their current plan there will be some significant increases
5220711 first there is a trend in prescription drug cost growth generally prices tend to increase because of price increases for existing drugs the growth in the average number of prescriptions per person and the introduction of new drugs
5220712 so they have adjusted their 2009 bids to reflect those higher than anticipated costs
5220713 in addition 97 percent of people in stand alone prescription drug plans will have access to a 2009 plan with equal or lower cost premiums than their 2008 plan
5220714 moreover many medicare beneficiaries will have access to a medicare advantage plan that offers lower prescription drug premiums than a stand alone plan
5220715 we are paying for better outcomes and we are getting higher quality and more value for the medicare dollar
5220716 and these results show that by working in collaboration with the physician groups on new and innovative ways to reimburse for high quality care we are on the right track to find a better way to pay physicians

5220794 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5220795 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5220796 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5220797 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5220798 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5220799 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5220800 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action

5220803 i know its all wrong by rights we shouldnt even be here but we are its like in the great stories mr frodo the ones that really matter full of darkness and danger they were and sometimes you didnt want to know the end because how could the end be happy how could the world go back to the way it was with so much bad happened but in the end it is only a passing thing this shadow even darkness must pass a new day will come and when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer those were the stories that stay with you that meant something even if you were too small to understand why but i think mr frodo i do understand i know now folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didnt they kept going because they were holding on to something
5220804 that theres some good in this world mr frodo and its worth fighting for
5220805 tropical storm fay poses some risks to the oil and gas production in the gulf
5220806 simply cant undo in one budget what has taken 12 years to develop
5220807 im very happy to be number one but the feeling doesnt change too much because the last years i did very well too
5220808 i was very happy being the number two so finally im number one for sure theres satisfaction but at the same time i dont know i dont have time to celebrate i play new york in one week
5220809 weve put a full stop today on the sonny bill williams file weve placed this chapter into the clubs history and archives
5220810 as far as im concerned the book on sonny bill williams is now closed
5220811 the clubs received a significant payout one of the biggest in the history of australian sport
5220812 im happy that weve got a full stop on it theres no winners in this saga
5220813 the bulldogs have lost a player theyve developed since the age of 16 one of the best players to come through our club the game has lost one of its significant profiles and for sonny bill himself hes made some decisions that hell have to live with for the rest of his life
5220814 theres no fairytale ending at the end of this theres no one running around the bulldogs club yelling and screaming with delight this is actually a relatively sad day
5220815 i was willing to go a lot more its all good 750 we can stop there
5220816 thats not our plan wed like to be able to spend that sort of money
5220817 theres no ready made fix to actually spend that money at the moment
5220818 well be looking for players were in the market now

5220822 we are going to help rebuild georgia into a strong georgian state
5220823 the russians will have failed in their effort to undermine georgia and we will be looking at what we can do with the states around that region as well
5220824 there is a ceasefire and russia is currently not in compliance with this ceasefire
5220825 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to

5220829 a qualitative review of the studies found a consistent and strong association between the exposure to fluoride and low iq
5220830 this new brain research together with the nrcs evidence of fluorides thyroid and bone damage and the cdcs recommendation against use of fluoridated water in infant formula as well as the national kidney foundations withdrawal of their fluoridation support makes a strong case for ending this 60 year old fluoridation experiment
5220831 there have now been over 40 animal studies which show that fluoride can damage the brain and no less than 18 studies which show that fluoride lowers iq in children and only 2 that dont
5220832 its apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain
5220833 the weight of evidence thats on the table now says that on a precautionary basis we should stop this practice fluoridation
5220834 the canadian dental association says there is no evidence to support the claims that fluoride in drinking water can lead to lower iqs
5220835 the majority of dental professionals surveyed were unaware of the current understanding of fluorides predominant posteruptive mode of action
5220836 no child is or ever was fluoride deficient in fact the u s centers for disease control tells us that 1 3 of u s school children are fluoride overdosed causing dental fluorosis white spotted yellow brown and or pitted teeth its time to stop fluoridation

5220842 taken together we suggest that symbiodinium clade a is less beneficial to corals than other symbiodinium lineages and may be more representative of a parasitic than a mutualistic symbiont whereby the animal host does not receive sufficient nutritional input from the dinoflagellate symbiont a circumstance that ultimately renders the coral more susceptible to disease and mortality
5220843 have moved across almost half the globe with their timing and locations coinciding with major tectonic events
5220844 everything is set for the champions trophy to be held in pakistan and the icc fully supports our security plans and planning it is only a few players who are grumbling and their concerns are emotional pressure not based on reasoning or logic
5220845 i would advise these players to not be stubborn and behave sensibly
5220846 the icc and its member boards are satisfied with our security arrangements and foolproof planning and there is no reason for not having the champions trophy in pakistan
5220847 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5220848 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5220849 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know

5220867 eighty one per cent say when making an important decision government leaders should pay attention to public opinion polls because this will help them get a sense of the publics views
5220868 whether they think that elections are the only time when the views of the people should have influence or that also between elections leaders should consider the views of the people as they make decisions an extraordinary 94 per cent say that government leaders should pay attention to the views of the public between elections

5220874 nuclear weapons free zone in the middle east that would include both islamic countries and israel

5220891 in a short time we caught hundreds of species of animals 10 of which may be new to science it was unreal unbelievable
5220892 catching is the easy bit the hard bit is going back to the lab and examining the species comparing them to collections and books seeing if they are new to science one hour in the field can equal hundreds of hours in the lab
5220893 i see kate humble who dives on the shallower reefs in the new series is now described as a
5220894 i throughly enjoyed both programmes especially pacific abyss because i love seeing fish that i and others keep in there natural enviroment
5220895 lost land of the jaguar was outstanding i definitely prefer the wildlife documentaries which show the human side of field biology rather than the ones based on pure wildlife cinematography must watch pacific abyss on iplayer tonight
5220896 we trust that there will be a conclusion very soon
5220897 there are issues that are outstanding but quite clearly one has no business in negotiating if you are not prepared to compromise
5220898 it is critical that we conclude this dialogue as a matter of urgency
5220899 i knew i had to play my butt off just to make it up there for the barclays i didnt want four weeks off and im glad i at least got into the first one im ecstatic
5220900 at uc berkeley ee100 is the introduction to electrical engineering class for non ee majors the goal of this course is to serve as a hands on electronics class we use multisim in the ee100 course because it is easy to use and abstracts the messy details of spice multisim also provides very useful features like the breadboard tool and instruments like the multimeter we can show students how to wire an ammeter without blowing fuses multisim also integrates with labview and this helps our students compare simulation data to experimental data
5220901 for me federer is still technically the best he is the best player in the history of tennis
5220902 if federer can improve i can too for sure i can improve the serve 100 percent i can improve my volley im happy but its important to be humble if you want to continue improving
5220903 nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year
5220904 the feeling for sure is very happy for being no 1 but the feeling doesnt change too much because the last years i did very well too it is a satisfaction i want to enjoy these two days probably but later i have to be focused on new york for the us open
5220905 theres no different pressure now im number one it doesnt change ill probably be number two in a few months you never know
5220906 last season he won impressively first time at carlisle and i feel that took the edge off him for newbury so hell not have a prep this time
5220907 with a chaser rated as high as him youd expect to to be close to top weight in a hennessy but with denman in the line up hell be around 3lb out of the handicap
5220908 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
5220909 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
5220910 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
5220911 in the summer of 2007 as arctic sea ice reached a record low the northwest passage opened between baffin bay and mcclure strait also known as mclure strait passing through parry channel this opening would be the route through the arctic most conducive to large scale shipping as of early august 2008 arctic sea ice was not expected to set a new melt record although its extent was well below the long term average whether the northwest passage would open as far north as it did the previous year remained in question but the sea ice in a more southerly route one taken by norwegian explorer roald amundsen in the early twentieth century had begun to melt
5220912 pete your just a denier the register didnt just make numbers up out of thin air they based on research from people who you know actually study the climate once again this doesnt fit your meme and mindset im hear to free ideologs like you and brian from your mind set

5220916 theres nothing like taking a nice quiet bomb apart to steady the nerves
5220917 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
5220918 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
5220919 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
5220920 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5220921 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
5220922 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
5220923 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
5220924 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5220925 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5220926 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
5220927 when you are able to read a 444 page book in only a couple of days it is usually a sign of an engrossing and enjoyable read and this is the case with days of atonement this novel is all about immersing the reader in the historical period and keeping you guessing till the end with its many red herrings
5220928 we might have to bring a few young players back in this week because if you do lose or you are not playing well at least youre gaining something from it
5220929 theres not a lot to be gained from losing with the same sort of team
5220930 at least this year weve introduced a lot of new players
5220931 its all relative if we dont make the eight and we blood some young kids thats a positive
5220932 if you make the eight and you havent blooded any kids and you finish in the first week of the finals whats better
5220933 i think every team sets out to make the eight at the start of the year and we are still in the mix so thats a real important factor at this time of the year
5220934 i would certainly rather be playing in games that definitely have a degree of pressure and then the young guys who are playing them are learning something
5220935 the cupboard is a little bit bare in terms of weve got a lot of rookies but they cant all play
5220936 with that sort of injury he was told not to fly so hell be assessed by our doctors when he gets back

5220943 not my problem the care and treatment of mr g
5220944 instead of responding to the person we typically react to the behaviour
5220945 we want the facts to fit the preconceptions when they dont it is easier to ignore the facts than to change the preconceptions
5220946 displays aggression and sexual disinhibition in keeping with his behaviour over several years
5220947 extensive contact with the psychiatric services over the last forty years
5220948 has not brought about any modification in his behaviour there is a danger that further treatment will just foster dependence and encourage further sexual deviance
5220949 doctors get yourselves and your own houses in order first before you dare to criticise those who suffer and come to you for help your job is to help us if you cant do your job because you are incompetent or prejudiced then for gods sake get out and do something else where you will do less harm
5220950 if i were king i would send all the flemings to wallonia and all the walloons to flanders for six months like military service they would live with a family and that would solve all our ethnic and linguistic problems very fast because everybodys tooth aches in the same way everybody loves their mother everybody loves or hates spinach and those are the things that really count

5220955 can he get the title for liverpool as ronaldo did last season why not
5220956 of course they are different players ronaldo comes in from the side but fernando is a real striker he has everything to be the best player this season
5220957 there was nothing on when he got the ball but he scores a few goals like that he is always looking for the target and as soon as he gets space to shoot he shoots and often scores
5220958 fernando played wonderfully at the euros and always when you need him he scores very important goals
5220959 he is a top quality player and for me he is the best striker in the world if you are speaking about a real striker he is the pinnacle he is everything not only in normal games but more often than not in special games

5220962 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
5220963 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
5220964 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists
5220965 if nothing is done all the polar bears could die in our lifetime
5220966 science keeps getting stronger and the mathematical models keep getting better
5220967 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate

5220969 expert scientists disagreed on the key contributor to global warming at a senate environment and public works committee hearing roy w spencer former nasa scientist during the clinton administration attributes the majority of global warming contributions to errors in measurement spencer claimed that the clinton administration told him what he could and could not say to congress about global warming and greenhouse emissions chairwoman barbara boxer d calif cited spencers blog where he admits that the clinton administration never told him what was and was not permissible to say to congress
5220970 few seem to realise that the present ipcc models predict almost unanimously that by 2040 the average summer in europe will be as hot as the summer of 2003 when over 30 000 died from heat by then we may cool ourselves with air conditioning and learn to live in a climate no worse than that of baghdad now but without extensive irrigation the plants will die and both farming and natural ecosystems will be replaced by scrub and desert what will there be to eat

5221005 the downturn in our financial market place this year has reaffirmed the need to maintain a robust portfolio
5221006 we both have common business interests that need to be explored further in order to achieve a competitive edge that will benefit both parties
5221007 regardless of a difference of opinion it is unacceptable that those who are involved in whaling get injured or face life threatening dangers it is to my understanding that the international community will agree on our position
5221008 opposing the research is one thing but physical threats against whaling ships must be restrained

5221012 i cant speculate on what mr glenn took from that conversation but i did not believe i in any way indicated anything other than payment of tauranga electoral petition fees
5221013 aligned the fact he was paying for the tauranga electoral petition with the political party whose leader ran it
5221014 the position is i have not rendered a fee note to the solicitor for the work done and that solicitor has not rendered a bill to winston until my instructing solicitor renders a bill to winston there is no debt owed by winston
5221015 we have always operated under an agreed system of mr henry not disclosing the source of fund raising and myself not asking there is no debt to be paid or discharged
5221016 when you were saying this is a donation to you you were accepting that there was a donation to you personally
5221017 no it was a donation to the legal cost of a petition

5221048 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
5221049 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5221050 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al

5221060 engr okoye contacted me through telephone in february 2007 and offered to engage the consultancy services of our global media limited a firm where he is the ceo special projects director and consequent upon the discussion arrived enugu in march 2007 and accepted two briefs from engr
5221061 the first brief was successfully executed and lasted for four months march april may amp june 2007 while the second brief lasted for three months july 8 october 10 2007 and was equally satisfactorily implemented
5221062 all is now set for the annual international event we are expecting west and east african countries to deliberate on the national building material policy
5221063 is to create a policy direction for building materials so as to give credibility and certification to the materials we are not happy with the frequency of building collapse across the country we are out to address the situation once and for all first of all we want consumers of building materials to be sensitised on the quality and quantity needed for each category of structure we want them to patronise only professionals the activities of quacks and other non professionals is alarming and we cannot sit down and watch innocent lives destroyed
5221064 all i can remember was that a trailer lost control in its attempt to overtake and was moving towards me then i found myself here
5221065 the hospital management told me that a good samaritan brought me at about 8 am to the hospital after the incident
5221066 hands on espresso training experience designed to energize partners and transform the customer experience
5221067 we are not in the coffee business serving people we are in the people business serving coffee
5221068 its been quite interesting just as it is also challenging especially when one loves his job
5221069 but in all im highly disturbed that the level of awareness of the veterinary profession is stil low i am particularly pained that the practitioners of veterinary medicine are not being given sufficient recognition compared to what is obtainable in developed countries regrettably we live in a country where you have to undergo the burden of blowing your own trumpet for people to know that you exist veterinary doctors are by nature silent achievers they dont make noise about their attainments but gradually i think we are improving on our public relations especially under the present leadership no doubt about the fact that the challenges are really there in terms of personnel and equipment in hospitals
5221070 quite interesting i am passionate about it what many people are not conscious of is the fact that animals live in the same environment as humans and the implication of their health problems has a capacity to take a huge toll on human health
5221071 lots of diseases can be contacted from animals so taking care of their health is as good as treating humans of their ailments
5221072 unknown to many people most of the health care solutions started with the veterinary profession
5221073 for instance the first ceaserian operation was carried out by a veterinary doctor dr yomori a veterinary doctor has done a lot concerning lassa fever vaccine lots of vaccine production could be traced to veterinary doctors and all these have brought a lot of prestige to the profession all over the world ironically we are mostly appreciated outside the country but we are not doing badly in nigeria too our problem in nigeria essentially borders on awareness people are more interested in human health than animals ignorant of the fact that there are more than 500 diseases you can contact from animals and this is the more reason why we should be collaborative in our practices we just have to give optimum attention to both animal and human health care there are lots of people today being wrongly treated for diseases contacted from animals it is sad that at this stage we are still confronted with this kind of deficiency people only know about rabies because it involves dogs
5221074 in my own opinion we are moving rather too slow we need to overhaul our health care delivery system by declaring a state of emergency in the health sector we need to build to and sustain our hospitals at global standards
5221075 we need to establish a veterinary clinic in each of the local government areas of the federation before spreading then down to the village level
5221076 we also need to do a lot of researchs to be abreast of events
5221077 i believe its a passing phase we shall come out of it when we get to that level at times we do have good plans but we lack the political will to execute them accordingly
5221078 we want a situation whereby the electorate will be allowed to elect its right candidates not a situation whereby the ruling government will impose candidates on us look at what happened in bauchi state where the state electoral commission disqualified our candidates at the late hours and seven of our local government chairmanship candidates where denied their right by the commission so the government and the commission have really disappointed us
5221079 it appears a cowardly attack the offender has walked straight up to the person there has been very little altercation or conversation and theres been one big king hit inspector rod kemp told reporters in brisbane
5221080 it appears that its merely been a case of someones backed in and taken a bowser ahead of someone else insp kemp said
5221081 given the current forecast as a precautionary measure we will continue to reduce offshore staffing levels shell said
5221082 there remains no impact to shell operated production at this time
5221083 additional personnel being evacuated today are not essential to current ongoing drilling and production operations
5221084 a ministerial commission which met today approved the list of 200 palestinian prisoners who are to be released as a goodwill gesture toward palestinian president mahmud abbas said prime minister ehud olmerts spokesman mark regev

5221086 abu ali yatta who has been behind bars since 1979 for killing an israeli student
5221087 step in the right direction but said the palestinians had hoped to see more freed
5221088 his blood showed high levels of testosterone although they were below the maximum admissible levels the volleyball federation decided to take an extra precaution and remove him from the match
5221089 if the bulgarian team decided to let him go i think it was a wise decision
5221090 if the federation had certain doubts if he could be found positive this could hurt the chances of the bulgarian team
5221091 under fivb rules for indoor volleyball if an athlete tests positive following a match the team could lose the match regardless of the end results acosta said and if two athletes on a team test positive the team could be removed from the tournament he explained
5221092 very often it is not the individual it is the doctor or some other person who is pushing to get some kind of advantage
5221093 many of our federations have asked us to support womens boxing in the olympics we hope well soon have the women competing there
5221094 aibas womens committee will present the proposal to the ioc and committee chair joyce bowen echoes wus anticipation of success when the ioc decides in december
5221095 were looking forward to it the time has been there for a long while we were just waiting but weve been ready long enough
5221096 what we have done i think the ioc family witnessed
5221097 weve made a lot of reform and changes and weve also demonstrated fair judging in the olympics
5221098 judging reform has been a cornerstone of wus presidency starting with an immediate effort two years ago to root out judges long rumored to be ethically compromised
5221099 i have a lot more things to achieve besides the world championships and the olympic games
5221100 it is really a miracle for zhang ning to retain the olympic gold her entrance to the beijing olympic games was even in doubt two months ago
5221101 there was a period when badminton in korea was very disappointing and it felt like the world had stopped i feel elated about this achievement
5221102 this is to show that something good can come out of the ghetto ghetto cant hold you back as long as you have ambition
5221103 in school many people see track as a means of gaining an academic scholarship there is also more to it

5221116 upward pressure on inflation is likely to continue throughout the year largely due to rising food prices and elevated oil prices the indian government recently raised retail fuel prices by around 10 per cent and we expect there is more to come
5221117 we believe wpi inflation will remain in double digit territory until may 2009 we expect wpi inflation of 17 per cent by september 2008

5221127 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5221128 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5221129 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5221130 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5221131 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5221132 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5221133 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5221134 whatever you give a woman shes going to multiply if you give her sperm shell give you a baby if you give her a house shell give you a home if you give her groceries shell give you a meal if you give her a smile shell give you her heart she multiplies and enlarges what is given to her

5221139 wir brauchen konkrete aussagen von welchem bedarf der staat ausgeht deshalb fordern wir einen ausbauplan und einen stufenplan
5221140 die st dte und gemeinden brauchen klarheit welche leistungen der freistaat f r die ganztagsschule erbringt wir wollen wissen welche ausgaben auf uns zukommen und welche unterst tzung uns der staat gibt

5221145 we will ask the leadership of the russian federation for there to be a russian military base on the territory of south ossetia because russian citizens live here
5221146 we will ask the russian leadership it is their decision
5221147 international observers will no longer be present on the territory of south ossetia
5221148 we have no confidence in these international observers in these people who corrupt the truth

5221158 we are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast it would simply be an impossible task both in financial terms and engineering terms
5221159 british businesses are already being squeezed by the rising cost of raw materials and weakening export prospects in the slowing european market despite a weaker pound
5221160 these pressures together with the bleak outlook for domestic growth are taking an inevitable toll on firms confidence in their own ability to do business
5221161 any horses who have breathing problems lose at least seven pounds of ability but he gave us a great day in the st leger and now hes won a listed race and two group threes this season
5221162 a lot of things havent gone right for him but he has hardly put a foot wrong his defeat at royal ascot came because my stable was out of sorts at the time
5221163 hes a brave tough horse he got quite far back but when johnny asked for an effort he pulled it out
5221164 last season he won impressively first time at carlisle and i feel that took the edge off him for newbury so hell not have a prep this time
5221165 with a chaser rated as high as him youd expect to to be close to top weight in a hennessy but with denman in the line up hell be around 3lb out of the handicap
5221166 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5221167 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5221168 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5221169 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5221170 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5221171 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5221172 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5221173 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5221174 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5221175 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5221176 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5221177 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5221178 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months

5221191 god made adam and eve and they had children and so mankind gt was made
5221192 many years ago there were monkeys from which the human gt race evolved
5221193 mom how is it possible that gt you told me the human race was created by god and dad said they developed from gt monkeys
5221194 well dear it is very simple i told you about my side of
5221195 for me federer is still technically the best he is the best player in the history of tennis
5221196 if federer can improve i can too for sure i can improve the serve 100 percent i can improve my volley im happy but its important to be humble if you want to continue improving
5221197 nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year
5221198 the feeling for sure is very happy for being no 1 but the feeling doesnt change too much because the last years i did very well too it is a satisfaction i want to enjoy these two days probably but later i have to be focused on new york for the us open
5221199 theres no different pressure now im number one it doesnt change ill probably be number two in a few months you never know
5221200 the two of us are different he is a man and i am a lady there is a very big age gap between us and we differ a lot in the way we present ourselves and talk
5221201 i am angered because when you read the story the tone reflects that i am not in nrm by conviction but by coercion but i am there by conviction and i will continue pointing out the mistakes of the party
5221202 i said that when somebody points out mistakes in the nrm that person is called a multipartist i also noted that we all belong to the nrm but we can never have similar views
5221203 can he get the title for liverpool as ronaldo did last season why not
5221204 of course they are different players ronaldo comes in from the side but fernando is a real striker he has everything to be the best player this season
5221205 there was nothing on when he got the ball but he scores a few goals like that he is always looking for the target and as soon as he gets space to shoot he shoots and often scores
5221206 fernando played wonderfully at the euros and always when you need him he scores very important goals
5221207 he is a top quality player and for me he is the best striker in the world if you are speaking about a real striker he is the pinnacle he is everything not only in normal games but more often than not in special games
5221208 the man who swims like a fish but looks like a horse
5221209 o sil ncio da l der do psd muito mais ruidoso do que o barulho dos profissionais da conversa fiada
5221210 i knew i had to play my butt off just to make it up there for the barclays i didnt want four weeks off and im glad i at least got into the first one im ecstatic
5221211 ashley has been fantastic for us im pleased gabby and john have signed new contracts and weve got a couple more players that we are looking to do exactly the same with with ashley young being one of them
5221212 we are in conversation about that i dont think the chairman randy lerner has any major problem about sorting out wages for people if they are doing the business week in and week out on the pitch
5221213 agbonlahor has done that in my two seasons here carew has been terrific since being swapped with milan baros at lyon and young has been absolute class
5221214 it means he will get a new contract ashley hasnt come and asked for anything
5221215 he has got a number of years left to run on his contract but id like to sort him out and i am sure he is enjoying his football here which is great
5221216 if he continues to play in the fashion he is for us who knows what might happen to him in the future but we would be delighted to keep him a bit longer
5221217 as far as england is concerned his agbonlahors time will come today was a great start for him
5221218 i was a bit surprised that ashley young wasnt in the squad but his time will come as well ive no doubts whatsoever that will happen
5221219 american higher education does not need a barrage of new regulations imposing new costs so someone in washington can try to figure out how to improve the harvard classics department and nashville auto diesel college both of whose students are eligible for federal grants and loans i believe the overregulation of higher education is the greatest deterrent to maintaining its quality and that autonomy competition and choice are the greatest incentives to excellence

5221223 we wanted to put the desk staff in the middle of the room
5221224 the baby boomers are the segment that everyone has been chasing for the past 20 years
5221225 gen y is a market of comparable size theres a big aha when hotels discover that
5221226 if you were designing a new concept it would be logical to appeal to the high propensity consumer
5221227 theyre interested in things that are a lot less traditional things that have much greater personality and the experiences that are a little less predictable
5221228 which is why design has become the primary basis of differentiation for these lifestyle hotels they dont want stuff that looks like it was all shipped out of the same warehouse in north carolina
5221229 i just get the sense with obama that he has a clear set priorities in his own mind that have nothing to do with ups and downs of the campaign
5221230 he doesnt need someone who is young but its got to be someone who is not part of the baby boom partisan of the 1990s
5221231 the vice presidential pick is always more about telling voters what kind of a potential president the nominee will be and its even more important for obama than it has been for past nominees
5221232 obamas central challenge in this election is to make a certain group of voters comfortable with him in terms of who he is as it relates to being able to do the job and the vice presidential pick along with the convention and debates stands as one of the three tent foundation events in the general to connect with voters about who he is
5221233 more confrontational about that issue than and more adamant about discriminating against gay people
5221234 look theres no way this is going to happen but ive been getting this weird feeling that he might pick her
5221235 if they were trying to fool us to have us rule her out completely to maximize the this be the way that they do it
5221236 that shes not particularly interested in this at all and has really moved on
5221237 ashley has been fantastic for us im pleased gabby and john have signed new contracts and weve got a couple more players that we are looking to do exactly the same with with ashley young being one of them
5221238 we are in conversation about that i dont think the chairman randy lerner has any major problem about sorting out wages for people if they are doing the business week in and week out on the pitch
5221239 agbonlahor has done that in my two seasons here carew has been terrific since being swapped with milan baros at lyon and young has been absolute class
5221240 it means he will get a new contract ashley hasnt come and asked for anything
5221241 he has got a number of years left to run on his contract but id like to sort him out and i am sure he is enjoying his football here which is great
5221242 if he continues to play in the fashion he is for us who knows what might happen to him in the future but we would be delighted to keep him a bit longer
5221243 as far as england is concerned his agbonlahors time will come today was a great start for him
5221244 i was a bit surprised that ashley young wasnt in the squad but his time will come as well ive no doubts whatsoever that will happen
5221245 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5221246 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
5221247 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
5221248 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
5221249 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
5221250 just so you all know we did set a record
5221251 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5221252 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5221253 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
5221254 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
5221255 recycling is recycling glass should be included its not about making money its about making difference

5221260 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5221261 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
5221262 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment

5221269 i dont want to miss anything thats okay isnt it
5221270 i guess so i just hate how i sound on tape you know
5221271 its okay people will be reading the interview the recording is just for me
5221272 he owns dozens of my pics has them hanging all over the house its sort of embarrassing
5221273 yeah except hed never call it that hed say he was just being discrete
5221274 he isnt marching in any pride parades or anything but hes open about being gay now i couldnt be with him if he was still hiding
5221275 i said maybe we should wait and see if it becomes legal in this state
5221276 suppose for a minute that gay marriage became legal here in pennsylvania tomorrow then what
5221277 i love jimmy and he loves me we dont need some piece of paper to make that real
5221278 i thought i was but it wasnt the real thing not like this

5221280 the french call it coup de foudre a clap of thunder
5221281 i dont i took it in high school but coup de foudre is about the only thing that stuck besides all that ballet terminology
5221282 what about kids do you ever see yourselves as parents
5221283 you ought to know since you wrote the love scenes
5221284 i know what you meant were pretty much equal partners in everything
5221285 jimmy is strong in some ways and im strong in others so we balance each other thats the way it should be i think we dont live the d s lifestyle or anything so dominance isnt really an issue
5221286 ive seen pictures of you where you look like the perfect submissive
5221287 thats just pretend its my job to make it look real but its just an illusion
5221288 yeah jason and shannon are both dominant and they really live the life though jason isnt with anybody right now
5221289 what about that theres a scene in the novel where you needle benny pretty hard about his crush on jason anything happening there
5221290 no the slave master is in the other story you should get yourself an assistant to help keep this stuff straight
5221291 i know but jason and benny need my help otherwise they might never get together

5221297 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5221298 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5221299 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5221300 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5221301 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5221302 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5221303 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5221304 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5221305 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5221306 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5221307 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5221308 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5221309 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

5221336 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
5221337 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5221338 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5221339 its been almost seven years since i wrote my first animation book animation magic and what i really wanted to do this time was write a book about the making of animated films in the modern age for a slightly older audience i think this book is for everybody people who love animation people who are intrigued by the process but most of all people who just love movies

5221346 if there is anything that infuriates the establishment of san francisco it is any mention of religion particularly a christian one
5221347 governor huckabees ignorant and provocative reference to christianity is repugnant
5221348 they can only be seen as intended to harm we urge him to apologize and we hope that this will be the last of such hurtful comments
5221349 if there is anything that we as americans cannot tolerate it is discussion of religion
5221350 as a public figure governor huckabee has a duty to recognize our founding fathers role in abolishing religion from the american way of life
5221351 we opposed the running of these ads from the onset for reasons that are now abundantly clear as a media outlet we were charged with predicting how our audience would react once we concluded that this particular story may anger some of our audience we decided to take the ethical and responsible route as a media outlet we chose to stifle free speech

5221360 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
5221361 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
5221362 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
5221363 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5221364 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5221365 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions

5221370 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5221371 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5221372 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5221373 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5221374 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5221375 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5221376 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5221377 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5221378 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5221379 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5221380 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done

5221396 during this summit we have taken important decisions and what is left now is for troika of sadc to do everything in its power to implement these decisions
5221397 this shows seriousness and appreciation with which we take this issue further the organ will continue working in this matter and i believe that decisions taken should be of great benefit to the people and government of zimbabwe
5221398 on behalf of our government i would like to thank member states for showing their confidence in hosting the summit in drc we will do everything in our power to make sure that the summit becomes of high success
5221399 as sadc we encourage and appeal to the parties to sign any outstanding agreements and conclude the negotiations as a matter of urgency in order to restore political stability in zimbabwe
5221400 the decision will certainly have to come from zimbabwean people the parties know what is best for them
5221401 i am quite sure that zimbabwe leaders will do what they think is required for that country
5221402 it is critically important that any solution taken should be a product owned by the entire population of zimbabwe
5221403 this is critically important because any solution that is imposed from outside will not last unless it is a common product that is owned by this entire collective of the leadership of zimbabwe
5221404 the mdc welcomes the fact that the talks will continue as it quite evident from the sadc chairperson that the dialogue will continue under the framework of the memorandum of understanding that was signed on 25 july 2008 by the principals
5221405 we are fully and fairly committed to this dialogue and we trust that a conclusion will be reached soon

5221411 today we can say with pride that our collective efforts have borne fruits and that we have successfully met the objective we set ourselves indeed it required hard work dedication resolve and an unswerving commitment to mobilise our limited resources so as to meet our objective
5221412 we must intensify our collective efforts to build and diversify the regions productive capacity to expand the range of products that can be traded

5221417 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
5221418 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
5221419 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
5221420 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5221421 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5221422 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5221423 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5221424 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5221425 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5221426 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5221427 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5221428 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5221429 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5221430 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5221431 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5221432 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5221433 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5221434 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5221435 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5221436 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5221437 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5221438 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5221439 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5221440 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5221441 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5221442 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5221443 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5221444 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5221445 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5221446 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5221447 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5221448 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5221449 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5221450 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks

5221455 we are honored to be recognized for our local contributions and look forward to continuing to partner with austin schools agencies and non profit organizations to help meet the needs of our community
5221456 this means everything to come back from all the heartache and prove to myself i can be number one

5221458 the main thing about child health checks is that in of themselves they will not improve the health of that child
5221459 and as far as were aware for the massive amounts of money that have been spent performing the child health checks there has been massive duplication so very few children have been identified who werent previously known

5221467 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5221468 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5221469 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5221470 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5221471 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5221472 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5221473 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5221474 in a quick and stunningly pro active response to kamal hassans comments about the oscars the tamil film industry has instituted a new award that will honour accomplishments in areas that are important to local sensibilities and context
5221475 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
5221476 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
5221477 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
5221478 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
5221479 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5221480 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5221481 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5221482 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5221483 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5221484 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5221485 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
5221486 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
5221487 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5221488 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
5221489 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
5221490 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
5221491 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
5221492 the scotland rural development programme srdp is one of the most forward thinking innovative rural investment programmes in the world
5221493 our goal is to build a place that will compete with the largest convention centers in europe
5221494 at present anyone who wants to hold a car or construction equipment exhibition for example cannot use the existing corridor space so the center must be expanded to meet potential exhibitors needs
5221495 a subway station will be built beneath the icc to make the center accessible to all forms of transportation just like other such centers around the world the plaza between the icc and the central bus station will be redesigned to include cafes and restaurants creating a continuum of the centers open space
5221496 many different styles and abilities will be on display this year the society is open to every one of any age across the fylde and we hope to exhibit the broad range of talent we have in the exhibition
5221497 hopefully people will see that they too can turn their hand to photography as it is a very rewarding hobby as you are constantly looking for subjects improving upon your last photo and encouraging others along the way
5221498 with the digital revolution many people now have access to cameras like never before photography is no longer messy or time consuming but is accessible to all with many creative opportunities
5221499 everyone comments on what a friendly group we are we have guest speakers themed nights and a different photographic topic each week
5221500 we have also seen lots of new female members join as in the past photographic clubs were largely male dominated
5221501 whether they are professional or beginner images there is wide range of different image on display for the public to enjoy
5221502 i feel weve been distancing ourselves from each other recently we arent very intimate lately lets try to discuss why this is happening
5221503 i know that there is a lot on your mind and that work and other factors are putting high amounts of stress on both of us is it possible that this may be affecting our sex life
5221504 its kind of like one of my bosses won the championship
5221505 it was special to win this tournament growing up here
5221506 i think 25 000 is about the number we can handle out here
5221507 its all going to be over within a couple of hours
5221508 thank you for letting it come back its something special
5221509 this is the first place i was ever exposed to the pga tour i loved it
5221510 its phenomenal what a great boost the tournament has been for businesses in the area
5221511 its an absolute disgrace these stars have given their heart and soul to
5221512 bettys nearly 90 eileen and barbara are in their seventies and malcolm hebden is 68 instead of being rewarded for their contribution they are being treated little better than extras
5221513 im only in the bill until october then its finished

5221515 she has chosen not to renew her contract when it ends later this year
5221516 louisa has decided to move on after two years to try new things
5221517 it seem to me that most people prefer soft baked chocolate chip cookies rather than hard ones
5221518 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5221519 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5221520 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5221521 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
5221522 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5221523 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5221524 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5221525 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5221526 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5221527 leggere un libro per il buon lettore significa conoscere la personalit e la mentalit di uno sconosciuto cercare di comprenderlo possibilmente riuscire a diventargli amico

5221530 i was running late rushing from my last job to the birds nest for the mens 100m final as i turned the corner with one of my colleagues we saw a full moon rising above the stadium and we could not believe our luck
5221531 i had to decide if it would be worth stopping to shoot this picture and risk losing my spot in the stadium i decided i could shoot this image quickly
5221532 luckily i had a long lens with me as it would have been difficult to capture the image without it i waited a few minutes for the moon to move in line with the torch and this was the result

5221543 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
5221544 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment

5221683 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the united states from attacking its nuclear sites
5221684 it is clear that for years iran has had shihab 3 ballistic missiles which put israel within its reach but the threat posed by iran comes from its nuclear programme and not from its satellites or ballistic missiles
5221685 we were basically stuck up the canyon without or rafts

5221690 i think everyone was disappointed with thursday so we had a few scores to settle at rushden

5221705 when i got the opportunity against sydney i just wanted to go out there and contribute to the team
5221706 i felt i did that and i really wanted to back it up yesterday and i thought i did that too
5221707 at the end of the day we get on really well and we keep pushing each other hard on the training track and whoever gets the nod from the selectors is out of our control

5221765 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5221766 we obviously are going to have to reevaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5221767 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5221768 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it

5221788 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5221789 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

5221797 along with other prisoners he worked in the fields day after day in rain and sun during summer and winter his life appeared to be nothing more than backbreaking labor and slow starvation the intense suffering reduced him to a state of despair article continues below on one particular day the hopelessness of his situation became too much for him he saw no reason to continue his struggle no reason to keep on living his life made no difference in the world so he gave up leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners as he waited head down he felt a presence slowly he looked up and saw a skinny old prisoner squat down beside him the man said nothing instead he used a stick to trace in the dirt the sign of the cross the man then got back up and returned to his work as solzhenitsyn stared at the cross drawn in the dirt his entire perspective changed he knew he was only one man against the all powerful soviet empire yet he knew there was something greater than the evil he saw in the prison camp something greater than the soviet union he knew that hope for all people was represented by that simple cross through the power of the cross anything was possible solzhenitsyn slowly rose to his feet picked up his shovel and went back to work outwardly nothing had changed inside he had received hope

5222049 lastimosamente es lo que no existe hoy porque lo que tenemos es la lista tasc n una pol tica de exclusiones y eso no puede ni debe ser en el servicio publico
5222050 estimo lo que est n haciendo melo urquiola stalin bello porque todos han luchado contra la injusticias todos han llevado adelante su trabajo pero ahora debemos determinar quien de nosotros puede convocar de mejor manera la unidad que no es solo los militantes de los partidos la unidad es el mundo independiente es incluso ese chavismo frustrado decepcionado que no encuentra donde domiciliarse porque no se siente representado
5222051 para enfrentarlo hay que trabajar fundamentalmente 3 reas de trabajo ninguna ciudad puede vivir sin unidades de producci n santa cruz de mora tiene cafetales la gente en puerto cabello y guanta tiene un puerto mientras que caracas se ha quedado sin industrias todo se ha extinguido se cre a que quit ndole los incentivos a la industria iban a dejar de venir oleadas de campesinos a las ciudades y en consecuencia se iba a disminuir la marginalidad y eso ha sido un error

5222053 we are fed up with india and we are fed up with pakistan
5222054 when i am in india i am treated as a kashmiri and not as an indian
5222055 if i am told that i am kashmiri then i am kashmiri
5222056 there is no government nothing only people on the roads thats all
5222057 it was just all so fine from the indian point of view you had the kashmiri separatists almost isolated
5222058 everything was moving so beautifully and then these guys start playing electoral politics it was one of the best times after the militancy but now it has gone back to the 90s phase
5222059 i think the chief minister was hoping the issue would get him some votes in the jammu region and they didnt bargain on the kind of response that they got
5222060 now on both sides in jammu and kashmir it has gotten far beyond the land issue
5222061 if you are economically strong you can fight for your independence if you are weak then you have nothing

5222072 la deuda que tenemos con la ciudad de caracas es demasiado grande y ante el deterioro de la misma se decidi proponer la candidatura de claudio ferm n la cual tiene la suficiente fuerza social en la clase media y en las clases populares para ponerle un alto a jorge rodr guez que es el verdadero adversario a vencer situaci n que algunos candidatos parecen olvidar
5222073 lo que estamos tratando en caracas es un asunto serio en donde tendremos un mill n setecientos mil electores y contendientes abusadores que inescrupulosamente pretender n hacer uso del erario p blico

5222087 of course the fires are causing panic in the local population
5222088 there are a lot of questions to ask the president
5222089 this letter is a disgusting attempt to justify the deliberate killings of innocent civilians there is no justification for these killings by the taliban
5222090 canada is in afghanistan at the request of the democratically elected government of that country canadians are part of a un sanctioned nato led coalition that is attempting to bring stability and security to the people of afghanistan we will continue to fight for these goals we will continue to protect the afghan people from these ruthless killers
5222091 of course its a very chilling situation and a rather dramatic example of the deteriorating security situation there can be no justification ever for killing innocent aid workers
5222092 did i really say prince edward are you sure anyway of course it wasnt him im not some kind of freak
5222093 but i do remember him being there on many of those occasions when i was smuggled in for tea and shagging
5222094 he was always asking about the west end and whether i knew anyone behind the scenes at we will rock you he had his own freddie mercury costume
5222095 the rest of them were like a completely normal german family

5222118 but now that everyone has aired their feelings today we can get back to work
5222119 whats important now is that they know were not willing to vote for taxes
5222120 i believe the cuts go too far in some instances and im unhappy to see the reinstatement of the higher corporate tax rate and other taxes but no one has put together a plan to balance the budget without significant new revenues
5222121 runs the risk of putting california on the brink of bankruptcy along with many of its citizens and businesses
5222122 we have a 15 billion deficit thanks to the irresponsible budget choices by democrats in this legislature spending on new programs and bigger government
5222123 we are ready with a compassionate balanced budget that meets the governors demands and will keep our economy strong maintain our commitment to education and protect the states most vulnerable citizens
5222124 we need a spending limit to force the state to save money
5222125 if the cuts weve proposed arent deep enough what cuts would you make
5222126 its time to get real its time to get practical its time to get it done
5222127 i want to come up here and be a responsible adult lets just fix this

5222132 the outlook is not good but we are giving the calf its only option it cant be fed and in fact we wouldnt know what to feed it
5222133 im very happy to be number one but the feeling doesnt change too much because the last years i did very well too
5222134 i was very happy being the number two so finally im number one for sure theres satisfaction but at the same time i dont know i dont have time to celebrate i play new york in one week
5222135 tropical storm fay poses some risks to the oil and gas production in the gulf
5222136 we must maintain thorough preparations as there is always the possibility of a limited conflict with north korea
5222137 steadily attempt to promote an ideological rift in south korea we should be fully prepared for that
5222138 are aimed to ignite a new war on the korean peninsula and stifle the dprk north korea by force of arms
5222139 the gangster like intention to blackmail the dprk militarily and destroy it by force of arms will only spark off confrontation and conflict
5222140 i think during my lifetime i will see the reunification of the two koreas
5222141 it can happen any day and it can happen suddenly we must be very much prepared for that
5222142 more than anyone else i have deep deep affection for the people in north korea they are our brothers and sisters i dont want to engage in any political showmanship i want actual and genuine dialogue towards mutual benefit and co existence on the peninsula
5222143 we might have to bring a few young players back in this week because if you do lose or you are not playing well at least youre gaining something from it
5222144 theres not a lot to be gained from losing with the same sort of team
5222145 at least this year weve introduced a lot of new players
5222146 its all relative if we dont make the eight and we blood some young kids thats a positive
5222147 if you make the eight and you havent blooded any kids and you finish in the first week of the finals whats better
5222148 i think every team sets out to make the eight at the start of the year and we are still in the mix so thats a real important factor at this time of the year
5222149 i would certainly rather be playing in games that definitely have a degree of pressure and then the young guys who are playing them are learning something
5222150 the cupboard is a little bit bare in terms of weve got a lot of rookies but they cant all play
5222151 with that sort of injury he was told not to fly so hell be assessed by our doctors when he gets back
5222152 weve put a full stop today on the sonny bill williams file weve placed this chapter into the clubs history and archives
5222153 as far as im concerned the book on sonny bill williams is now closed
5222154 the clubs received a significant payout one of the biggest in the history of australian sport
5222155 im happy that weve got a full stop on it theres no winners in this saga
5222156 the bulldogs have lost a player theyve developed since the age of 16 one of the best players to come through our club the game has lost one of its significant profiles and for sonny bill himself hes made some decisions that hell have to live with for the rest of his life
5222157 theres no fairytale ending at the end of this theres no one running around the bulldogs club yelling and screaming with delight this is actually a relatively sad day
5222158 i was willing to go a lot more its all good 750 we can stop there
5222159 thats not our plan wed like to be able to spend that sort of money
5222160 theres no ready made fix to actually spend that money at the moment
5222161 simply cant undo in one budget what has taken 12 years to develop

5222185 we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid related to disclosure is the idea of how we make sure not to set expectations around the release that end up disappointing you features that dont make it claims that dont stick or support we dont provide

5222193 as early as 1 a m today monday maasim saranggani was attacked by armed elements of milf followed by ambuscades in lanao norte municipalities
5222194 the pnp armed forces are doing our best to secure other areas in lanao as well as other provinces affected by these movements by milf personnel
5222195 they left the area that is the report from our ground troops
5222196 they cant stay there too long they also felt the pressure from the military
5222197 as of now wala na as of now theres no more
5222198 but clearing operations are still ongoing in kolambugan because we have received reports that some rebels have disguised themselves as civilians
5222199 the milf leadership ordered them to pullout get out of the area
5222200 for me federer is still technically the best he is the best player in the history of tennis
5222201 if federer can improve i can too for sure i can improve the serve 100 percent i can improve my volley im happy but its important to be humble if you want to continue improving
5222202 nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year
5222203 the feeling for sure is very happy for being no 1 but the feeling doesnt change too much because the last years i did very well too it is a satisfaction i want to enjoy these two days probably but later i have to be focused on new york for the us open
5222204 theres no different pressure now im number one it doesnt change ill probably be number two in a few months you never know
5222205 can he get the title for liverpool as ronaldo did last season why not
5222206 of course they are different players ronaldo comes in from the side but fernando is a real striker he has everything to be the best player this season
5222207 there was nothing on when he got the ball but he scores a few goals like that he is always looking for the target and as soon as he gets space to shoot he shoots and often scores
5222208 fernando played wonderfully at the euros and always when you need him he scores very important goals
5222209 he is a top quality player and for me he is the best striker in the world if you are speaking about a real striker he is the pinnacle he is everything not only in normal games but more often than not in special games
5222210 any horses who have breathing problems lose at least seven pounds of ability but he gave us a great day in the st leger and now hes won a listed race and two group threes this season
5222211 a lot of things havent gone right for him but he has hardly put a foot wrong his defeat at royal ascot came because my stable was out of sorts at the time
5222212 hes a brave tough horse he got quite far back but when johnny asked for an effort he pulled it out
5222213 last season he won impressively first time at carlisle and i feel that took the edge off him for newbury so hell not have a prep this time
5222214 with a chaser rated as high as him youd expect to to be close to top weight in a hennessy but with denman in the line up hell be around 3lb out of the handicap
5222215 i knew i had to play my butt off just to make it up there for the barclays i didnt want four weeks off and im glad i at least got into the first one im ecstatic
5222216 ashley has been fantastic for us im pleased gabby and john have signed new contracts and weve got a couple more players that we are looking to do exactly the same with with ashley young being one of them
5222217 we are in conversation about that i dont think the chairman randy lerner has any major problem about sorting out wages for people if they are doing the business week in and week out on the pitch
5222218 agbonlahor has done that in my two seasons here carew has been terrific since being swapped with milan baros at lyon and young has been absolute class
5222219 it means he will get a new contract ashley hasnt come and asked for anything
5222220 he has got a number of years left to run on his contract but id like to sort him out and i am sure he is enjoying his football here which is great
5222221 if he continues to play in the fashion he is for us who knows what might happen to him in the future but we would be delighted to keep him a bit longer
5222222 as far as england is concerned his agbonlahors time will come today was a great start for him
5222223 i was a bit surprised that ashley young wasnt in the squad but his time will come as well ive no doubts whatsoever that will happen
5222224 wie argumenten heeft praat ze uit en hangt niet bij nacht en ontij vlaggen waar dat niet hoort
5222225 his exquisitely clear articulation of what dramatherapy is how it really functions as therapy and its value in todays world especially with the inclusion of many exciting cross cultural vignettes make this expanded 2nd edition by phil jones unquestionably one of the best textbooks in our field

5222350 china already has 171 diplomatic allies while taiwan has only 23
5222351 china will not sign a formal pact on diplomatic truce but it might reach a tacit agreement and allow taiwan to keep the 23 allies these mostly small nations are unimportant to china and by not launching ties with them china can save lots of money
5222352 now that taiwan stops throwing money these allies are angry inside but cannot show it

5222382 for the first time we present an experimental set up that allows measuring the subtle forces both physical and chemical that arise when single hairs slide past each other or are pressed against each other
5222383 the findings will help provide clearer strategies for optimising hair care products

5222402 many of the people who seek therapy are not mentally ill they dont meet criteria for depression or other illnesses
5222403 so if you focus primarily on what is wrong with them there may not be much progress
5222404 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
5222405 were finding that people can learn to be more hopeful and that will help them in many ways
5222406 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well

5222413 er gilt als parteisoldat und workaholic und dem vernehmen nach hat es ihn in den vergangenen monaten fast zerrissen auf den kurs seiner spd nicht einwirken zu k nnen ob es ihn nun noch einmal in die erste reihe dr ngt bleibt abzuwarten ohne zweifel k nnte er der spd helfen doch an die m r von der m nte fee vom magier aus dem sauerland der alle probleme einfach wegzaubert sollte niemand glauben
5222414 ein altvorsitzender entwickelt neuen ehrgeiz und es gibt bisher keinen in der spd der sich ffentlich dar ber mokiert h tte das ist schon eine ganze menge f r eine partei die nichts ausdauernder tut als die eignung ihrer vorsitzenden infrage zu stellen franz m ntefering darf es als respektsbeweis annehmen er wird aber so klug sein es nicht misszuverstehen etwa als aufforderung den gegenw rtigen parteichef zu ersetzen dennoch die spd darf sich ber den r ckkehrer freuen er k nnte zur st tze werden falls sich die chronisch deprimierten genossen doch noch einmal aufrichten m chten
5222415 franz m ntefering zeichnet vieles aus was anderen fehlt so ist es durchaus verst ndlich dass der mann jetzt wieder ins gespr ch gebracht wird aber es ist ein irrtum zu glauben das dilemma der deutschen sozialdemokraten l se sich damit dass der 68 j hrige wieder im vordergrund steht m ntefering der vorvorletzte parteivorsitzende und vorletzte spd vizekanzler ist teil des problems der partei und alles andere als eine einfache l sung der sauerl nder hat zusammen mit gerhard schr der jene radikale kurskorrektur in der sozial und arbeitspolitik bewerkstelligt die die spd zwar vor bergehend regierungsf hig hielt sie jetzt aber mit dem fast folgerichtigen erstarken der linken vor schier unl sbare schwierigkeiten stellt
5222416 franz der kanns wirklich es sagt viel ber den j mmerlichen zustand der spd wenn allein die ank ndigung von franz m ntefering sein bundestags mandat wieder auszuf llen bei seinen parteifreunden zu hoffnungen f hrt jetzt k me der wunderheiler ob all jene die dem tapferen mann jetzt wieder hohe weihen andienen wohl wissen welch erb rmliches zeugnis sie sich selbst damit ausstellen
5222417 franz m ntefering der kantige sauerl nder hat zwei vorteile gegen ber kurt beck er kennt sich zum einen in berlin aus beherrscht das spiel mit der hauptstadt presse beherrscht alle tricks aus dem parteien apparat zum anderen ist er glaubw rdig steht f r seine ideale ein guter berater ist er damit allemal aber der heilsbringer den viele jetzt in ihm sehen ist er nicht
5222418 wenn m ntefering wieder mitmischt dann werden sich viele an ihm ausrichten jedes wort wird z hlen im zweifel gegen beck verwandt werden und seine autorit t zermahlen sollte die spd im zuge der hessischen ereignisse noch tiefer rutschen ein desaster drohen ist auch eine r ckkehr m nteferings an die parteispitze nicht ausgeschlossen bevor das spd schiff in schwerer see zerschellt wird ein kapit n gebraucht der sauerl nder ist ein kapit n
5222419 der kann auch retten w rde der sauerl nder wohl knochentrocken von sich selbst sagen in welcher funktion der ex vizekanzler und fr here arbeitsminister t tig sein k nnte interessiert nicht er ist ein mann mit kultstatus in der spd er hat den ber hmten stallgeruch er spricht die sprache der kleinen leute er ist gewieft und er hat autorit t eine lichtgestalt ist m nte nicht die parteilinke hat ihm das leben schwer gemacht allen voran andrea nahles alles vergessen was z hlt ist der typ m ntefering hinter ihm kann sich die partei versammeln er w re zwar der mann von gestern aber das ist kein makel denn die spd war immer eine partei die ihre vergangenheit f r die zukunft h lt
5222420 es steht niemandem zu die r ckkehr von franz m ntefering moralisch zu bewerten der sauerl nder ganz allein entscheidet wie er mit dem tod seiner frau ankepetra umgeht
5222421 ohne zweifel k nnte m ntefering der spd helfen doch an die m r vom magier aus dem sauerland der alle probleme einfach wegzaubert sollte niemand glauben selbst als bergangsvorsitzender als der er f r eine m gliche zeit nach kurt beck immer wieder gehandelt wurde k nnte m ntefering den fl gelstreit kaum beenden dass seine autorit t begrenzt ist musste er 2005 als parteichef lernen in einer personalfrage verweigerte die spd linke ihm die gefolgschaft trieb ihn zum r cktritt auch heute sind die parteilinken l ngst keine m nte fans nur durch sein comeback w ren die grundsatzfragen nicht gekl rt allen voran wie h lt man es mit der linkspartei ein m ntefering an vorderster front in welcher funktion auch immer w re eine hilfe im wahlkampf viel mehr sollte man nicht von ihm erwarten

5222423 eine marke hat gro e wirtschaftliche bedeutung f r ein unternehmen sie steht f r vertrauen in ein produkt zumal wenn es sich wie bei eucerin um eine marke handelt die in der apotheke verkauft wird

5222437 it was a matter of pulling data we have available on the back end around how often they visit the communities and how much they do when they are there

5222443 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
5222444 to the mall the playground play dates to target just to go somewhere
5222445 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere
5222446 we just dont have as much money as we used to
5222447 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
5222448 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that any more i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
5222449 always wanted to be a stay at home mom id rather do the job myself
5222450 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
5222451 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
5222452 we are not staying home with our children by default
5222453 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
5222454 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
5222455 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
5222456 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
5222457 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out

5222461 how can we justify eating out when we could go to a store and buy enough for a couple days worth of meals

5222473 i felt the players were brimming with confidence but we never got going
5222474 theres no excuse im not saying it was missed chances or refereeing decisions that wasnt acceptable
5222475 you certainly cant go pointing fingers at any particular individuals or even groups of the make up of the team it was one through to eleven
5222476 ive got to be thinking that was a freak result things have been excellent in the last two or three weeks but we just dropped off the pace today
5222477 sometimes you just hold your hands up and say youve been out fought or they did something tactically that we couldnt cope with or they were technically better
5222478 we were really looking for blogs that know their state well
5222479 it helps us have a larger audience and a very specific audience in a lot of cases
5222480 i was on a conference call earlier with a bunch of the other bloggers that are coming
5222481 many of them expressed that they dont know what they will be doing i dont know what im going to do and were just going to see what happens and try to find out and cover whats going on
5222482 in terms of how news is reported and how much its dominated by television coverage the political convention does seem like a show
5222483 i think theres going to be so many other meetings happening networking happening things that arent even happening in the pepsi center
5222484 i feel just fine with writing with a biased or partisan point of view
5222485 if you look at what i write about and how i write about it i think i have a very good track record of telling it the way it is
5222486 i highly disagree with the term cheerleader there have been plenty of times when i have called out democrats for decisions ive disagreed with
5222487 in 2004 we only had 12 so were excited to welcome more than 200 this year

5222493 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the united states from attacking its nuclear sites
5222494 it is clear that for years iran has had shihab 3 ballistic missiles which put israel within its reach but the threat posed by iran comes from its nuclear programme and not from its satellites or ballistic missiles

5222504 we were telegraphed what the nazis were doing and nobody heeded those warnings
5222505 mergers and acquisitions are going to continue and theres nothing that can stop it
5222506 i think the industry is going through a paradigm change and its not just north american companies its all companies the economy worldwide is kind of in crisis demographics are changing and birth rates are declining so is it easy out there not it isnt is it getting harder yes it is but if a lot of groups are not going to survive the paradigm shift hopefully well be one of those that do
5222507 i think if you draw parallels with the movie industry youll see a lot of mergers and acquisitions that took place as it was forming in the 20s and 30s which resulted in the six major studios that are still around today
5222508 fail to enhance the character and quality of the area or promote local distinctiveness
5222509 if were not able to get that maybe the new school has got to be redesigned
5222510 if they protest hard in one area we hope to get a relaxation somewhere else if not the redevelopment would be really in difficulty
5222511 the planners have given the proper reason for refusal that what has been proposed is nowhere near sufficient quality to replace the grandeur of the luker building
5222512 its very frightening and im particularly scared at night im suffering from sleep deprivation because i am repeatedly woken by panic and bad news
5222513 on monday i awoke at 4 30am to huge bangs in the city centre and the sound of attacks on the munitions factory near tbilisi
5222514 many foreigners have left the city in reaction to the recent events of the night and i cant blame them for that
5222515 im not comfortable with my decision to leave but my instincts kicked in and my friends and i caught a taxi
5222516 i joined my friends because i knew they were well connected enough to get me to safety and provide a safe place in armenia
5222517 i want to go back because i feel solidarity with the georgian people this is my home my job and my friends are here
5222518 i am hoping for peace for the fighting and killing to stop so that we can begin to help those people who have been caught up in this
5222519 it is not their fault and they will need help on both sides of the front line
5222520 there will be so much rebuilding of this country to do too such as winning back confidence from people abroad and repairing infrastructure the economy and inter ethnic relations
5222521 i hope things settle i have to get in and do humanitarian work and try to recover some of the damage that has been done over the past few days

5222528 he is a player whose club did not want to sell him
5222529 there are a lot of clubs who want our players and we dont want to sell them either this is football it was a matter between the player and his club
5222530 he said that he would like to play for us but his club did not want to sell him
5222531 no the feeling is that is this is going to be a good year for real madrid
5222532 we said that the project was complete and i am sure that this season is going to be one of consolidation

5222574 4o millionen euro waren das bereits im jahr 2004 seither ist der f rderbetrag f r die atomlobby verdreifacht worden das steht in krassem gegensatz zum wunsch der sterreicherinnen 71 der sterreicherinnen wollen diese zahlungen einstellen und etwa zwei drittel wollen einen sofortigen ausstieg aus dem euratom vertrag

5222582 that morning as soon as we grabbed those cats out of their pads and played
5222583 five senior students had harassed a junior in his room making him strip and forcing him to do sit ups on the table
5222584 the fight had nothing to do with us harassing the junior student
5222585 the same senior students were also involved in breaking college rules on various occasions while in sherubtse
5222586 the junior student had been mentally depressed and were regularly giving him moral support so that his career is not affected
5222587 such punishment will set a strong disciplinary culture in the college which has just opened
5222588 jumja and taktikoti where major accidents took place in recent times are fragile by nature and if we stop the work in monsoon and continue in next season a project that would take only five years might take about ten years to complete
5222589 with boulders ready to fall loose on one hand and a deadline to be met on the other the labourers have no time to rest
5222590 there was no apple on some of the trees last year and financially it was devastating because apples are our main source of income

5222595 let me repeat liu xiang will not withdraw unless the pain is unbearable
5222596 after liu xiangs injury i wont bother coming back to the birds nest for more
5222597 when you see the crowd you realize why he had to come out
5222598 his takeoff foot so there is a lot of stress on that area
5222599 in watching warmups we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5222600 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5222601 and will encourage him to come back to the track
5222602 but they will understand when somebody has an accident you cant help it
5222603 the track is perfect anything is possible in the final
5222604 chicago when it came down to kyle and jimmie and jimmie lost it on the restart i didnt want to have to go through that pain so i just did everything i could to have the best restart i could and it worked out great
5222605 i cant believe my good fortune ive been in the presence of really fast company
5222606 except for kyle busch finishing up there we had a chance to have two or three winners actually four winners out of the top five
5222607 kyle is just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us due to bonus points
5222608 so thats what we just have to keep doing is go out here and try to win the next three events and go into the chase on even ground
5222609 he is always strong hes been the guy that weve got to race on these mile and a half and two mile race tracks
5222610 hes been decent at other race tracks too but not as stout as he is at these and there are a lot of these in the chase
5222611 he took a giant gamble on me i felt at the time to put me in that car
5222612 jack won the race that day i believe greg biffle won it and we finished 10th and all five cars were in the top 10
5222613 to be a part of that again today for ford motor co for roush and for all the guys its an honor
5222614 q where do you see russia fitting into this as it comes onto the scene
5222615 the most shocking thing is not that there are corporate raiders in russia who attempt to steal your shares
5222616 the shocking thing is that the police worked hand in hand with them and actually performed the theft of the documents so that the corporate raiders could then do their work
5222617 from the entire team at net1 we congratulate the iraqi consortium on this historic achievement and look forward to the successful implementation of the various projects already identified for implementation as well as the projects currently in business development net1 is proud that the development of its core technology from which it creates end user products that satisfy the requirements of its customers can change the way business is conducted leading to the improvement of peoples lives we share the belief of our iraqi partners that our technology can play a fundamental role in the upliftment of the economy the success of any technology should be measured not only by the profits it generates for its inventors suppliers and users but also by the difference that it makes to the lives of people
5222618 if you are a saas vendors and you are not supporting saml you wont be in business very long
5222619 after consultations with legal advisers and close political supporters and on their advice im taking the decision of resigning
5222620 my resignation will go to the speaker of the national assembly today
5222621 let me repeat liu xiang will not withdraw unless the pain is unbearable
5222622 after liu xiangs injury i wont bother coming back to the birds nest for more
5222623 when you see the crowd you realize why he had to come out
5222624 his takeoff foot so there is a lot of stress on that area
5222625 in watching warmups we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5222626 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5222627 and will encourage him to come back to the track
5222628 but they will understand when somebody has an accident you cant help it
5222629 the track is perfect anything is possible in the final
5222630 we look forward to put in place new authorities to improve confidence and stability in markets and to provide better oversight for fannie mae and freddie mac
5222631 the federal housing administration will begin to implement new policies intended to keep more deserving american families in their homes
5222632 nous exigeons le retrait sans d lai des forces doccupation russes ensuite commen ons r fl chir n gocier sur la mani re d viter un divorce d finitif entre nos deux pays
5222633 la g orgie ne se rendra jamais ne tol rera jamais la perte de la plus petite parcelle de son territoire

5222636 nous attendons plus de soutien des autres pays car il ne sagit pas dune guerre entre la russie et la g orgie cest une guerre entre la civilisation et la barbarie
5222637 weve faced them so many different times with different partners and theyre two of the best in the world
5222638 misty and i played steady our coach told us outlast them theyre a new team you will get them stay patient my hats off to them for making it this far
5222639 it could be too much for anyone but not for us
5222640 we were confident we could make it we knew we didnt have time to know each other and practice
5222641 im a dreamer shes a dreamer larissa wrote me something the other day and put it on the wall in our room everything is possible for us we have been believing in this the last 10 days
5222642 we had kicked each other under the net on that first point the next one she threw me on my butt so thats what i get for celebrating in her face i guess but i really respect her feistiness
5222643 you need at least a month to get ready with a new partner
5222644 i respect what larissa and ana paula have done here we certainly know we have something special this is our eighth season together we know how lucky we are
5222645 i thought the photo finish was between sherone and i for third clearly i was watching from the wrong angle because she ended up in second thats really the only thing i was hanging around for i just wanted to see if i got a medal
5222646 i just think maybe its time for america to humble themselves
5222647 were getting a pretty good taste of what its like to be at the bottom and its going to make us hungry to get back to the top we have to go home work harder and next year at the world championships turn this around and for the next olympics turn this around
5222648 when she came up on me made that move i probably tightened up instead of trying to go with her
5222649 there was no call back so i went im disappointed
5222650 there was a lot of pushing there was a lot of body contact in there but i ran hard that last 100 i felt like i gave it all out but i think i let the guys leave me so it was hard to chase them down
5222651 in the final im not going to be running for a time ill be running for a gold medal
5222652 but i definitely feel like im in great shape i think im very close to seeing a 48 seconds
5222653 clearly its going to look like jamaicas going to take us but were going to get on the line were going to have a good chemistry great hand offs and we hope to get to the finish line first
5222654 im not sure i can wait another eight years to play in another olympics though it took me 12 years to get here
5222655 i sat on the beach and asked myself why there wasnt one shoe that matches every outfit
5222656 we intend to invest rs 5 billion by fy10 which will include the launch of several channels
5222657 your settings may very depending on source room conditions and personal preference
5222658 please see a qualified calibration technician for legitimate modifications to your system
5222659 it was strange i couldnt plan anything in my life i just had to wait
5222660 we cant take any more people than is our capacity
5222661 the only answer is to come up with a common solution to bosnias problems why should we spend the money to build a new expensive system when we already have a working one just across the dividing line
5222662 it is dangerous but we cant do anything about it said ferid niksic the assistant to the warden
5222663 but its not as though if you just put away the 200 people the situation on the streets would be ideal without crime
5222664 they ordered me to pay 1 000 bosnian marka 500 euros but i couldnt afford to pay
5222665 i wouldnt want to escape because i was not guilty
5222666 i waited five or six months to start my sentence but that was good because i had time to finish up some work before coming in
5222667 there are conflicts but they happen on an individual basis rather than because of national identity
5222668 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5222669 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5222670 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5222671 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5222672 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products
5222673 one of the most exciting things about the new music business is that artists have a wealth of options
5222674 chris iwelumo is the striker ive been seeking for the past two seasons
5222675 he has been a revelation about the place and had to play after his goals in midweek
5222676 we play with two wingers who are a threat to anybody on our own pitch and i am delighted everything has settled down so quickly
5222677 we never took our chances but conceded soft goals and if it means a change of personnel until we get it right then thats what well do
5222678 ultimately ill take responsibility as i picked the team but i wouldnt have envisaged conceding goals like that
5222679 goals change games theres no doubt about that we were in control of the game and had three or four chances but we shot ourselves in the foot
5222680 he is a player with experience of winning promotions from this division and played in the premier league last season
5222681 i explained to him why i needed money for signing other players
5222682 he can understand if you have javier mascherano lucas steven gerrard and then plessis you have four other midfielders and maybe you can sell one player
5222683 when i was first talking with xabi about a transfer we needed money after these months it is not a question of money we would have to have a massive offer because alonso is a great player
5222684 but if we sell one or two players we have enough money to bring in one more good player
5222685 dont forget we will need eight british players and the left footer we were talking about can play in three positions too
5222686 xabi has had a dead leg so we had to protect him
5222687 at the end of the game plessis was injured too so we had to change we knew xabi was only maybe 80 of his ability so it was to protect him
5222688 xabi is our player and he is playing well if he continues to play well i will be really pleased but it doesnt matter if you have one good player and you need another one you have to keep the balance of the team
5222689 my son is an accomplished lawyer who earns a fortune
5222690 on his friends last birthday he gave him a car
5222691 my son is more accomplished he is a pilot who rakes in millions
5222692 why he was so rich he bought a private jet for his friend on his birthday
5222693 but my son is better he designs houses for a well known architectural company and earns more than either of your sons he could even afford to buy his friend a house in the swiss alps
5222694 is momenteel nog niet beschikbaar maar zal beschikbaar zijn of is momenteel nog niet beschikbaar
5222695 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
5222696 it is amazing to me that rather than going to csiro the national academy of sciences in the us the australian academy of sciences or other scientific organisations from around the world that are all consistently providing the same evidence a significant proportion of the federal shadow cabinet and many others in the liberal party and national party and other interest groups are collecting information not from reputable sources but from websites which may or may not be funded by a right wing lobby group or a fossil fuel company which says there is a conspiracy
5222697 il libro contiene naturalmente molto materiale su pete e sulla relazione con kate moss il suo punto di vista riguardo gli show a cui non si presentato il suo parere sulle droghe sugli arresti sulle persecuzioni e sulle relazioni con gli altro membri della band ma la cosa interessante che non si tratta solo di un libro su pete c molto materiale che spiega la prospettiva di tutta la band su tanti argomenti un libro che ti offre anche un punto di vista interno al gruppo e ti fa capire come pu essere vivere i nostri momenti di euforia cos come quelli di depressione e scontentezza
5222698 we have seen him practicing since his childhood we are confident that he will definitely get a gold medal
5222699 yesterday water flooded our village many people are trapped inside no help has come so far despite us informing the authorities we had asked for a boat which is not been provided yet

5222701 led by china and india economic growth in these economies has been strong with solid support from growth in domestic demand and strong trading activity with other emerging market economies
5222702 this appears to have ended the past decades unsustainable consumer debt driven economic growth particularly in the us
5222703 liquidity is likely to remain low and risk premia high for some time into the future
5222704 however emerging market economies should remain relatively strong on the back of continued domestic infrastructure investment and regional trade
5222705 we have achieved another year of record earnings driven by excellent operating performance cost control and the delivery of high margin growth projects into strong market conditions
5222706 im still a mother im just the mother of a dead child now

5222710 so i just wanted him to know that im actually taking guitar lessons from jay z right now and hes already taught me both chords to wonderwall
5222711 in fact its so much fun having jay teach me all of noels songs on the guitar hooray that im thinking of doing an oasis jay z remix album like danger mouses grey album

5222738 three dark silhouettes were observed at 12 25 pm on september 27 2003 on the southeast ridge of gurja himal
5222739 they looked almost human and walked upright on two legs
5222740 the yeti is not a bear or a monkey it is definitely an unknown creature that walks on two legs
5222741 i came here just to win and i did just that i didnt even know id broken the world record until i did my victory lap
5222742 now im just concentrating on my two races coming up i came here prepared and im going to try and do it the 100 and 200m double
5222743 i dont care about the rumours hes been tested over and over again
5222744 he is the best ever sprinter and ive said that before
5222745 he has run 9 69 and got the gold so he is definitely the greatest it was a spectacular performance and he was definitely the best here he could have run faster if he had run straight through the line
5222746 i was feeling good but i didnt feel it in my legs they died on me
5222747 it feels good to be here to be part of history
5222748 it was good to finish behind him bolt because theres no way anyone on earth could have beaten him tonight
5222749 to finish second to him that is a great accomplishment in itself usain is a great athlete it was jsut a matter of time before he proved himself on this stage
5222750 i cant be more satisfied with third place he bolt broke the world record you cant ask for more
5222751 everyone could see what he did he didnt even push through the line its an amazing time

5222755 upward pressure on inflation is likely to continue throughout the year largely due to rising food prices and elevated oil prices the indian government recently raised retail fuel prices by around 10 per cent and we expect there is more to come
5222756 we believe wpi inflation will remain in double digit territory until may 2009 we expect wpi inflation of 17 per cent by september 2008
5222757 but with real rates still very low further action is needed in order to curb price pressures
5222758 after several years of strong growth of close to 9 per cent this year the rate would moderate to around 8 per cent level and stay near there in 2009
5222759 nous nattendons plus de hausse des taux de la bce les donn es sur les prix et sur lactivit vont dans la m me direction linflation paraissant avoir atteint son pic et lactivit saffaiblissant plus rapidement que pr vu

5222767 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity

5222770 it seems that labours unpopular plans for a national road pricing scheme are alive and well
5222771 they are determined to press ahead with their untried and untested spy in the sky national project even though it looks like an it disaster waiting to happen
5222772 we have been absolutely clear that any proposal for national road pricing would need to address the legitimate concerns people have
5222773 were a very long way from that which is why our priority now and over the next decade is on tackling congestion where it is experienced most in our cities and on our motorways

5222813 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5222814 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5222815 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5222816 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5222817 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5222818 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5222819 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5222836 when i arrived it was sitting perched on top of the pole doing a balancing act
5222837 but it seemed quite happy it was just looking around and surveying its kingdom
5222838 there was no way we could get it down so we called the fire service the cat was uninjured we assume it headed straight home
5222839 i am really enjoying my season so far weve had a couple of ups and downs but im getting to grips with the car and understanding more about its unique characteristics every day

5222852 we will be patient with them and not do anything that will turn into a law and order situation there will be several rounds of talks both at the state and at the tripartite level in delhi and matters will be resolved through them
5222853 we will be patient as long as it is required
5222854 this is a very positive development and i appeal to all to keep darjeeling tension free during the winter vacations as well when there is a huge rush of tourists to destinations in the hills

5222861 and again general david petraeus said summarily and arbitrarily taking our troops out of there as senator obama has proposed is not in the best interests of the united states could potentially be destabilizing and put at risk all of the great work and valor and sacrifice and blood and treasure our country has put into that country
5222862 this is a march for freedom and god willing indian occupation will end soon
5222863 it was strange i couldnt plan anything in my life i just had to wait
5222864 we cant take any more people than is our capacity
5222865 the only answer is to come up with a common solution to bosnias problems why should we spend the money to build a new expensive system when we already have a working one just across the dividing line
5222866 it is dangerous but we cant do anything about it said ferid niksic the assistant to the warden
5222867 but its not as though if you just put away the 200 people the situation on the streets would be ideal without crime
5222868 they ordered me to pay 1 000 bosnian marka 500 euros but i couldnt afford to pay
5222869 i wouldnt want to escape because i was not guilty

5222873 i got on the 6 06am train and a message came through to say there had been a power failure ahead and the train would stop at rochdale we were told replacement buses would be put on but unfortunately rochdale station was closed and nobody could get out some people were crossing the tracks and shimmying down lampposts to get out
5222874 unfortunately this is something we are seeing more and more of
5222875 the fault has now been repaired by engineers but there have been knock on delays for some of the services
5222876 yesterday i could say that in europe there were differences in relation to russias actions in south ossetia some countries blamed georgia for the conflict others blamed russia for example the french and german settlement plan was strongly supported they pinned serious hopes on it
5222877 if somebody does not understand us it is not our problems
5222878 theoretically everything is possible but in practice a world war is unlikely some things have changed compared with the first and second world wars
5222879 first the great powers have developed many common long term interests

5222881 the first steps to relieving heel pain can be as simple as stretching your foot before getting out of bed in the morning icing your foot regularly and wearing proper footwear

5222892 i want to tell you why i let jack use my house
5222893 that night he wrote a seven page paper describing his goal of someday owning a horse ranch
5222894 he put a great deal of his heart into the project and the next day he handed it in to his teacher two day later he received his paper back on the front page was a large red f with a note that read see me after class
5222895 the boy with the dream went to see the teacher after class and asked why did i receive an f
5222896 the teacher said this is an unrealistic dream for a young boy like you
5222897 the boy went home and thought about it long and hard
5222898 finally after sitting with it for a week the boy turned in the same paper making no changes at all
5222899 i tell you this story because you are sitting in my 4 000 square foot house in the middle of my 200 acre horse ranch i still have that school paper framed over the fireplace
5222900 the best part of the story is that two summers ago that same schoolteacher brought 30 kids to camp out on my ranch for a week
5222901 jadi saya membayangkan kemajuan orang lain mengisyaratkan kemajuan saya sendiri sehingga saya dapat mengalahkan rasa iri tapi sebaliknya jika ternyata itu tidak terjadi maka saya akan marah dan iri hati

5222913 the bottom line is we cannot solve a 15 billion deficit without new revenue
5222914 this budget runs the risk of putting california on the brink of bankruptcy
5222915 it is time for democrats to take their heads out of the sand
5222916 what we get instead of real reform is phony reform pushed by our democratic friends

5222918 das problem ist dass es wegen der finanzkrise derzeit sehr wenige gibt die sich die postbank leisten k nnen

5222922 was die art und weise betrifft wie medienkonzerne mit urheberrechtlich gesch tzten inhalten auf youtube umgehen hat es sicherlich ein umdenken gegeben der eindruck dass all diese unternehmen bislang gegen die plattform waren ist aber falsch

5222947 some of those same neighbors who complained became my patients and some even got free medical care
5222948 they borrowed our computers when theirs were broken asked for rides in the snow when they couldnt get their cars out
5222949 our neighborhood would resemble a strip mall with its constant increase of activity throughout the day
5222950 ive been working in that neighborhood 15 years and very peacefully it makes no sense
5222951 there is an automotive repair shop two blocks away a coffee shop beauty salon and arts club right down the street
5222952 i felt the vet clinic wouldnt have a negative impact on the neighborhood
5222953 i dont want to make enemies id still be working there if my wife hadnt gotten ill but i have a right to sell my property for the use it was intended its been a business for 80 years these neighbors know it

5222970 un funcionario debe trabajar para su pueblo y no para beneficiarse a s mismo
5222971 the new salary and conditions for salaried doctors working in public hospitals would be a major attraction for interstate doctors
5222972 the government will soon start a new recruitment drive to lure doctors working interstate to the sa public hospital system
5222973 the new package will really help with recruitment and importantly will help us to keep the really hard working doctors currently in our public hospitals
5222974 it is laughable the drawn out industrial dispute will send a clear signal to health professionals interstate
5222975 while i welcome the resolution of the dispute it does nothing to actually bring new people here it sends the message that south australia is not a place to do business as a public health provider
5222976 ultimately help us greatly in recruitment and retention of doctors in the south australian system
5222977 congratulations to all those who have successfully completed the step up programme
5222978 this programme is integral to the departments strategy of encouraging more students to go on to higher education and reach their true potential
5222979 as a department we strive to ensure that people have the skills they need for the jobs they want
5222980 in doing so its our goal to achieve a dynamic innovative economy and one which meets the emerging challenges of today the success of step up to date goes a long way in helping us to achieve this objective
5222981 we are delighted once again to be able to showcase the outstanding achievements of the young people who have participated in the programme it is fitting that the director of higher education is here to share in their celebrations
5222982 the markets we operate in are becoming more international and the opportunities available through a business relationship with efg hermes are compelling

5222987 happiness is when what you think what you say and what you do are in harmony
5222988 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
5222989 no evil can happen to a good man either in life or after death
5222990 the isaf patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5222991 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time
5222992 as i write this russia is waging war on my country
5222993 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5222994 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5222995 as i write this russia is waging war on my country
5222996 its only natural to seek an arrest warrant as weve determined that a crime was committed
5222997 regardless of the differences of opinion it is unacceptable that those involved in whaling get injured or have their lives put in danger
5222998 een paar jaar geleden zou men de eigenschappen van de g810 voor onmogelijk hebben gehouden op een mobiele telefoon de features die de samsung g810 heeft waren slechts voorbehouden aan de duurste digitale cameras samsung is er in geslaagd om de g810 er tegelijkertijd robuust en elegant uit te laten zien

5223001 they have exposed a very limited set of capabilities that this architecture is capable of
5223002 next generation fibre channel storage systems market forecast 2007 2011
5223003 in addition to supporting multiple active controllers clustered systems virtualise the individual controllers and make the entire set of controllers appear as one single storage system to hosts
5223004 i believe the architecture has these features but ibm didnt feel comfortable presenting them to the market yet
5223005 weird nothing from ibm other than the announcement letters posted to ibm com world wide not even a press release no customer stories
5223006 maybe this whole xiv thing wasnt really all that big a deal after all
5223007 theyve taken a very conservative step in presenting this product to the market
5223008 on the contrary i think its because ibm is ibm and they like to do things in a conservative fashion
5223009 as a determined determinist i would say that yes you bet an experimenters choice what to measure was fixed from the dawn of time and so were the properties of the thing he decided to call a photon
5223010 if you believe in determinism you have to believe it all the way no escape possible conway and kochen have shown here in a beautiful way that a half hearted belief in pseudo determinism is impossible to sustain
5223011 head of security at meitanba mining group director liu w 3 others taking me now back to meitanba village scared my parents
5223012 ive been made to get into their car i want my parents to confirm what has happened today what time and place and w who the license plate number of the car i was taken away in im fine in their car it feels a bit like im being intercepted
5223013 weve had that happen they just stop working and die off
5223014 were trying to understand what is going on inside this brain material that could have direct implications for human health
5223015 clearly brain cells have evolved to reconnect under almost any circumstance that doesnt kill them
5223016 i think the bursting is a function of sensory deprivation
5223017 with no structured sensory input the hypothesis is that you get arbitrarily random and quite often detrimental activity because all these cells are asking for some kind of direction
5223018 it seems that sensory input is setting the background level of activity inside the brain
5223019 its like training an animal to do something by gradual increments
5223020 this system is a model everything it does is merely similar to what goes on in a brain its not really the same thing we can learn about the brain but it may mislead us
5223021 if this kind of work can make a 1 per cent difference to the life of an alzheimers patient it will be worth it
5223022 you can make these up to one week in advance
5223023 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5223024 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5223025 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5223026 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5223027 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5223028 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5223029 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5223030 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5223031 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
5223032 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
5223033 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
5223034 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5223035 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5223036 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5223037 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro

5223039 regardless of a difference of opinion it is unacceptable that those who are involved in whaling get injured or face life threatening dangers it is to my understanding that the international community will agree on our position

5223125 to tell the truth rugby today is all about the clubs
5223126 different coaches and clubs have their own cultures their own strategies and methods adaptation has more to do with moving from one club to another rather than from one country to another the capacity for adaptation is a key part of being a player these days for that you have to be willing to listen
5223127 im taking english lessons its an area where i want to progress rapidly to tell the truth i started classes before starting training with the wasps
5223128 as far as im concerned undertaking these classes is part of a professional rugby players job as a foreigner in a new team i really have to listen carefully to understand i have to do everything i can to make assimilating the instructions easier communication is fundamental
5223129 this has been a good experience for me generally speaking i mean i think back to when we had foreigners arriving at biarritz now its my turn to see what a difference it makes to have to integrate into a group its up to me to make the necessary effort its not up to the group to adapt to me
5223130 im not going to ask them to speak french that said my colleagues are helping me integrate and assimilate things
5223131 in pre season games we discover each other as partners they reveal the truth the way only the context of a match can
5223132 we learn about each other in training but its on the field that we get a different perspective on the group there are a lot of new players debuting this season its interesting we have laid a platform of work and weve got some common references a few markers
5223133 but its only in a match that we can test ourselves and well learn more
5223134 theyve played together for so daylong and run their system so well
5223135 its been circled on my calendar for about two years
5223136 they undergo well be reaching back to redeem ourselves everyones excited
5223137 changeover the movie goes on and nobody in the audience has any idea
5223138 we have target of rs 789 on gsk consumers the company is one of the largest players in the indian health foods industry it controls over 2 3rd of market in the hot malted beverages with a strong product portfolio including horlicks maltova boost and viva we expect the company to comfortably clock a 15 growth in topline over the next 2 3 years and a 17 growth in bottomline
5223139 this company has strong cash reserves and investments which is over rs 400 crore that equals to over rs 100 per share so that is the added cushion in this company so overall we expect the company to do pretty well over the next two three years and currently it is available at less than 2 5 times fy10 earnings i e cy09 for this company we think the stock can offer easy 20 25 upside from the current levels
5223140 knr construction was recently listed it is a small time player in the construction space but it is a diversified player in the construction space basically having presence in road transportation engineering irrigation and water management and urban infrastructure development increasing government focus on infrastructure augurs good for the company the 11th plan envisages investment in infrastructure of over rs 7 40 000 crore we believe considering the execution capabilities of knr over the last many years we think it would be one of the key beneficiaries of the same which is visible in the kind of orders that the company is getting the average ticket size of the order has increased from rs 35 crore couple of years back to about rs 65 crore now
5223141 we believe the company will continue do very well over the next three four years with an order book of rs 1 500 crore which is almost equal to three times fy08 sales and the company is also bidding for projects under the nhdp national highway development programme totaling to rs 25 000 crore consider its strike rate we see good visibility in the topline for the company over the next 3 4 years the stock is available at less than 4 times fy10 earnings and price to book of 0 6 so overall we think this is a value play in the construction space and we have a target of rs 88 on the stock
5223142 aptech has a good relative strength in comparison to nifty and other stocks it has seen a very good accumulation in last four months and it has come out on the higher side money is flowing in the stock one can buy near its current support between rs 210 220 or even one can go long at the current price with a stoploss of rs 190 i would put a target of more than rs 270 in coming days
5223143 strong volume growth of more than 20 in decorative paints boosted domestic revenue growth to 34 5 during 1qfy09 higher raw material costs especially turpentine oil and vegetable oil have depressed standalone ebidta margin by 130bp the company has effected a 22 price increase in solvent based paints since february 2008 average 7 3 and has increased prices across segments by 1 5 from august 2008 long term prospects look encouraging due to rising consumerism and infrastructure growth the stock trades at 24 7x fy09e of rs 50 7 and 20 2x fy10e earnings of rs 62 maintain buy
5223144 usb 3 0 is an answer to future the bandwidth need of the pc platform
5223145 it would be an enormous blockbuster drug with an initial market of around 2 0 billion dollars
5223146 we are hoping to delay or prevent those complications which would basically keep those patients off dialysis which would have a huge benefit for their lifestyle
5223147 so we can look at it now and say there are x number of veterans who are coming back on a regular basis from afghanistan we can look at the figures and say well there arent that many at the moment that are presenting with problems
5223148 but what we can say with some confidence is that over the coming five to 10 years a lot more of those people will have problems

5223245 io cosa sono se non uno scrittore portoghese scrivo in portoghese penso in portoghese sento in portoghese le traduzioni non mi hanno trasformato in cosmopolita
5223246 non giocando al casino n comprando macchine di lusso o televisioni siamo cos abituati al fatto che gli scrittori debbano essere poveri che ogni volta che uno scrittore dispone di pi soldi del normale gli chiedono cosa intenda farne ma perch queste domande non le fate mai a tennisti e calciatori
5223247 lunione europea ho detto spesso terr in pochissimo conto i rapporti di potere fra i diversi paesi che la compongono ci saranno paesi forti e paesi deboli che dovranno obbedire in europa si sta consolidando un potere che riduce i cittadini a consumatori in una cornice mondiale che tra lindifferenza generale sta distruggendo sistematicamente volont ideologie coscienze

5223250 lei non ha studiato lettere ma meccanica anzitutto come mai
5223251 che influsso hanno avuto questi studi sulla sua produzione letteraria
5223252 come mai ha scelto una professoressa di matematica per il ruolo della suicida in
5223253 e come mai un professore di matematica a suggerire al protagonista del suo ultimo romanzo
5223254 crede che sia solo un caso che in un mondo tecnologico e scientifico molti grandi scrittori o abbiano fatto studi scientifici da musil a gadda o abbiano mostrato un grande interesse per questioni scientifiche da borges a calvino
5223255 a proposito di borges che ruolo svolge il libro di herbert quain
5223256 il mistero della scrittura che in essa non c alcun mistero
5223257 lunico senso intimo delle cose che non hanno nessun senso intimo
5223258 il mistero delle cose che cosa mai il mistero lunico mistero che ci sia qualcuno che pensa al mistero
5223259 e perch quellaffermazione si trova allinterno di un libro i cui tre livelli quello di saramago quello dello storico e quello del revisore si intrecciano invece molto misteriosamente
5223260 si riconoscerebbe almeno per quanto riguarda la sua produzione a partire da
5223261 quali sono i suoi rapporti personali con la pittura che svolge un ruolo importante nel
5223262 e quali sono i suoi rapporti personali con la religione da ateo che ha per scritto un poetico
5223263 qual il suo pensiero sulla globalizzazione alla quale in un certo senso dedicata

5223268 in the short term we expect prices to remain high relative to historical levels albeit with higher volatility
5223269 conditions in some of our markets deteriorated during the first half of 2008 our growth rates have slowed
5223270 we proved we can move the ball but you just cant turn it over
5223271 mama this is the first time i have been pain free this medicine just might really help me
5223272 this is a wonderful medicine used appropriately but an unforgiving medicine used inappropriately
5223273 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
5223274 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
5223275 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
5223276 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
5223277 we would have no reason to suspect that the dosing regimen
5223278 as soon as we became aware of deaths due to misprescribing for pain patients we began the process of instituting label changes
5223279 i dont think a drug that requires such a level of sophistication to use is what id call cheap because of the risks
5223280 given the medicines he was on his brain forgot to tell his heart to beat and his lungs to pump
5223281 i never had any idea of the risk nor did my husband
5223282 we know that a significant share of the methadone deaths involve doctors making well intended prescriptions
5223283 we have this perception that we are into sports that were a sports minded country but when you look at it inactivity and obesity are a real challenge to this country
5223284 not only would it increase the pool of future olympians but it would make a dent in rising obesity and diabetes rates

5223287 before you bella my life was like a moonless night
5223288 i couldnt understand a word she was saying she was appalling
5223289 it was an insult to the fans to come on and do a performance like that
5223290 she looked like you just wanted to put her in the bath
5223291 we want the government to listen to us for fairness equity and justice to prevail
5223292 that time they saw nothing wrong in condemning the same allowances because it was them who were receiving that money they are now portraying that the allowances are new
5223293 this is where i challenge you the media to bring this to the fore we zambians should not allow people who have political interest to cheat us
5223294 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5223295 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5223296 i pray the government stops this down sliding and take the country out of this crisis

5223328 we use the word enchanting a lot in the boucheron vocabulary
5223329 and theres something so enchanting about the stage and cabaret
5223330 we wanted to offer a space for our more discreet clients
5223331 you cant really get any better than j j abrams as a producer on television or film alias was pretty damn good lost is excellent and felicity was good as well hes definitely made his mark on television that is the difficulty of television maintaining quality and being able to keep cranking these things out that is the thing that has held me back over the last few years from working in television is knowing the amount of work that goes into it and how difficult it is to keep something good fresh and interesting for the audience
5223332 i had auditioned for star trek which i think was sort of my audition for the series nobody will say that but i think that is the truth as much as i am enjoying working for j j and bad robot right now he is like a hunted man everything that he does or writes down people are trying to get on the internet i have never dealt with so much security my script has my name printed on it they have to change the letters inside the script to serialize them so they know who leaked it in case it gets out i also had to sign a non disclosure agreement for when i get my script every week
5223333 we use the microfiches in hereford now but it takes a long time and it is not always legible
5223334 i started nursery know it all to give new and expectant parents the support and confidence they need so that they can concentrate on a more important role parenting
5223335 with everything online these days parents spend a lot more time than theyd like just researching ideas products and things to be aware of
5223336 but nursery know it all has already tried these products sifted through information and spent the countless hours doing this legwork for them
5223337 with more dual income households families being spread out and our lives getting busier parents are finding themselves stressed out by the to do list for parenthood
5223338 a service like nursery know it all means that busy parents get to spend more quality time with each other enjoying pregnancy rather than spending countless hours researching and searching for products services and childcare
5223339 my husband and i found all the new baby things a parent needs to buy so overwhelming nursery know it all provided us with helpful advice and guidance and it was an unbelievable time saver it was a more personalized experience unlike just reading a book
5223340 as a first time mom i spent hours pouring over all of the books that recommend the best baby products but once i walked into the store i was so overwhelmed and confused kim took me through everything she helped me choose products based on what i needed now and what id need six months from now ive since had my second child and again used the services of nursery know it all to better understand what i need and dont need for two young children
5223341 as a mother of three young children i know how stressful having a baby can be not only are you adapting to your new role of motherhood and the changing family dynamic whether its your first or your fifth child but the little things like thank you cards researching childcare options and buying things like cribs and strollers can take hours of time to research and can get really overwhelming

5223353 stuart gosling made a vid a few years back using three dv cameras set up to shoot three angles at the same time and i wanted to do something similar but green screen so we had lots of guitar arms sticking out at the same time
5223354 feeder always seem to look really morose and sombre in their vids so we wanted to do something fun where they looked like they were having a good time
5223355 finally the graphics card just gave up and started making noises like harrier jump jet
5223356 we used after effects to comp it all together which is a brilliant programme but when you have 150 layers all with names like wide g f wide g l wide g r you start to lose the plot really quickly
5223357 ive never felt like id bitten off way more than i could chew this badly before i was just seeing layers and stupid 3d camera moves and every time you made a mistake it disrupted
5223358 there are lots of references to old feeder videos like buck rogers and come back around but i just like the fact that all the technical stuff is technically wrong the keying is crap the grading had to be done on a laptop because everything else was broken and everythings just thrown on top of everything else normally you edit the shots you want but here i just put every take in the video but somehow it all hangs together

5223377 history repeats itself this time it is an aptly named corporation imperial that with blind ruthlessness and staggering cynicism has destroyed not just one of the last local examples of steam driven industry but crushed a place where south african history converged the struggle of poor people to earn an honest living colonial segregation indifference displacement discrimination lack of compassion and the eventual disintegration of the amawasha
5223378 knowing the truth is a complex and difficult process but its indispensable if we are to build a space for encounter and consensus a space that allows us to affirm that democracy belongs to all of us the state has a clear obligation to pass on to new generations the ethical principles of truth justice and reparation
5223379 emphasises the curious run of a thoroughfare on the municipal maps
5223380 and it seems to have been treated as something of a land
5223381 further laws however such as the gold law of 1908 and the asiatic land tenure and trading amendment act of 1919 imposed new restrictions on indians yet again little if anything was done to enforce them trading licences continued to be issued and no alternative areas were offered from the beginning therefore many indians effectively owned white property through nominees business knew no real boundaries and as the town centre meanwhile shifted eastwards across towards rissik and eloff streets the asians of diagonal street were left undisturbed
5223382 landlords stopped spending money on any but essential maintenance rebuilding was in any case forbidden and the quarter became progressively more shabby diagonal street is dying a much slower death than pageview but the story is one of equally dreary misguidance sections still flourish others have been laid bare or rebuilt but the whole area is inexorably earmarked for redevelopment with it will disappear a uniquely colourful part of johannesburgs business area
5223383 it is vibrant and alive and colourful peopled by a hotchpotch of many races religions and cultures to whom diagonal street is a way of life nothing special just a few rows of shops that they and their fathers have always patronised for their daily needs
5223384 i felt a shock of anticipation as i walked into the cool depths of a shop stocked from floor to ceiling with bolts of cotton cloth mostly african prints i pass time in a wholesale and retail merchants shop in which the scene must be familiar to travellers from hong kong cairo or mombassa wherever asians ply their trade
5223385 the victorian shops between pritchard and president streets with their balconies filigree iron work and the colourful cairo style fruit market dating back to 1896

5223394 god the failed hypothesis how science shows that god does not exist
5223395 i am convinced that in the extended criterion set for the release of prisoners with blood on their hands we could find people who have not murdered israelis or others
5223396 the release of prisoners is not interpreted as a gesture but rather as weakness the state of israel released hundreds of prisoners in recent months and the situation of abu mazen palestinian president mahmoud abbas has not changed gilad shalit is still in his kidnappers hands
5223397 when israel frees prisoners to weak elements without demanding anything in return they remain weak this is a decision conveying weakness and an acceptance of the existing situation why are we helping abu mazen instead of taking care of gilad shalits release first
5223398 in order to achieve our goal which is security we must hold negotiations which include a return negotiations with results rather than diplomacy which yields nice photo opportunities we hear about negotiations being held for more than a year but what has changed what results have we achieved what progress have we made this year
5223399 we are delighted to be working with africa investor to encourage private sector participation in the africa unions industrialisation strategy we too believe that private african enterprise and investment is the key to solving africas problems by working together with african companies and other international organisations we are tackling common challenges like the food crisis

5223410 we have slashed rates across the range to provide real value to our members and new borrowers to suit a variety of needs
5223411 at the moment it is cheaper to fund fixed rate mortgages over the long term so we are looking at a return to long term fixed rate mortgages from 15 to 25 years as we believe they will offer great value and be in greater demand than previously
5223412 many people are loyal to their bank and go to them for everything from their current account to their mortgage and credit card however by doing so you could find yourself seriously out of pocket as the big named banks do not tend to have the best rates
5223413 by shopping around and opting for the best buys you could save yourself substantial amounts of money
5223414 consumers who are loyal to halifax are the hardest hit finding themselves over 5k worse off with royal bank of scotland customers not far behind at nearly 3
5223415 the big banks trade on their names and it is disappointing that they do not offer more competitive deals to their customers
5223416 particularly when shopping for a mortgage customers need to make sure they do their homework in order to secure the best deal possible mortgage brokers do not have access to 100 of deals so borrowers should make sure they are aware of what deals are available direct from lenders
5223417 the institutions are keen to tempt savings and current account customers through their doors and as a result have made switching as easy as possible current account institutions have switcher services which transfer your existing regular payments for you

5223419 sellers coming to the market in the middle of the summer holiday season tend to be more motivated
5223420 whilst those who do not have to sell are holding off sellers who are also looking to buy are strongly placed to negotiate an equal or larger reduction in the price of the property they are buying in addition buyers currently benefit from the best choice in years for example properties that are architecturally desirable or in tight school catchment areas are increasingly attainable buyers with specific requirements should take a long term view to try and secure their dream home
5223421 despite some deals being done at prices that begin to address affordability concerns the number of transactions this year is in danger of being the lowest since 1959 this raises serious questions as to whether any short term incentives by individual uk entities such as the government or the bank of england would be effective in speeding up the market recovery against the backdrop of the global problems of the credit crunch
5223422 whilst a marked slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut when inflation peaks the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threats of a serious and prolonged recession
5223423 the longer the mpc waits before cutting rates the bigger the danger that the economic situation would deteriorate
5223424 our quarterly economic forecast highlights a significant worsening in uk economic prospects there is now a distinct possibility of technical recession
5223425 the level of uk unemployment is likely to increase to nearly 300 000 over the next few years reaching almost two million an increase above two million cannot be ruled out
5223426 over the next two or three quarters we expect uk gdp growth to be slightly negative or zero thereafter we expect a shallow recovery but the period of weak below trend growth is likely to be prolonged lasting until the final months of 2009 or early in 2010
5223427 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation the uk economy urgently needs an interest rate cut to counter threats of recession
5223428 our central scenario envisages that the uk bank rate would be cut to 4 75 per cent in quarter four 2008 followed by an additional cut to 4 50 per cent in quarter one 2009
5223429 a marked slowdown in uk activity is highly likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut in line with our central forecast but if the mpc decides not to cut rates in the next three to six months growth prospects would be worse than in our central scenario
5223430 the chancellor will probably confirm in his next pre budget report pbr that the governments fiscal rules will be altered acknowledging that the original fiscal rules would be breached at least temporarily
5223431 the second wave of energy price rises has put the final nail in the coffin for affordable energy
5223432 households who are concerned about their jobs their homes and their ongoing ability to pay their bills will be left with no choice but to cut back on both heating and eating this winter
5223433 with energy bills continuing to burn a hole in households dwindling pockets consumers need to take steps to minimise their energy usage and reduce the amount they pay
5223434 lending organisations should take brands as value in the balance sheet and probably adopt new lending methods
5223435 lending organisations must have a long term view and address investment opportunities
5223436 today the tea industry is no longer with a begging bowl but creating great opportunities there are great opportunities in backing this industry right from the plantations to exporters in getting modern equipment like tea bagging machines
5223437 but banks perceptions of financial instruments from the middle east is negative and they demand high premiums
5223438 this pushes up our costs and has a negative impact on our margins so it is vital to recognise the middle east as a vital market for tea
5223439 because of this attitude dubai plays a key entrepot role as a purveyor of our teas and is reducing our opportunities for direct dealings in these markets
5223440 this is a matter that needs to be addressed by the government and perhaps by underwriting such lending
5223441 of course it wouldnt hurt my feelings if you went ahead and bought the book now heres the link to it on barnes amp noble com

5223444 we really tried to make it work but in the end it just was not possible without severe ramifications elsewhere
5223445 their deadline must have been earlier than the decision than when we started to get serious about making the decision
5223446 i get the thing well mr eastwood is so well beloved and this may have ramifications at academy time
5223447 but its over i said what i had to say he believes what he believes and thats that
5223448 i am leaving with the satisfaction that whatever i could do for this country i did it with integrity
5223449 i am a human too i could have made mistakes but i believe that the people will forgive me
5223450 it should have happened much earlier the dictatorship should have been done away with sometime ago
5223451 driving the r8 is like smearing honey into keira knightly

5223454 i like this ride i like horses but these ones arent real
5223455 yup real ones are much bigger probably twice as big as these horses
5223456 as the cost of living is on the up these figures even if they are only part reflective of pensioners as a whole are of real concern
5223457 the cost of living for the elderly has surpassed inflation over the past decade therefore it is more important than ever that consumers are aware of the dangers of approaching retirement with such large amounts of debt
5223458 well it looks like youre on a cardiac diet which means you cant have caffeine
5223459 you asked me what i wanted and i want coffee
5223460 this is ridiculous ive been drinking coffee every morning for the last sixty years i want my coffee
5223461 sir you are on a cardiac diet that means that you cant have caffeine or extra sodium or fat it could make your condition worse
5223462 well your doctor needs to put it into our computer otherwise i could lose my job
5223463 sir i know youre lying otherwise you wouldnt be on this diet

5223473 good drive to the donut shop now do you see a cell phone store
5223474 it has taken the jse longer than anticipated to get the new system implemented
5223475 however since this was a total replacement of the 15 year old system we inherited when the jse bought safex and not merely an upgrade we had to be absolutely certain that wed catered for the needs of the equity derivatives market which are quite different today than they were 15 years ago
5223476 the flexibility of the new system allows us to introduce even more product innovation and hence should bring increased liquidity to the market something which any world class exchange strives to achieve
5223477 as the 11th largest derivatives exchange in the world by volume weve always recognised that one of the ways to remain one of the worlds leading exchanges is to ensure that we use technology to our advantage
5223478 options trading volumes using complex delta neutral products have also been improved
5223479 to attract further liquidity the system is focused on maximizing the number of prices displayed by using complex algorithms
5223480 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

5223483 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
5223484 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
5223485 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
5223486 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
5223487 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
5223488 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
5223489 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
5223490 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
5223491 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
5223492 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
5223493 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
5223494 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce

5223507 our starting five you put that starting five anywhere in the world and were going to win

5223509 go with both chrises and you throw in dwyane wade its unbelievable
5223510 his athletic ability his speed he looks like a rookie out there
5223511 i think our bench has been able to give our starters a lift because our starters have to be out there to start the game and sometimes other teams give them their best shot
5223512 we come in and give them a lift and then they come back in and blow it wide open for us in the third quarter
5223513 were all studs we come in the game with the same mentality the same confidence that we play with back with our nba teams when we come in we try to give them a lift
5223514 when we come off the bench we really try to come in with a lot of intensity especially on the defensive end
5223515 the starters they get our team going when we come in we want to be that second wave if the other team still has their starters in were bringing in fresh legs
5223516 for 40 minutes we want it to be non stop movement just chaos thats what were trying to do we wreak havoc

5223534 raad eens hoe veilig die instanties zijn voor dns aanvallen niet
5223535 de procedure van het aanvragen van ssl certificaten door instanties moet onder de loep worden genomen en minder geautomatiseerd verlopen er valt te denken aan extra authenticatie en identificatie van de aanvrager door de leverancier op dit moment verschillen de procedures van de cas certificate authority veel van elkaar bij de een gebeurt het grondiger dan bij de ander
5223536 hoewel dit scenario heel omslachtig is doordat eerst de server van de leverancier van ssl certificaten moet worden gecompromitteerd is het niet ondenkbaar in dat geval is het onmogelijk om als eindgebruiker iets te doen om het op te merken en te voorkomen het compromitteren van de server van ssl certificatenleveranciers is overigens niet zomaar gebeurd als we ervan uit mogen gaan dat die vanwege de aard van hun dienstverlening goed beveiligd zijn naar onze mening is dit scenario wel een aanleiding om daar extra alert op te zijn
5223537 zolang alle controles die een certificerende instantie uitvoert om de identiteit van een aanvrager te achterhalen over internet verlopen is het gevaar dat een malafide persoon een certificaat ontvangt voor een domein dat niet van hem is niet geheel academisch
5223538 blijft een feit dat we het risico van deze tijdrovende manier van frauderen niet hoog inschatten vanwege de complexiteit en de inspanning die het kost wij zien als govcert dat phishing zonder ssl certificaat al lucratief genoeg blijft veel mensen controleren helemaal niet of ze veilig aan het werk zijn daarom blijft het op dit moment een goed advies om als eindgebruiker te checken of er een beveiligde verbinding tot stand is gekomen via het hangslotje https en de url het zou de eerste bijna automatische handeling moeten zijn van iedere internetgebruiker
5223539 veel gebruikers controleren niet eens of het slotje aanwezig is als je als crimineel erin slaagt internetgebruikers om te leiden naar een nepbankiersite en dat kan via het lek van dan kaminsky dan heb je dus ook al een aardige kans van slagen
5223540 de nederlandse banken doen er alles aan om er voor te zorgen dat de producten die zij hun klanten bieden goed en veilig zijn dit geldt uiteraard ook voor internetbankieren honderd procent veiligheid kunnen wij niet garanderen maar wij zijn ons ook bewust van de gevaren die bijvoorbeeld internetbankieren met zich mee kan brengen daarom investeren wij als banken jaarlijks fors in het optimaliseren en de beveiliging van onze producten en helpen wij onze klanten bij het bestrijden van onder andere internetfraude door middel van campagnes als 3x kloppen bovendien heeft elke bank een vulnerabilitymanagementproces ingericht om de interne infrastructuur te beschermen tegen nieuwe kwetsbaarheden waaronder die in de dns omgeving

5223642 i think everyone was disappointed with thursday so we had a few scores to settle at rushden
5223643 on the one hand declining birth rates and a strong tendency towards the two child norm has led to a standardisation in birth patterns on the other hand the increasing instability of partnerships has resulted in the individuals experience of the family often becoming much more turbulent and diverse than before people often enter into several different relationships during the course of their lives and also experience a very varied range of family constellations ranging from the classic father mother child family to the patchwork family
5223644 the high quality and sheer scale of the ehf survey will allow us to identify the full spectrum of paths families follow including those which are rather more unusual we can study the data provided by 380 000 men and women who were asked about their origins children partnerships and social background one key factor is that in contrast to other surveys there is a relatively large body of data available on men in addition to identifying general family models this means we will also be able to reveal potential differences in the family biographies of men and women

5223680 rapideye is the first operational small satellite constellation developed by mda the development of the rapideye constellation including the ground planning and processing system represents a breakthrough in offering world class data from a turn key mission we are proud to have worked with rapideye to enable their mission
5223681 the result of our cooperation with mda is a satellite constellation that will collect massive amounts of earth observation data we have the ability to cover an area over 11 times the size of germany every day and our satellites which were constructed by british satellite specialists sstl will be controlled directly from our headquarters here in brandenburg an der havel
5223682 we will be able to deliver data about a customers area of interest as often as they need it quickly and at a very competitive cost
5223683 with our system we will close the gap that has been existent for a long time between the commercial and the scientific communities in the area of geoinformation services as our imagery is the next generation of optical earth observation

5223790 as the world flips over from a predominantly rural to a predominantly urban population base cities are going to take more and more water for agriculture
5223791 however most of the water going into urban areas comes out the other end in the sewers
5223792 we know that there is an informal sector within many cities that is using wastewater to grow vegetables but there has been no data on how much of this water was being used or what the risks were
5223793 it is a pretty useful way of treating water in the sense that if the water just went straight into a river it would cause a lot more eutrophication problems further downstream
5223794 so in a way it is performing an ecological service by cleaning up some of the water and recycling the nutrients
5223795 if this practice is going to be increasingly commonplace and more and more people are going to be eating food produced this way then there needs to be a bit more concern about the heavy metals and other contaminants in there
5223796 ideally the end product should be treating the water to a standard that means there is no risk but most developing nations cannot afford to do this
5223797 apparently what happens now in areas with very polluted water is that the farmers do a smell test or a taste test
5223798 if the water tastes too foul or smells too bad then they wont use it to irrigate their crops but thats a pretty dangerous way to go about things
5223799 it is really just about minimising the risks from field to fork with a series of simple measures
5223800 these include letting the water settle in a pond so a lot of the eggs from worms drop out of the water and irrigating around the crops rather than on top of them
5223801 when the crop is harvested it also needs to be washed with fresh clean water in the market and that water needs to be constantly changed so everything else is not contaminated
5223802 ive never had nerves like that before watching was worse than having a baby more painful
5223803 petes only goal was gold nothing less would do its been a really emotional rollercoaster and im so proud of what hes done
5223804 the biggest thing of the finish for me was tj tom james shouting yeah in the bowseat were getting them with 300 metres to go
5223805 and then i said to myself right lets not settle for silver lets have the gold lets do them
5223806 this is so special ill remember it my whole life i cant get enough of seeing hodgey and tj and steve with that big gold medal round their necks
5223807 when they crossed the line we were about six inches off the ground we were all hugging each other it was superb
5223808 this weeks been like nothing else surreal one day were in gloucestershire at home next morning were in beijing thousands of miles away watching my son who has done nothing but prepare himself for the last four years for winning the olympic title
5223809 in the first part of the race we were straining to hear the commentator because the aussie fans next to us were roaring their heads off that they were in the lead
5223810 then when they came into sight with 500m to go and were stepping up the pace the gb fans erupted and we were all on our feet shouting
5223811 they had to pull out all the stops but they showed real guts and great mental strength to win through and im so happy
5223812 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5223813 researchers local residents and volunteers have identified these important areas which cover most of the population range in nova scotia

5223815 it was only a fun thing i was saying to people hello im a penguin and my ice cap has melted so ive ended up in telford can i give you a leaflet people were loving it
5223816 what we have to look at is the reality on the ground and not the special pleading from vested interests
5223817 i think the correct balance is served for the public
5223818 we know what is meant to be dealt with in summary justice reforms that it should be less serious offences that it will not be domestic violence that it will not be serious assaults it will not be sexual assaults
5223819 we cant go back to the situation where we routinely had lawyers tendering pleas of not guilty and anything up to 18 months later the accused put their hands up and had a fine imposed for a relatively minor offence
5223820 this isnt just about looking after the interests of lawyers for the accused
5223821 we have to fundamentally look after the interests of our community
5223822 we have heard all sorts of rumours as to what these guidelines are famously the three stitch rule
5223823 if someone is the victim of an assault but the resulting injury does not require three stitches or more then its appropriate for a person to be issued with a fixed penalty
5223824 our suspicion is that it is in the guidelines and the real reason why these guidelines are not being disclosed is that the public would be frankly disgusted at the way in which they are treating cases of this nature
5223825 that rumour could really only be suggested by someone who did not understand the way in which these decisions are taken
5223826 you take into account the nature of the injury thats caused but in no way would you as a prosecutor take a decision based on whether its a particular number of stitches or a different number of stitches
5223827 if youve never ridden the train in your life or if you dont even like the train look at this from self interest and greed
5223828 this program is as real as it gets its the time for you to start focusing on how to get involved not just as users
5223829 when it comes to the challenges of ownership i think that decentralization of ec aid is an important factor decentralization to the delegations so that the dialogue can take place on a level where the partnership is taking place and that goes for all the member states but certainly for the governments and the civil society and that is something for what we have to work stronger for the decentralization of the delegations
5223830 if an employer can manipulate or intimidate its employees into voting one way or another it seriously undermines political democracy
5223831 gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
5223832 we believe that if the fec looks into this they will find what weve known all along that we did nothing wrong
5223833 he means by which the entrepreneur creates new wealth producing resources or endows existing resources with enhanced potential for creating wealth
5223834 all individuals within an organization are assigned a special set of objectives that they try to reach during a normal operating period these objectives are mutually set upon and agreed upon by individuals and their managers
5223835 what do they need and want to get out of their work
5223836 the extent to which ngos are able to organize themselves around broad networks focusing on specific issues will have a bearing on the form and impact of their involvement in the work of the organization
5223837 the economic informational and intellectual resources of ngos have garnered them enough expertise and influence to assume authority in matters that traditionally have been solely within the purview of state administration and responsibility
5223838 what we need to do is inquire of the army or all of the military if they know of any more situations like this that need fixing
5223839 es lief noch nicht alles rund aber vor eigenem publikum werden wir viel besser spielen ich glaube wir k nnen es drehen und den titel gewinnen

5223842 how good migration governance can contribute to development and how development policies can impact on migration
5223843 the presence of the international migrants alliance in all global regions will pose the most formidable challenge to the global forum on migration and development we being the grassroots migrants who are at the receiving end of numerous anti migrant attacks are the living proofs of the global forum on migration and developments anti migrant agenda and direction

5223863 morale is high at barnsley the dressing room is fine theyre disappointed they lost but they know theyre a good side
5223864 we never took our chances but conceded soft goals and if it means a change of personnel until we get it right then thats what well do

5223878 and thats just the beginning we contemplate printing nanowire sensor circuitry photosensors chemical sensors biosensors not on silicon but on paper or plastic tape this could be used easily and with instant results where spills have occurred or to test air quality or to test for disease organisms almost any use for a sensor that you can imagine

5223950 you and i both know that the worst thing in the field is a soldier worried about problems back home
5223951 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront

5223961 it is obvious to us that the predator control program as it currently exists is not a matter of scientific management but policy that is being basically stuffed down the people of alaskas throats by a well connected minority
5223962 it is a vestige of redneck alaska the old fashioned idea that wildlife is all for us and we can do whatever we want with it and blasting things indiscriminately is the alaska way of life and we are the supreme species
5223963 we are seeing cows that are birthing twin calves now
5223964 we are seeing a better survival rate for calves it has helped our moose population

5223970 the tone of voice the arrogance of that speech was just more than i could take
5223971 until everyone in the union says were going to take back america from washington d c were in the game
5223972 i think don and ted are two very strong people who know how the system works
5223973 earmarks as far as that goes thats the way the nation is run and i dont think mr young has done anything outside the norm
5223974 when you are one among 435 you had better be outspoken or strong
5223975 i think alaskans understand that translates into getting alaskas issues solved
5223976 his demeanor has not been very open to his constituents
5223977 don young has done good things over the years but at this point i think its time for a change

5223988 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5223989 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5223990 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5223991 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5223992 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5223993 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5223994 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5223995 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere

5223999 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5224000 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5224001 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5224002 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile

5224172 as far as ratings are concerned we have always played fair and looked at long term ratings rather than just a few weeks therefore if you look at our overall performance through the year it has been positive and we have been number one and number two channels right from january june 2008 all india all secs 4 14 cartoon network and pogos combined shares in 1 jan 1 30 jun 2008 stood at 43 per cent in all india 41 per cent in hsm and 48 per cent in south india

5224175 cartoon network and pogo witnessed a 10 per cent growth during the ipl
5224176 we are specifically catering to the southern markets with tamil and telugu language feeds and the active viewing day part of cartoon network is already available in these two languages apart from english in the other two southern states this has helped us build strong bonds with kids in south india and provides us with an opportunity to showcase their favourite programming in their preferred language
5224177 of the top 100 transmissions for the first half of the year 2008 73 have been from cartoon network and 4 from pogo our top shows and characters include tom amp jerry cat and mouse full house ben 10 and from pogo the movie krrish chhota bheem and mr bean
5224178 we are still experimenting with shows we will soon secure our position in the top slot
5224179 none of our shows are action based they are all educational and apt for family viewing we have a variety of shows like puppets 2d 3d and clay cartoons and these are all educational and for family viewing
5224180 we are broadly questioning these people about their links and their involvement direct or indirect in bomb blasts in jaipur and other places

5224195 i dont want the people of pakistan to slide deeper and deeper into uncertainty
5224196 for the interest of the nation i have decided to resign as president
5224197 i am not asking for anything i will let the people of pakistan decide my future
5224198 it will be accepted there is no second opinion about that
5224199 after the elections the nation wanted solutions from the new government
5224200 but the politicians could not do so a personal vendetta was started
5224201 i am confident that not a single charge can stand against me
5224202 i have not done anything for my personal gain whatever i have done i have done it for pakistan
5224203 leading pakistan is not an easy task and anyone doing it comes under a lot of criticism
5224204 in the start most pakistanis were for him and he still has some supporters especially because the new government which promised to do things differently has failed to do much in the past 100 days in power
5224205 he wanted to serve the country and to be different
5224206 he brought parliamentary reforms he brought women into the parliament
5224207 he in a way always believed in a unity of command a very centralized command which means his command in fact
5224208 this is where he went wrong and he underestimated the value of democracy
5224209 i might have made some mistakes but the people of pakistan will forgive me
5224210 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

5224222 the war is terrifying horrifying for civilians and we cant let it go on the french presidency of the european union council like all the countries of the eu is concerned and sometimes indignant at what is happening on its doorstep we must therefore try together with the americans and with the russians of course who are a participant in this conflict to stop the killing

5224225 a civil servant is supposed to work for the people and not use his position for his own benefit

5224308 were really proud to be in the same league as these amazing women
5224309 we went to lake casitas two years ago i believe on a training trip
5224310 i bottled a couple bottles of the water from there and i brought it all the way over here sprinkled a little bit on everybodys fingers and legs i mean im not superstitious or anything i think the key was hard work but it might have helped a little bit
5224311 before we left princeton we all gathered together at my house and we watched the race it was very inspiring just to see those women be so cool and resilient and just pulling through at the last bit
5224312 thats what we kind of envisioned during the first part of the race where we just wanted to think about us for what we could do i made a call for the 1984 girls and were gonna do them proud and we just started motoring to the finish line
5224313 the first thing you want to do is jump out of the boat and jump out of your skin but you dont have enough energy left to do it
5224314 we knew if we raced a perfect race things were possible
5224315 we kept trying really hard until the end and it feels great
5224316 romania has won the gold medal for so many years and we hoped to do the same
5224317 but theyve just able to focus on what they need to do theyre very professional but the most professional group ive ever worked with no fear they came down smiling to the boat house which was a good sign
5224318 it was weird in the first 500 we were up ahead and we were prepared for anything we were prepared to be down prepared to be ahead and nobody turned their head to another boat
5224319 we were streamlined we just looked straight ahead i cant really remember any other boats out there to be honest because it was all about how fast we could go it was the most beautiful peace
5224320 our goal was to not lose any ground we just wanted to row our race and we did we got faster every 500 it felt like we got faster but i dont know it got harder every 500 put it that way
5224321 i kept looking around and just feeling our length and then speed and just knowing how commanding it was
5224322 and i just started smiling everybody smiled because this was a sweet rhythm and it just gives them confidence i mean i was almost having to be the calming aspect because they were ramping it up and we just needed to let that hunter go and just force that rhythm and just let that rhythm go and it was nice
5224323 i visualized every night that i would be first across the line and i would be able to see everybody in my peripheral vision
5224324 thats the great thing about being in that bow seat you can see everybody ahead of you and if they were making a move gosh dang it im gonna make a move harder than that
5224325 so it was fun it was fun being back there watching all that unfold we saw romania push we saw netherlands push but i think we had an answer
5224326 hes been the one the voice in the back of my head
5224327 i think this medal is more his than mine i think its all my familys its not my medal i think i share it with a lot of people
5224328 im ready to put some more work in ive done extra workouts and i think those last 10 strokes thats all you think about you know what that was the day that i stayed after practice it all adds up
5224329 and if theres another athletic girl sitting there in modesto watching this thats how i got started so just try it you can be out here
5224330 its kind of like one of my bosses won the championship
5224331 it was special to win this tournament growing up here
5224332 i think 25 000 is about the number we can handle out here
5224333 its all going to be over within a couple of hours
5224334 thank you for letting it come back its something special
5224335 this is the first place i was ever exposed to the pga tour i loved it
5224336 its phenomenal what a great boost the tournament has been for businesses in the area
5224337 unfortunately some elements acting for vested interests levelled false allegations against me and deceived people
5224338 they said that during the last nine years our economic problems and electricity shortages were due to our policies it is absolutely wrong and deception for the country
5224339 they never realised that they could be successful against me but they never thought how detrimental it would be for the country

5224358 very much well definitely have one or two new signings before the transfer window closes i dont know what the wow signing is but i cant wait to ring him ashley when i get home
5224359 its a shame he told corporate guests before he let me and terry mac know
5224360 with dennis wise tony jiminez derek llambias and mike ashley were working really well to get quality players in
5224361 too often in the last few years newcastle have bought players who for whatever reason have not been quite good enough
5224362 sometimes they havent settled or seemed to have understood what it means to play for newcastle united i think the three weve got so far do and the next three must as well if that means waiting so be it
5224363 the fans have seen two or three new signings who they know have come to newcastle to play for the club in the right manner the journey home wont be quite so long but thats gone now weve got to go back home and start to build there because our home record last year wasnt good enough for newcastle united
5224364 guti rrez was fantastic i really like him i want to see him do his spiderman goal celebration because that means hes scored but i wont hold my breath because hes only got four goals in 90 games or something like that
5224365 hes a real team player from the minute he came to the club the boys accepted him straight away he just came in and instead of being a boy he was a man who knew he could play coloccinis the same guthrie did fantastic my man of the match
5224366 i wasnt worried about his match fitness hes a tremendous athlete
5224367 we didnt get him registered until friday so he couldnt train with the group and do any contact
5224368 but when you looked at him on saturday in training with the team i said to terry mac hell just love going to old trafford and he said he wanted to play that was it
5224369 ive only ever been once here and got something not having a go that was with manchester city and we wanted to and couldnt get the ball we drew 0 0
5224370 whatever manchester uniteds team is youve to have the courage to play you need a bit of luck and your top players to perform shay given kept us in it early on
5224371 we were very unlucky to lose the lead so quickly we only had 10 men on the pitch because steven taylor was off receiving treatment its hard enough 11 against 11 here
5224372 maybe if we could have just withstood that until steven could come back on we might have been talking about something even better than a draw but i think it was a fair result
5224373 we would like to thank everyone who has come forward with witness accounts so far we are very grateful for their assistance and will be contacting them later

5224381 it appears a cowardly attack the offender has walked straight up to the person there has been very little altercation or conversation and theres been one big king hit inspector rod kemp told reporters in brisbane
5224382 it appears that its merely been a case of someones backed in and taken a bowser ahead of someone else insp kemp said
5224383 this is one of the biggest fines thats ever been handed to a restaurant owner in the city
5224384 the size of the fine represents how seriously these offences are treated keeping a restaurant in such a filthy vermin infested state shows a wanton disregard for the health of the manchester residents and visitors to the city who eat there and this fine should send out a clear message that this sort of practice will not be tolerated and restaurant owners will be prosecuted

5224390 a intend versus a beatific football team im pleased with that we do poverty to ready in perspective that it was a preseason game although preseason games are important naturally in the utilization of the offense accumulation and special teams and the cohesiveness of the group
5224391 i thought we played very physical defensively we had several turnovers in the game some of it was our causing some of it was their mistakes nonetheless those were important we kept the yardage down
5224392 i saw several players attain some plays but i undergo one player that caught my attention on some plays was ray macdonald hes employed very substantially on the accumulation both on the base downs and in the sub package he entireness closely with justin smith the two of them are employed together substantially as far as pass rush situations whether its on the outside or whether its the inside they mix it up both
5224393 it really feels great its a blessing from god the cornerback tried to play me press and i beat him off the line our quarterback prefabricated a enthusiastic throw i meet went up to intend it
5224394 its football thats the artefact i countenance at it its football no matter where youre at god put me here to play this sport its football so were feat to play football meet same we play at home
5224395 i think i reinforced a lowercase bit since oakland i think i got more snaps than i did in the first game as the fourth quarter came i started effort a rhythm and effort a feel for the game so i was able to attain a pair of plays in the fourth quarter i feel i reinforced a lowercase bit but ive got a daylong artefact to go
5224396 it is about everybody doing what they are supposed to do trusting each other to be exactly where theyre supposed to be especially the panoramic receivers trusting the offensive distinction to hold up and protect same they did tonight and for us qbs to put the ball exactly where its supposed to be when all those things and the running game are jelling it is feat to be really fun to check this offense
5224397 it meet makes me excited every time im back there i undergo how close we are i undergo how beatific we could be i meet poverty to move to impact hard securing every catch securing the ball then breaking tackles its meet doing my part and not trying to do too much and meet effort positive yards every time
5224398 i think i did some things okay but the things that stick out in my mind are a pair of missed opportunities the daylong bomb to josh morgan and the high ball in the back of the end regularize to jason hill
5224399 i hope so it is hard to tell youre asking the criminal guy i think so from talking to coach nolan they talked about feat into the third preseason game and battling it out until then i meet hope i intend the opportunity to start
5224400 its effort there just with time and the reps feat over the playbook trying to understand what were trying to intend out of the plays and what we are trying to do the better i module get so absolutely im feeling more comfortable
5224401 protection wasnt very good they pushed in the pocket consistently really it was something that happened throughout the game and i thought the 49ers played at a higher take than us
5224402 i think he prefabricated some beatific throws he had some beatific timing throws he threw the ball right when vernon solon caught it he threw it right when he turned around so i would say he had beatific timing
5224403 awful awful awful awful i dont think we played well from terminal hebdomad we felt same we had a lowercase spark reaching into this week but as an offense we didnt play well

5224409 denn mit vattenfall und co kann es keinen wirklichen klimaschutz geben

5224423 you transform from being this healthy guy that might occasionally shoot someone in the knee to somebody thats literally dependent on being cruel and vicious twisted and deformed and vomiting all the time you invert your relationship with your own power from being powerful because youre healthy to powerful because youre crueler than the enemy

5224437 the champions league is like a carrot as well most players want to play there which makes it difficult for us to attract people the club are trying very hard to get the players in though
5224438 i am leaving with the satisfaction that whatever i could do for this country i did it with integrity
5224439 i am a human too i could have made mistakes but i believe that the people will forgive me
5224440 it should have happened much earlier the dictatorship should have been done away with sometime ago
5224441 blogging isnt for everyone for those who want more control over their online data and destiny i think blogs and blog based tools are the best route
5224442 the main aim will be to weaken americas position in the middle east in this respect there are differences of opinion in the kremlin some ex generals have come on record to the effect that a war with america is inevitable in a perspective of 10 15 years the influence of these radical military men should not be overrated but it is certainly true that the belief that america is russias worst and most dangerous enemy is quite common the downfall of the soviet empire is thought to be mainly if not entirely americas fault washington it is believed is trying to hurt russia all the time in every possible way
5224443 chiellini could just have a sprain on his left knee and we will do the necessary tests on monday afternoon
5224444 it may not be anything too serious we will see what the extent of the damage is and he may be out for around 40 days
5224445 we did well tonight to beat home united in bishan stadium because they are very strong here
5224446 we played our own passing game and found space that we quickly took advantage rafi alis return was important because he controlled the game likewise for zulkarnaen zainal who was solid at the back
5224447 i am frustrated by the way the team played in the first half
5224448 the players did not press hard for the ball lacked urgency and they looked second best throughout credit to tampines rovers they looked much sharper than us
5224449 the team that i picked out there does possess enough quality but now i need to find out why the players did not perform up to expectations
5224450 we definitely need to pick up the pieces thats where the real character of the team shows up and when i say team it means the players and it also includes me
5224451 do we wallow in self pity do finger pointing or find the resolve to come out stronger we will definitely need to work together in the next few days
5224452 this is a subject that pertains to the players exclusively
5224453 i dont want to do it they will be the ones who decide and whoever wants to be captain must thus step forward
5224454 i dont think we are done yet we have still got one or two players possibly to come in sir alex ferguson knows my intentions and knows where we stand as far as fraizer is concerned and hopefully it is in the same ball park as him

5224466 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5224467 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5224468 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5224469 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5224470 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
5224471 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
5224472 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5224473 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5224474 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5224475 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5224476 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5224477 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5224478 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5224479 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5224480 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5224481 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5224482 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5224483 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5224484 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5224485 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5224486 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
5224487 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
5224488 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
5224489 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
5224490 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
5224491 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5224492 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5224493 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5224494 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5224495 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5224496 as far as i know there is an existing ceasefire in place and the recent milf attack on government forces is a clear violation of this ceasefire agreement
5224497 we cannot afford renewed armed hostilities because this will only set back efforts to bring economic and social progress to muslim mindanao
5224498 very bad sign that the milf chain of command is breaking apart
5224499 these attacks should be condemned by everyone including the leaders of the milf these acts of criminality and terrorism by rebel muslim groups should be dealt with quickly and met frontally with the full force of the law
5224500 i urge president arroyo to immediately release funds from the emergency fund for the purpose of providing relief assistance
5224501 how can we proceed with the peace talks if the top officials of the milf cannot control their field commanders and are apparently acting on their own we really have to know first from the milf leaders if they are still in control those who are out of line should be relieved from their posts and should be punished by the milf leadership for breaking the chain of command
5224502 the government and our armed forces cannot afford now to deal with this kind of situation in kids gloves we want peace but when terrorism is the result of peace negotiations the terrorists must be stopped and subdued at all cost
5224503 even the top leaders of the milf should not let this incident pass this is an insult to their leadership clearly commander bravo is not inclined to respect the milf chain of command and this is a very serious offense in any military organization
5224504 i think it is because of the intense training if he had been more relaxed the injury might not have been so bad
5224505 i have experienced in the past the great pressure that government officials exert on the athletes as well as the coach and that they demand a gold medal otherwise it is meaningless liu xiang is still a young boy and he has been put under a bit too much expectation
5224506 he never had any injuries before he hurt his foot in june
5224507 but that injury was not too bad after the birds nest was finished he trained in the stadium in july and hurt his foot again
5224508 when you are faced with great pressure and intensive training all kinds of problems can arise
5224509 and if you are under great pressure before a big race it is difficult to get over your injuries quickly
5224510 he is respected and loved but he leads a really boring life and cannot go out much
5224511 he feels more relaxed when he races outside china it would be better if he was in an environment that is more like a foreign country with less attention
5224512 he is the only competitive athlete in chinas track and field team so he has been under constant pressure including from the high hopes of government officials
5224513 my worry is that government officials might complain about liu xiangs exit and harbour some negative feelings towards him
5224514 the government and the sports administration have to understand and be lenient because he has achieved so much
5224515 if they want him to come back to racing they need to work out a way to encourage him and console him they cannot push him into a corner since no one can win all of the time injuries are unavoidable
5224516 i think he did his best his injury must have been quite serious
5224517 i feel disappointed but it is not his fault or the coachs i think this has a lot to do with being at home in china and the pressure
5224518 kita dapat lihat hari ini seluruh kabinet malaysia turun ke permatang pauh dengan segala kekuatan mereka kita harus tanya mereka mahu lawan siapa mengapa mereka bersungguh mahu lawan kekuatan rakyat yang bermunajat kepada allah
5224519 mereka ada rm5 billion yang patut dicurahkan kepada rakyat tetapi mereka ambil rm5 bilion itu under memperkayakan anak pinak mereka
5224520 sebab kita bangkit kerana kita sebagai islam perlu bertanggungjawab kepada nasib masyarakat seluruhnya islam dan bukan islam islam harus dihayati hak kita mestsi dipertahankan bangsa kita mesti dipertahankan perpaduan dan kerukunan hidup antara kaum dan agama perlu dijaga seperti yang dituntut allah
5224521 kita nak tengok malam ini kekuatan kabinet di bawah pimpinan abdullah badawi atau kekuatan rakyat dengan izin allah
5224522 beliau adalah seorang aktivis presiden persatuan bahasa melayu di universiti malaya bahkan menjadi presiden gabungan mahasiswa islam gmi dan kerana itu beliau membawa kebangkitan mahasiswa demonstrasi 1974 dan lain lain lagi yang menjadi perhatian beliau adalah soal soal masyarakat soal kemiskinan soal negara
5224523 maka berdasarkan latarbelakang ini pertuduhan yang pertama dan siri kedua ini lebih tidak masuk akal lagi

5224530 engkel ballack bengkak luar biasa jadi saya sudah diberitahu tapi tampaknya cedera itu tidak berhubungan dengan cederanya yang sebelumnya
5224531 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5224532 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5224533 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5224534 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5224535 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5224536 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5224537 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5224538 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5224539 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5224540 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5224541 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5224542 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5224543 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5224544 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5224545 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5224546 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5224547 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5224548 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5224549 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5224550 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5224551 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5224552 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5224553 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5224554 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5224555 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5224556 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5224557 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

5224563 our results were outstanding in the context of a challenging supply environment which was characterised by unexpected disruptions rising input prices skills shortages and the further devaluation of the us dollar
5224564 however emerging market economies should remain relatively strong on the back of continued domestic infrastructure investment and regional trade
5224565 while short term disruptions may occur we expect that their long term economic growth will remain robust as they continue on the path to industrialisation

5224623 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5224624 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5224625 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5224626 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5224627 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5224628 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5224629 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5224630 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5224631 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5224632 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5224633 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5224634 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5224635 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5224636 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5224637 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5224638 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5224639 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5224640 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5224641 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5224642 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5224643 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5224644 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5224645 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5224646 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5224647 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5224648 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5224649 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5224650 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5224651 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5224652 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5224653 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5224654 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5224655 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5224656 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5224657 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5224658 i literally could not believe it i was meet praying the car was gonna hold together and i wasnt gonna intend a new caution but we got the employ done i feel really beatific about it and its meet a big displace for our team and it feels same everythings worth it today
5224659 its a big bad concern out here in nascar world and im meet pleased that im able to have a weekend same this to remember
5224660 when its all said and done ill be able to go home back to tasmania and tell them how beatific i was at watkins glen on one year
5224661 es lief noch nicht alles rund aber vor eigenem publikum werden wir viel besser spielen ich glaube wir k nnen es drehen und den titel gewinnen
5224662 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5224663 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5224664 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5224665 ni s a c ntat imnul n s li la bazine i pe stadioane cum noi n avem
5224666 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5224667 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5224668 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5224669 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5224670 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5224671 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5224672 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5224673 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5224674 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5224675 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5224676 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5224677 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5224678 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5224679 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5224680 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5224681 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5224682 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5224683 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5224684 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5224685 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5224686 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5224687 jag var 15 r och jobbade p huvudgatan d r jag s lde biljetter till nattklubbar med gratis kr ks shots som inkluderade alkohol
5224688 om jag ville ha publicitet skulle jag acceptera inbjudningar f r att inte n mna pengar f r att dyka upp p glamour sa tillst llningar
5224689 the saddleback civil forum offered the first chance to match the candidates
5224690 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5224691 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5224692 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5224693 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5224694 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5224695 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5224696 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5224697 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5224698 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5224699 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5224700 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5224701 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5224702 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5224703 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5224704 we could be considered the ebay of the golf ball world
5224705 we take something that might be considered worthless golf balls that have met with a watery grave and repackage them into a quality product
5224706 were very impressed with the great work the first tee has been doing
5224707 were proud to assist them as a preferred supplier as they continue to teach positive life lessons through golf instruction
5224708 we want to become customers one stop shop for all their golfing needs so were expanding our product selection to include golf bags training aids and golf apparel
5224709 we have recently grown our selection of novelty golf gifts and ensure shipping typically occurs within 24 hours of order placement with our customers and relationship with the first tee we love having the opportunity to help people pay it forward with their purchases
5224710 take away and swing at the ball with every ounce of power their arms can generate all of this with the hope of hitting a long drive this much physical effort in your arms creates the slowest possible arm movement just like trying to use your arm muscles to throw the ball a long way
5224711 how do my arms move if my shoulders are so relaxed

5224719 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
5224720 accept anything from anybody and assume its all of equal importance
5224721 with five blokes to every girl may i suggest that beauty disadvantaged women should proceed to mount isa
5224722 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5224723 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
5224724 its not councils view and its not mine its hard when youve got to defend something someone else has said were definitely appalled
5224725 look i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing at the right hand of god

5224729 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules
5224730 we are pleased to deepen this relationship and are confident that this transaction will create long term value for mufg shareholders while creating new opportunities for unionbancal employees and customers

5224740 the decision concerning a baby should be left to a woman but that he does not see himself as supportive of abortion
5224741 the bill was unnecessary in illinois and was introduced for political reasons
5224742 there was no documentation that hospitals were actually doing what was alleged in testimony presented before him in committee
5224743 would have taken away from doctors their professional judgment when a fetus is viable
5224744 physicians are already required to use life saving measures when fetuses are born alive during abortions
5224745 we worked with him specifically on his strategy the republicans were in control of the illinois senate at the time they loved to hold votes on partial birth and born alive they put these bills out all the time because they wanted to pigeonhole democrats
5224746 christ would not vote for barack obama because barack obama has voted to behave in a way that it is inconceivable for christ to have behaved
5224747 god does support people parties ideas and beliefs the entire purpose of the old testament

5224796 the puppys parents may push it to the ground when it does something wrong but that doesnt mean the puppy is doing moral reasoning our current theories of evolutionary psychology holds that moral reasoning arose as a response to more complex social challenges than that in their full fledged human form our moral adaptations are the result of selection pressures over linguistic arguments about tribal politics

5224802 in the book of optics ibn al haytham was the first scientist to argue that vision occurs in the brain rather than the eyes he pointed out that personal experience has an effect on what people see and how they see and that vision and perception are subjective he explained possible errors in vision in detail and as an example described how a small child with less experience may have more difficulty interpreting what he or she sees he also gave an example of how an adult can make mistakes in vision due to experience that suggests that one is seeing one thing when one is really seeing something else

5224827 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5224828 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5224829 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5224830 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5224834 we need to do a better job of letting people know whats going on
5224835 the rumors are there because people really wish it would happen
5224836 10 comics creators we wish would make movies instead of frank miller dont hold out hope for a serenity sequel says joss whedon i predict this holiday
5224837 those rumors are just rumors and i dont think theyre going to stop no matter how many times i say no its not happening because somebody will say he said yes his eyes said yes his nose said yes there was a yes iness about him because people want it
5224838 meets a burger mad marshall while on his quest to find the restaurant where he had his very first new york burger
5224839 i was playing one of those huge rock clubs called metro 107 in miami i met this cuban german girl at least that was the heritage she claimed named marie incredibly hot dark skin blue eyes fucking amazing skin flawless retarded how pretty she was i mean i was already a road dog at the time but regardless my heart would literally skip a beat when i saw her that kind of hot dig
5224840 that night we ended up going back to her place at like 5 60am she had a condo in sofi area of south beach i guess she was a model and her papa was in the export biz blah blah anyway total femme fatale in the classic sense she had me doing things that i wouldnt normally do
5224841 she used to cry when either of us would cum
5224842 sometimes she would literally beg me into every inch of her other times shed be all nadia doing gymnastics
5224843 wait she cried like really cry with sounds or just tears
5224844 anyway i started noticing the different behavior patterns in her
5224845 the mannerisms body language timing the different cock sucking technique i mean i noticed em before but i guess i shrugged em off
5224846 uh huh so your hot girl had multiple personality disorder
5224847 i thought so then the big reveal one night im introduced to adriana and alegria my mind froze i was like uh twins
5224848 please please tell me there is a threesome in this story
5224849 adriana is watching now enjoying seeing her sister get fucked hard from behind
5224850 can never ever forget the visual of two perfect and nearly identical girls giving me head at the same time
5224851 can you fathom the one thing that really stands out the one thing that stands out was me cumming and both of them taking turns milking me dry of every last drop and then making out in front of me
5224852 well i moved on to the next town i saw marie from time to time each of them and both of them crazy times i think i lost myself for a while
5224853 after a while could you tell them apart by technique
5224854 i thought this was a fiction blog whats with the interviews and short essays on torture instruments
5224855 obviously we are all disappointed with this result because our pace in practice was good everything went very well this morning and we felt we could push out in front
5224856 its a hard one to explain and we will look at the data but sometimes this kind of crash happens at this level of racing and it was my mistake we knew that we needed to win this race and more in order to close down valentinos advantage so this makes the championship very difficult for us anything can happen in racing but fifty points is a big gap against such a strong and consistent competitor anyway i never throw in the towel nor does anybody at ducati and we will keep fighting until the end misano is a home race for the factory and there will be lots of ducatisti there so my main thought now is to stay positive and bounce back with a good show for them in two weeks time
5224857 of course i cant count this as a complete victory because casey fell and i am sorry for him but this is racing and i have to be happy with this result
5224858 i am very happy by my performance since germany we have improved a lot also thanks to the new technical material received by ducati i also thought i could have done a podium in laguna seca but i committed a mistake and i couldnt make it today everything went in the right direction i am sure that we can maintain the same level for the rest of the season i heard rumors that wanted me in superbike next season i never spoke to anybody in superbike and i want to remain in motogp for many more years i am happy to work in the alice team and with the pramac racing structure if things will go well in this final part of the season i dont see why i should change team
5224859 i want to say what a fantastic day this is for me today after the injury in barcelona i have not had the opportunity to go quick due to my condition but all the people around me including the whole team and suzuki stayed really close to me and gave me great support so i am really happy to pay them back with this podium it actually feels more like a win for me because it means so much after the break following laguna i was able to get some rest and start training again to get myself back in the best condition and although i am still not 100 i am nearly there and i was able to challenge all weekend my dream this weekend was to fight for a podium after friday i felt i could do that and today i started with a good focus to do my best this result is for all the team and everybody working with me because when we make a great result i am really happy and today i am certainly really happy
5224860 we took another step forward with the new bike today although i have to say that it has not been easy to get this result we came to brno without any test data but the team did a great job with the set up i want to thank honda and team gresini for giving me the chance to ride this bike which represents a great opportunity for me to improve on the results weve managed so far im just disappointed that i lost positions at the start because i made contact with another rider but at the same time satisfied to have recovered and finished the race in fourth a result i can be pleased with
5224861 to finish fifth is a really great feeling and it just shows exactly what we are capable of achieving i got a good start to the race but i dropped down to sixth after a few laps and i was worried that i wouldnt be able to fight back especially after not having much dry time on the bike here however my confidence grew as we went on and i was able to catch up with john and pass him for fourth at the halfway point the grip levels dropped off towards the end so there was nothing i could do about shinya other than to continue lapping consistently to the flag i felt so much more comfortable on the bike than i have done previously and the bridgestone tyres definitely had an advantage over some of the other riders i had to ride really hard today in fact i didnt even look at my pit board until halfway through so theres still more work to be done as we had to push a lot to get out of the turns fast enough thankfully it paid off and fifth place is my best result yet in motogp so im really happy
5224862 i got a good start and was scrapping with the kawasakis which seemed like they were surprisingly fast today and got held up by them a bit i managed to get past ant west and then started to catch john hopkins but i started to have some issues with front grip and had to change the way i was riding the bike once i got past john it felt like i had nothing left and the situation was getting worse which was awful as the race was only about seven laps old i kept my head down and worked out the best way to ride and how to try to preserve the tyre at one stage i thought about coming in but i worked it out and managed to get home in sixth place to get some points id like to congratulate loris on his podium today it was good to see him come back like that after his injury and im very happy for him
5224863 the first ten laps were really difficult because i got a bad start and i didnt have a good feeling i couldnt push the bike on the way in or the way out of the corners because the bike wasnt hooking up and it felt nervous gradually as the fuel load lightened and the tyres got up to temperature the grip improved and became more precise i managed to improve my pace lap by lap and caught the group ahead of me then made some passes its a shame i lost more than ten seconds over the opening laps because we could have had a really good result today
5224864 even i finished the race as the best of the rc212v satellite riders todays result isnt too satisfying because we were expecting to finish in the top six we werent too far off that target but this wasnt the race wed imagined unfortunately after the first lap when i lost several positions i made several passes but lost the position to other riders who were faster down the straights tomorrow well make the most of the test here at brno to continue to improve ahead of the san marino grand prix which is of special importance to me
5224865 it was a difficult race and the result is clearly not where we want to be i dont want to be fighting at the back of the top 15 and neither does my team or yamaha and it is disappointing all i can do is go out there with whatever i have got underneath me and give it my maximum and i did that but this team and yamaha deserve to be higher up and today wasnt good enough it would be easy to let my head drop but i have never been that type of rider and i am not going to start now i was reasonably happy with my start but i had a few moments with the front tyre on the first couple of laps and i soon realised that i was at my maximum and that i wasnt going to be able to do much more it is disappointing because i have slipped out of the top ten in the standings and that was one of my big goals before the start of the season we have got to keep working hard as a team and hope that michelin can quickly turn it around for the rest of the season so we can try and get back into that top ten and keep the morale up of the team colin had even more problems than me so it must have been tough for him but this is the situation we are in we will all keep pushing hard and see what we can do

5225038 i was a bit nervous before as we had not won a game but this is a great feeling
5225039 reaching the semi finals was our first goal and now that we have made it we await the crucial matches with a lot of confidence
5225040 we may have scored only one goal today but we played well there is a lot of passion going into the semi finals we want to repeat what we did four years ago
5225041 it will be a big ask for us they have a home crowd they are a very fit side they have a fast midfield are well disciplined and have a couple of the best strikers around
5225042 we will give it a good shot this is how we thought it would happen playing against china in the last game to decide our fate

5225060 so did you do any cloud computing over the weekend
5225061 the application was to protect the use of the term cloud computing as it relates specifically to our offering
5225062 at the time when we announced our solution it was not quite as pervasive a term we sought to protect our intellectual property and we certainly respect the intellectual property of other people and would not infringe on that of others

5225067 now lets run through what weve played so far this week once more before lunch
5225068 like sorta rugged kinda purple metallish with the twang of a dry gator jaw
5225069 it was true that there should be no special treatment for anyone as this is a team camp but there was really no need talking too loud about it the players are also human beings
5225070 we have met and resolved all differences everyone has put the misunderstanding behind them and theyre really looking forward to saturdays match
5225071 we thank god that the wind of crisis has evaporated everyone said his mind and were all united again and ready for battle everything is working well for us ahead of the game
5225072 i have spoken to some officials and they have seen reason and there is really no longer any pressure i hope to be here till the end
5225073 that the club was apprehensive that as i was not playing enough and wanted me back but after i played the full game against the usa and they realised that nigeria was serious in holding me back they backed down
5225074 this is so far the banks largest deal with a microfinance institution in the country it is also the largest portfolio financing support that lapo has received from a commercial bank in its 21 years of existence
5225075 after 48 years it is safe to say that the nigerian experiment is working
5225076 48 years after independence nigeria has emerged from being a mere outpost of the british empire to her dominant position today as the giant of africa and a leading member of the international community
5225077 nigeria is not just a long tale of failures of course it could have done better in the immensity of the challenges facing our dear country what i see is a brilliant future of opportunities to give our people a better country

5225082 i can confidently say he can score goals in the spl and the championship because weve played hibs and sheffield wednesday now well see if he can score goals in the premier league
5225083 hes scored goals for every team hes played for and that includes his country he just wants to score goals and we think that weve unearthed one
5225084 if you can unearth a striker its like swimming the channel theres a lot of expectation on him and im sure hell do okay
5225085 we expect to see the proposal for 2009 by the time we resume we have asked the president to submit the proposal by september 9 2008 we dont intend to step out from the precedent we have laid everything will be subjected to thorough scrutiny we want to begin work on the proposal so that we can have a budget by christmas
5225086 we will like to advise that the government adopt another strategy and just forget about the ribadu thing if it is still interested in this business of fighting corruption
5225087 we expected it to decline we are turning away some work
5225088 prices are down in the insuring of big ships and big properties if you dont have a fair chance of making money whats the point theres a time to compete and a time to say its yours baby
5225089 we have spent the last five years building up our regional business tv adverts and the internet are driving sales up 52pc on last year
5225090 the internet is driving the way we buy as consumers we believe we have to go to where people buy but we will also be available through brokers
5225091 people who use their brains to do what they are doing they are our target market
5225092 there were a few tropical storms out in the pacific when i last checked but it is all about whether they hit land

5225098 i dont know where shes from the republic of cocktailland
5225099 are you aware that innocent villagers in the creeks are now being held hostage by oil bunkerers who threaten that they would deal with them if they expose their bunkering activities to security agents so tell me what are they are turning their agitation into if they terrorize their own people and make life difficult for them who are they fighting for
5225100 the iyc has always criticized the excessive use of force by the jtf as far as finding solution to the crisis in the niger delta is concerned
5225101 usually these communities are under siege by militants and they leave in share helplessness while the security agents watch and the jtf rather than improve on its internal security and find the armed groups attack these innocent villagers
5225102 the first thing they do as their own means of over powering such insurgence is to burn down the nearest peaceful community in a reprisal attack kill children and women this is not an acceptable method of war the jtf should respect the rules of engagement the geneva convention and the nigerian constitution when dealing with the civilian population
5225103 agge today is suffering a double jeopardy from militants and military alike in as much as peace is the goal we desire the road to peace is peace
5225104 we however condemn any group within the region that has refused to respect the ceasefire initiative of the councils high command as ijaw youths all we seek is justice equal rights and resource control in a true federalist state of nigeria
5225105 mr president must truly consider a fast means of tackling the niger delta before it tears us apart the ijaws can no longer continue to leave like a conquered people within our great country nigeria
5225106 if truly these people have the love of their people in their minds as they are proclaiming they should have stopped all these things knowing the harm it is causing to their people
5225107 he is waiting to show example with any soldier that will be caught aiding or abetting oil bunkering
5225108 they are making quick money building houses riding flashy cars and acquiring property all over the cities from the illicit money men of the jtf lobby to be posted to the parts of the region where oil bunkering is going on because of the returns and anybody that stood in the way of the syndicate is usually marked for elimination
5225109 to my chagrin it kept going on though at a lower rate this time around
5225110 even when other areas get cleaner this particular place remains continually polluted and that attracted my attention
5225111 they use metal drums they call it cooking and they keep boiling the crude oil from there they are able to separate kerosene diesel and petrol
5225112 what they do is that they put let us say a drum of crude on fire and they keep boiling it the way you cook your normal food at a stage due to the heat it has been subjected to the products will separate themselves there is a pipe through which water is removed as they cook the crude
5225113 is responsible for the bad fuel you get at times from some filling stations and roadside petrol hawkers which damage the engine of vehicles
5225114 the dealers patronize them because their product is quite cheap and they can make 10 times the money they would have made if the product was lifted from the nnpc depot
5225115 nobody will open his eyes and buy petrol that is bad because it will affect his business dont mind them it is just rumour
5225116 little or no attention is being paid to the long term fall in oxygen concentrations and its knock on effects
5225117 the o 2 concentration of the atmosphere has been measured off and on for about 100 years now and the concentration at 20 95 has not varied within the accuracy of the measurements only in recent years have more precise measurement techniques been developed and the tiny decrease in o 2 with increasing co 2 has been actually measured but i believe the o 2 concentration is still close to 20 95 there is so much o 2 in the atmosphere it is believed not to be substantially affected by vegetation but it is the result of geochemistry in deep ocean sediments no one really knows for sure since too much o 2 is not good for humans the human body keeps o 2 concentrations down to around 5 in our major organs extra o 2 can give you a burst of energy but it will harm you or kill you if the exposure is too long it has been estimated that global wildfire risk would increase greatly if o 2 concentrations were much more than they are now to say that there is an impending oxygen crisis on earth is the epitome of fear mongering
5225118 this is the sort of story i would expect in the supermarket tabloids next to a picture of bat boy for the uk guardian to say there is a oxygen crisis is not only ignorant of the facts but simple fear mongering riding on the coat tails of the co 2 crisis i really wish the media would do a better job of researching and reporting science stories this example from the guardian shows how bad science and bad reporting combine to create fear mongering
5225119 it may be useful to mention that the oxygen is only 1 5 of the atmosphere and the atmosphere is just 1 1 200 000 of the mass of the earth however the earth is very heavy 6 x 10 24 kg so the mass of the oxygen in the atmosphere is something like 10 18 kilograms about 150 000 tons per capita we could not burn that much oxygen even if everyone in the world were using a private jet on a daily basis
5225120 there is a simpler way to see that man made changes to the oxygen levels are trivial and we will look at it now
5225121 virtually all other compounds participating in the relevant chemical reactions are either liquids or solids which is why they dont influence the composition of the atmosphere and we can ignore them when you realize what the words above mean you will see that the man made decrease of o
5225122 so the carbon dioxide went from 0 028 to 0 038 the difference is 0 01 or one ten thousandth of the volume of the atmosphere because o
5225123 as we have already mentioned two oxygen molecules are replaced in typical
5225124 at any rate you see that the oxygen level couldnt have decreased by more than 0
5225125 does the tiny decrease of oxygen levels change some important things
5225126 at any rate all these changes are negligible given the tiny change in o
5225127 tatchell writes i am not a scientist but this seems a reasonable concern
5225128 we cant change the oxygen level in any significant way
5225129 men have been able to change the overall carbon dioxide concentrations measurably because it is a trace gas there was almost none to start with so it is easy to change its volume by relatively large amounts proportionally speaking
5225130 is there someone at the guardian who has some common sense left could you please stop printing insane people like peter tatchell who help to transform your daily into an expensive and dirty piece of toilet paper
5225131 an oft heard warning with regard to our planets future is that by cutting back tropical forests we put our supply of oxygen gas at risk many good reasons exist for placing deforestation near the top of our list of environmental sins but fortunately the fate of the earths o

5225136 even in a tough economy corporate america isnt shutting down and companies across the globe are even more focused on securing high impact cost effective marketing programs we believe the 5w style pr is the real key to any successful awareness campaign
5225137 were stoked to work with such a creative results driven team
5225138 msrs proven track record in the health and fitness industry and understanding of our business made them a natural choice to help take us to the next level

5225140 were confident msrs specialized senior level talent will help promote the benefits of surf specific core training and make surf stronger a household name
5225141 were thrilled to be working with rihanna and island def jam records for this unique live event
5225142 we know rihannas fans will jump at the opportunity to communicate with her and were delighted to be able to offer this experience for our customers
5225143 the coming talent shortage may force employers to overcome their age bias and introduce new opportunities with which to utilize this powerful asset
5225144 to be more precise the upcoming working retirees want to work on their own terms
5225145 there was nothing wrong with her brain she was always aware of who was visiting her
5225146 she would communicate with her eyes and we would try to read her lips
5225147 she bought a motor cycle lately and i was so concerned that she would end up in an accident i would worry about all sorts of things happening to her not knowing that her death would have come like this
5225148 what hurts so much is that my daughter was so healthy and active she wasnt even sick
5225149 she was my friend wanted me to go out with her everywhere if i dont agree she would get her friend to persuade me i gon miss my daughter
5225150 we were surprised to find how pervasive this really is particularly because few factors negatively impact morale and productivity more than the perception that others are not held accountable for results

5225221 where we get concerned is when the government starts pushing into an area that is already being serviced by private groups businesses churches and private enterprise are providing the service already

5225242 upward pressure on inflation is likely to continue throughout the year largely due to rising food prices and elevated oil prices the indian government recently raised retail fuel prices by around 10 per cent and we expect there is more to come
5225243 we believe wpi inflation will remain in double digit territory until may 2009 we expect wpi inflation of 17 per cent by september 2008
5225244 but with real rates still very low further action is needed in order to curb price pressures
5225245 after several years of strong growth of close to 9 per cent this year the rate would moderate to around 8 per cent level and stay near there in 2009

5225265 we know its going to be extremely hard with two of our main targets not being in there
5225266 its disappointing but all that means is other guys have to step up its not something im concerned about just yet when we get up and going we have too many weapons for that to continue
5225267 it hasnt been consistent enough not to any one of our liking
5225268 weve got a lot of talented players on the line and right now theyre playing a little switch around game and nobody really knows what theyre doing whatever five is out there has to get the work in in practice no 1 and get a little cohesion
5225269 a lot of teams have looked at cleveland and looked the other way were usually the team that other teams have their highlights on but no more
5225270 ive seen a highlight reel of braylon ed wards catching the ball and me running for touchdowns were not the team to look over anymore cleveland is in the house put us on prime time and lets see what we can do
5225271 we havent been on monday night for the five years since ive been here its a big stage for us to play on and its good to see where we are against the world champions especially the starters and first teamers
5225272 they have a really good offense with eli a big back in brandon jacobs 6 4 264 and good receivers
5225273 youre supposed to use preseason games to knock the cobwebs out last game we could have done better with our angles to the ball we cant be looking in the backfield while guys are running past us
5225274 i got my arm on it and then the next thing i knew i was on the ground it popped out when i hit the ground and when it popped back in i went to the sidelines
5225275 id be worried if we were playing baltimore on sunday but weve still got some time its not worry time yet
5225276 we have two more preseason games left and a little while before the opener im not saying i dont want these guys back with us tuesday practicing but thats not reality
5225277 well see how it feels in the next couple of days well see if i can go full speed
5225278 its a progressive thing i can run at 80 percent last week it was 60 percent
5225279 we have enough time on task going on six years with these guys
5225280 i think i have a real good read of their body language when theyre coming in and out of their routes weve been doing it in games for six years throwing back in california in training camp and otas weve got plenty of experience with each other we just need to get them in shape and get them on the field at 100 percent
5225281 weve got some guys injured but the good thing is that it allows more play for jerome
5225282 i thought glenn holt played well marcus maxwell started over there in t j s spot and did a nice job so weve got some guys making some strides that way
5225283 but hes definitely got a long way to go before he can come into a game and you can count on him hes playing in a new league and thats a big step up from him considering where hes coming from coastal carolina he just needs more reps in game like situations
5225284 dont think about the last play because the most important play is the next one
5225285 i looked at the ref and said how can you say i wasnt on the line
5225286 but i forgot about it because it was now the most important play
5225287 i was more nervous in green bay than i was here the big change going from x to z is theres a lot of lingo as far as the playbook thats a big adjustment understanding all the calls and motions

5225382 meu resultado foi regular n o era o que eu buscava para o primeiro tiro foi s para classificar mesmo fiz uma boa largada s que flutuei muito em cima da barreira errando na primeira provavelmente erra se nas 10
5225383 antes de chegar em pequim vinha obtendo marcas melhores que as de hoje domingo se repetir d para chegar na final

5225387 aquele jogo foi um roubo foi um esc ndalo o que fez a arbitragem mas n s n o merecemos a classifica o especialmente por como perdemos contra os americanos pela estrutura do v lei da venezuela e tudo mais n s n o merec amos e quando a gente n o merece a bola cai sempre do nosso lado
5225388 n o vou ocultar que tivemos problemas com o treinador ele teve problemas com v rios atletas mas vamos conversar mais tarde para saber o que vai acontecer
5225389 a diferen a cultural grande demais o que os atletas querem n o a mesma coisa que a gente quer e o choque cultural foi importante
5225390 na nossa mente o objetivo era a classifica o para as quartas de final ent o n o estamos contentes mas demonstramos que estamos a um bom n vel e pode haver muito o que fazer e do que falar com esse time
5225391 primeiro t nhamos que respeitar a classifica o se o resultado se revertesse a gente poderia mudar a ordem de classifica o e tirar aqueles que fizeram por onde
5225392 e segundo porque eu queria rodar no ltimo jogo o murilo jogou bastante no lugar do dante ent o eu queria que o dante rodasse o giba est precisando de ritmo est precisando rodar queria p r o samuel um pouco mais o rodrig o tamb m jogou est o todos aptos e prontos est o bem testados para mudan as nas quartas de final e semifinal agora dar continuidade e ganhar consist ncia
5225393 jogamos contra um time que saca muito forte bloqueia pesado era interessante testar o time nessa condi o ent o foi muito v lido ainda falhamos em alguma coisa no ataque a gente precisa rever isso mas o time chega mais equilibrado entrosado confiante e isso importante essa uma competi o longa se chegarmos com essa reta de crescimento acho que est num bom caminho

5225396 i am a levite of bethlehem in judah and i am going to live wherever i can find a place
5225397 stay with me and be to me a father and a priest and i will give you ten pieces of silver a year a set of clothes and your living
5225398 now i know that the lord will prosper me because the levite has become my priest
5225399 our ancestors had the tent of testimony in the wilderness as god directed when he spoke to moses ordering him to make it according to the pattern he had seen
5225400 you stiff necked people uncircumcised in heart and ears you are forever opposing the holy spirit just as your ancestors used to do which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute they killed those who foretold the coming of the righteous one and now you have become his betrayers and murderers you are the ones that received the law as ordained by angels and yet you have not kept it
5225401 i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing at the right hand of god

5225411 you are fucking disgusting i have been playing shows for 15 years and never have i seen someone do what you just did i am seriously fucking disgusted thank you and goodnight
5225412 it was an extremely good night we were very pleased with the attendance which was around 300 everyone enjoyed the food and had an excellent time
5225413 operation falcon has a relentless nature and has continued to produce some excellent results in terms of catching drug dealers and bringing them to justice
5225414 the vast majority of the offenders we have caught have been given prison sentences or are currently on remand awaiting sentencing
5225415 that means we have taken a lot of drug dealers off the streets
5225416 operation falcon is dedicated to catching and convicting criminals who choose to supply drugs to the more vulnerable in our community
5225417 many of the neighbourhoods have sited drugs as being the main concern for the residents and such criminality will not be tolerated by police
5225418 we will use all available methods to continue with the success we are having at present
5225419 we continue to make it known that if we identify networks already operating or attempting to set up business in the town we will be very proactive in stopping them whether that means removing their assets locking them up or both

5225422 i am looking forward to this game we got beat at home to plymouth three seasons ago so it will be a good opportunity to put that straight
5225423 it was my first professional english game and i only started because of injuries to other players we got beat which wasnt nice but it was a great experience and i was happy with the way it went apart from losing
5225424 even if we had won that game no one could have imagined what was going to happen we didnt deserve to lose that day we played some very good stuff
5225425 but we had a game three days later against brighton and won that set us on our way
5225426 we are looking forward to playing at home after two away games in three days it will be interesting to come back in front of our own fans and see what the atmosphere is like
5225427 how full the place is how many fair weather supporters we have got all those things will be of great interest
5225428 the ones who turn their back and only want to watch us in the top division we dont want them
5225429 there is an element of deja vu and first game of the season and a similar occasion i would hope for a different result but they are a good outfit
5225430 they got a good result 2 2 on the first day against wolves so they are very capable and like all paul sturrock teams you just know they are going to be very competitive
5225431 we are very much finding our feet if we come through this game then you can have an initial assessment the way the season is going the challenge for me was the attitude of the players at the start of the season the evidence of the first two games is that the attitude is very good
5225432 this will be a different test because there is an expectation at home not that we will cruise through but that we will win no victory ends up in your lap you have to earn it and that is something we have to stress before tomorrows game
5225433 we are very much back in the routine and if you are not looking forward to it then there is something very wrong with your build up to the season
5225434 at this stage you just want to get on with it and hopefully get a positive result
5225435 you will remember that when miss fernandes finished giving her evidence she alleged that what she had said could not be relied upon
5225436 during her evidence she gave an account saying she had seen the assault and was taken through the cctv but considering that was not the truth in short she came to this court willing to lie
5225437 it comes to a time in some cases when a judge has to stop the case and this is what i have to do
5225438 as you all know last year my team told me that i needed to do a better job of coaching my direct reports i just reviewed my 360 degree feedback i have been working on becoming a better coach for the past year or so im still not doing quite as well as i want but im getting a lot better my coworkers have been helping me improve another thing that i feel good about is the fact that my scores on effectively responds to feedback are so high this year

5225483 2006 was prominent in the opening part of john edwards statement he used it three times in the first eight sentences
5225484 2006 played a key part in elizabeth edwards statement too she referred to the year four times
5225485 and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march of 2007

5225497 the last couple of months have been pretty choka doing both jobs
5225498 not giving official guidance to the public yet about the next version of windows other than that were working on it when we are ready we will provide updates
5225499 starting on august 14 2008 steven sinofsky leading the windows group jon devaan leading windows engineering and the windows engineers are co authors of a new blog that is specifically focusing on the coming wave of client technology in windows 7 it is a treasure to get direct from the horses mouth information about what is reality and what is vapor when discussing windows 7
5225500 microsoft might be trying to accomplish by maintaining a little bit more control over the communication around windows 7 some might say that this is a significant understatement we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk again top of mind for us is the responsibility we feel to make sure we are not stressing priorities churning resource allocations or causing strategic confusion among the tens of thousands of partners and customers who care deeply and have much invested in the evolution of windows
5225501 windows has all the challenges of every large scale software project picking features designing them developing them and delivering them with high quality windows has an added challenge of doing so for an extraordinarily diverse set of customers as a team and as individuals on the team we continue to be humbled by this responsibility we strongly believe that success for windows 7 includes an open and honest and two way discussion about how we balance all of these interests and deliver software on the scale of windows
5225502 related to disclosure is the idea of how we make sure not to set expectations around the release that end up disappointing you features that dont make it claims that dont stick or support we dont provide starting from the first days of developing windows 7 we have committed as a team to promise and deliver thats our goal share with you what were going to get done why were doing it and deliver it with high quality and on time
5225503 it is quite understandable that media analysts developers it pros general public and microsoft employees not in the engineering team are genuinely curious and interested to learn whats coming in the upcoming next version of windows
5225504 if you ask me i would not expect e7 to be the place where announcements about new features and release schedule are made what i believe this is going to be is a sharing opportunity to discuss the complexity and challenges behind a large and complex project like the creation of the next version of windows is
5225505 you have a look at his results since the media descended and it shows the character doesnt it

5225544 the biggest single problem we face is with attitudes weve still got cases at both police and cps level the outcome of which is decided when they first receive the complaint based on what they think the credibility of the witness is
5225545 they dont try to improve the credibility of the witness they make a decision at the outset that this is going nowhere and then the case is on a downward spiral
5225546 people are still being dragged kicking and screaming to the plate they say theyre just being realistic but theyre second guessing outcomes around the country you still have individuals who are charged with responsibility at a senior level who are cynical at best about rape in general people are saying is it a priority for me
5225547 however much politicians want to change the attitudes to rape juries are still fairly judgmental where alcohol is concerned its certainly something that helps me as defence counsel
5225548 women drinking is still regarded as not quite right by a lot of juries if they think maybe the woman has contributed in some way by being drunk they will be reluctant to send someone to prison
5225549 defence counsel will say youd had a few you were up for it
5225550 its something that strikes a chord with a jury everybody knows there are a lot of things you might do drunk that you wouldnt do if you were sober
5225551 my advice to cops is investigate if someone gets their car nicked or their house broken into and their dvd players gone then you start an investigation irrespective of the respectability of the victim

5225564 a tunnel would have posed a significant challenge because the rock formation there is not conducive to tunnelling also the cost of the tunnel and associated works would be in the range of 200 million those factors combined together prompted the decision to not go ahead there
5225565 that slope has always been waiting to fail youd have to cut back a huge chunk of the mountain in order to remove the rock that wants to come down
5225566 what theyve done historically there is to trim it back and use rock bolts and cables and whatever means of reinforcement but you can only do so much of those because the mountain is fundamentally unstable
5225567 a tunnel is a very good solution but expensive as a minimum youd be thinking of twin tunnels the last thing youd want is a single tunnel with two lanes in it that is extremely dangerous

5225575 wir haben gezeigt dass wir ein tolles team sind ich habe richtig g nsehaut weil ich es so gro artig finde dass wir so fr h und ohne fremde hilfe ins halbfinale eingezogen sind
5225576 i think it was pretty obvious weve got a lot of work to do based on tonight in all three phases of the game
5225577 it was a good opportunity for us to go against a quality defense
5225578 i know they had some guys out but this team is a really good team and for us to come out and put a drive together to start the game was good for our confidence
5225579 i played with luke before so it was an opportunity for us to run some old plays
5225580 he and i played together in cleveland so we have a way of connecting i kind of had an idea he was going to throw it because of the way the coverage looked we just happened to make the play
5225581 we got some experience against a good team against a fast team against a playoff team

5225816 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5225817 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5225818 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5225819 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5225820 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5225821 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5225822 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5225823 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5225824 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5225825 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5225826 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5225827 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5225828 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5225829 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5225830 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5225831 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5225832 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5225833 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5225834 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5225835 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5225836 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5225837 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5225838 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5225839 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5225840 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5225841 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5225842 what is one thing you would like to ask your readers come up with a question to pose to your visitors and throw it out there on monday as were all visiting each others fun monday posts we should answer the various questions we come across or show amp tell me about a bird im easily made happy
5225843 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5225844 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5225845 this is a planning took where all things are going
5225846 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5225847 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5225848 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5225849 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5225850 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5225851 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5225852 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5225853 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5225854 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5225855 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5225856 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5225857 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5225858 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5225859 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5225860 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5225861 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5225862 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5225863 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5225864 we will be testing children as they leave the labour ward very soon
5225865 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5225866 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5225867 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5225868 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5225869 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5225870 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5225871 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5225872 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5225873 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5225874 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5225875 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5225876 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5225877 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5225878 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5225879 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5225880 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5225881 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5225882 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5225883 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5225884 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5225885 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5225886 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5225887 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5225888 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5225889 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5225890 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5225891 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5225892 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5225893 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5225894 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5225895 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5225896 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5225897 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5225898 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5225899 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5225900 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5225901 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5225902 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5225903 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5225904 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5225905 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5225906 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5225907 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5225908 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5225909 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5225910 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5225911 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5225912 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5225913 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5225914 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5225915 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5225916 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5225917 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5225918 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5225919 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5225920 there will be little impact if schools dont have the right equipment
5225921 children will only get decent food if we invest in training the workforce and making sure that every school has the facility to cook meals from scratch using fresh ingredients
5225922 it appears a cowardly attack the offender has walked straight up to the person there has been very little altercation or conversation and theres been one big king hit inspector rod kemp told reporters in brisbane
5225923 it appears that its merely been a case of someones backed in and taken a bowser ahead of someone else insp kemp said
5225924 the cash poll has indicated all along the leadership is there for the taking if mr costello wants it mr sullivan said in a statement
5225925 he has enjoyed constant support from punters betting on the liberal leadership at the next election
5225926 brendan nelson is becoming less popular with punters by the day
5225927 we png want our young people to get exposure and experience and a bit of money to improve their lives in png he said in a written statement
5225928 we will set stringent criteria for those who would be involved to take part including that their character and behaviour would be acceptable he said
5225929 we will not allow a few louts to spoil this opportunity if appointed because we want the program to be available to png he said
5225930 the scheme will be more positive than negative he said
5225931 we png want our young people to get exposure and experience and a bit of money to improve their lives in png he said in a written statement

5225953 what we have to look at is the reality on the ground and not the special pleading from vested interests
5225954 i think the correct balance is served for the public
5225955 we know what is meant to be dealt with in summary justice reforms that it should be less serious offences that it will not be domestic violence that it will not be serious assaults it will not be sexual assaults
5225956 we cant go back to the situation where we routinely had lawyers tendering pleas of not guilty and anything up to 18 months later the accused put their hands up and had a fine imposed for a relatively minor offence
5225957 this isnt just about looking after the interests of lawyers for the accused
5225958 we have to fundamentally look after the interests of our community
5225959 we have heard all sorts of rumours as to what these guidelines are famously the three stitch rule
5225960 if someone is the victim of an assault but the resulting injury does not require three stitches or more then its appropriate for a person to be issued with a fixed penalty
5225961 our suspicion is that it is in the guidelines and the real reason why these guidelines are not being disclosed is that the public would be frankly disgusted at the way in which they are treating cases of this nature
5225962 that rumour could really only be suggested by someone who did not understand the way in which these decisions are taken
5225963 you take into account the nature of the injury thats caused but in no way would you as a prosecutor take a decision based on whether its a particular number of stitches or a different number of stitches

5225971 i could remember how excited i was to get it down at the record shop
5225972 i suddenly had a burst of energy and knew i had a lot more life left in me and thats when i woke up to the sound of the first song i ever bought

5226038 the relevant agencies met on friday after receiving weather warnings as a result northern ireland water was able to deploy resources and contractors throughout the event and around the clock
5226039 willing to negotiate if the terms on offer meet his partys requirements
5226040 this executive is incompetent its time they got with doing the job that they were set up to do its a very definite and a very emphatic no
5226041 martin the police did not plant the bomb your former associates did
5226042 he wanted to come round to the house to pay his respects but i didnt want that and we met in the hotel since then we have communicated intermittently over the years and i did meet him with gerry adams and gerry kelly but that meeting was not a terribly good one
5226043 nothing came of it and i was very disappointed by the response from adams in particular on friday i decided to send a text to martin mcguinness to again ask him to give that vital assistance and urge his fellow republicans to give the information that would convict the bombers but again he wouldnt agree to that but when sinn fein does take that step it will show that they are genuinely into peace and a system of justice which should protect everybody catholic and protestant
5226044 it would be very hard not to improve any of the london airports wed staff security queues properly and passport controls which are a joke at the moment we have people being delayed one or two hours just to get back into their own country
5226045 this is the new biometric scanner but you havent told me about it
5226046 they put the protection of the killers above the attainment of justice
5226047 the very serious concerns about how the police handled this investigation from beginning to end
5226048 that is why my position is to support the calls that are made by families here for the establishment of an independent tribunal
5226049 they obviously have lost all faith and we have seen debacle after debacle in terms of the investigation of this terrible atrocity what we need to do is support the families in the demands they now make
5226050 one of the things that surprised me because i grew up in england was that people here northern ireland protestants and i only learned this fairly recently protestants would have been taught as children that they could not trust catholics i found that astonishing but when i explored it with protestant friends they all agreed that was the case
5226051 i could never understand why it mattered that i was a catholic police ombudsman it baffled me but eventually i was told this was the teaching of some churches to their people and that meant i could understand a lot of what has been said about me
5226052 ryanair planned to clamp down on screenscraping websites that he says are ripping customers off by adding
5226053 helipad peninggalan tommy suharto mulai dirapikan saat ini tinggal membersihkan rumput yang tumbuh di sekitar helipad serta memasang balon penunjuk arah angin

5226056 optimisme rapbn 2009 mesti diikuti pemanfaatan anggaran secara efisien dan efektif dengan kegiatan dan program infrastruktur yang memberikan hasil langsung terhadap kemajuan ekonomi sekaligus efek ganda bagi terciptanya kualitas kesejahteraan dan daya beli masyarakat yang lebih baik
5226057 rakyat berharap apa yang ditetapkan pemerintah merupakan target yang realistis dan bukan suatu politik daya tarik mengingat tahun 2009 akan berlangsung pesta demokrasi berupa pemilihan calon legislatif dan presiden
5226058 pemerintah harus berkerja keras melakukan sejumlah upaya guna mencapai pertumbuhan ekonomi itu
5226059 dewan pers adalah lembaga etik yang namanya etika itu sangat dekat dengan penilaian masyarakat dalam tatanan kehidupan masyarakat maka bila ingin berjalan secara baik diperlukan ketertiban untuk mengatur ini perlu ada aturan yang jelas
5226060 kita perlu membedakan mana media yang sifatnya hanya sebatas partisan dan independen
5226061 kenapa karena media partisan itu hanya memperjuangkan kepentingan golongan mereka bukan umum
5226062 media yang dikatakan independen adalah media yang muatan beritanya umum global dan mainstream nya bukan pada satu golongan saja
5226063 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be a very important part for the success of a democracy you cant only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happened is token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed
5226064 i wanted to buy a flat in bombay and it wasnt given to me because i was a muslim and i read the same about saif ali khan now i mean if javed akhtar and shabana azmi cannot get a flat in bombay because they are muslims then what are we talking about
5226065 thats why i am so distressed over what is happening in kashmir for heavens sake it should be brought to a stop and it should have been brought to a stop right when they started that nonsense
5226066 i dont think that the muslim leadership has bothered to clear the air about what islam actually is

5226078 the anti riot police form katwe was unnecessary because we were not armed their presence created confusion they even failed to protect me against the kiboko squad
5226079 the police have made it a habit to say that they have orders from above they should tell us who that above is

5226082 they were five warriors we are left with only one whom we expect to capture anytime
5226083 our intelligence findings indicates that the warriors were returning home after their planned raid in kailong was foiled so they turned their frustration on the gateway bus
5226084 they are just looking for soft targets to try to create an impact we are not going to tolerate a few non peace loving individuals we shall kill anybody who puts up armed resistance against our efforts
5226085 this liberation was one of the conditions set by the european union for the gradual resumption of dialogue with belarus
5226086 other positive steps from the belarusian authorities that could open the possibility of a significant improvement in relations
5226087 i do not advise any knee jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement with the european union that would signify that such an agreement is more important to the eu than to russia
5226088 or russia joining the world trade organisation wto our interest in this is as great as russia itself talks in the nato russian council are essential too because we need open lines of communication to tbilisi and to moscow
5226089 russia overreached used disproportionate force against a small neighbour and is now paying the price for that because russias reputation as a potential partner in international institutions diplomatic political security economic is frankly in tatters
5226090 serious consequences that a failure to quickly and fully implement the deal would have on relations between russia and the european union
5226091 if this part of the ceasefire agreement is not applied quickly and completely i will be led to convene an extraordinary european council to determine the consequences
5226092 we must also determine if russias intervention against its georgian neighbour will have been a singular brutal and excessive response or if it marks a new hardening of moscow vis a vis is neighbours and the whole international community
5226093 could become catastrophic if they herald the state of a new cold war
5226094 an international deployment to separate the sides and verify that they keep their commitments
5226095 the international community will have to mobilise to go to the aide of displaced persons or refugees and to help georgia to emerge from the destruction

5226106 the whole world was watching us and we had a chance to show the world how it could be if we ran things
5226107 but it is i who am the ritual i the sacrifice the offering to the ancestors the healing herb the transcendental chant i am the butter and the fire and the offering
5226108 i am the goal the sustainer the master the witness the abode the refuge and the most dear friend i am the creation and the annihilation the basis of everything the resting place and the eternal seed
5226109 were concerned about how thats going to be utilized by people who will be potentially disruptive
5226110 very bare bones and very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
5226111 you showed the sign where it said stun gun in use and you just change the word gun for bolt and its a meat processing plant
5226112 we want to make sure we got our game plan set
5226113 we want to make sure the entire procedure is laid out all the personnel know what they are supposed to do
5226114 our coach wishes to present russian spirit through our competition at the olympics
5226115 its the first time weve used a russian melody at the olympics and we were surprised to see that the spanish team also chose russian music
5226116 with the russians absent mengual and fuentes won the olympic qualifying tournament in april mengual also swept the solo and duet with fuentes titles at the european championships in march but the spanish synchro standout has never won an olympic medal
5226117 in all the competitions that we attended they didnt win
5226118 in europe the spanish team is very strong but overall the russian team is better
5226119 davydova and ermakova the defending olympic champions had not performed in international competition since winning at the world championships in melbourne australia last year
5226120 their movement was not synchronized the element were ok though
5226121 using music composed by elton john the american pair christina jones and andrea nott placed fifth with 47
5226122 we did different hybrids that were not required before each element and after each element
5226123 that makes it so much more difficult hopefully it pays off
5226124 our theme was anger we tried to get that across
5226125 the duet free routine preliminary round is scheduled for tuesday with the top 12 ranked pairs advancing to wednesdays final

5226138 assured that georgians would not continue to use military force
5226139 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5226140 president medvedev agreed but we cannot postpone and we cannot delay with these tasks
5226141 it is up to russia now to decide whether it will continue to defy the world or accomplish its final goal of regime change in georgia
5226142 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5226143 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5226144 save afghan lives defeating the enemies plan to discredit the afghan government
5226145 we recommend to all afghans to be vigilant at large public events and other locations where crowds gather and report suspicious behavior to security forces
5226146 all the time the enemy tries to carry out any kind of activity that it can but the afghan security forces are ready and we have already taken measures to disrupt any enemy activity
5226147 gold rebounded mainly on technical short covering it may rebound above 800 looking at the dollar and oil
5226148 gold and other metals have recovered a bit but its still early to say they will recover continuously gold and oil prices are still in a downward trend
5226149 gold and precious metals have been oversold and the pace of falls was clearly too rapid gold is gaining some support with end users also showing demand on price dips
5226150 active sell offs may slow but a rapid recovery is also not expected as there is plenty of selling interest if gold rises back to around 850
5226151 the big picture is that there are several dimensions in which games have effects
5226152 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5226153 simple solution is to return the device to the store provider from which it was purchased and demand repair or replacement
5226154 of course what really matters is the quality of the games and unfortunately too often third party games for wii are absol
5226155 to prevent potentially embarrassing protests inside tibet china has turned large parts of tibet into a virtual prison for the duration of the games
5226156 many should feel ashamed of their groundless accusations once they know what the chinese government has done for ethnic minorities
5226157 unfortunately the olympic spirit is not being respected at all by chinese officials in tibet

5226160 designing the speaker drive units from scratch allowed us to maximize the performance of every unit for every position in the car which is some cases were not ideal fortunately our mindset for designing engineering solutions to operate to extreme levels but always within known parameters is one we were used to
5226161 many hifi systems sound different and therefore something is going on which interferes with the end result of the musicians art

5226167 the hotel is surrounded by beautiful hills and its a cold morning
5226168 there are smouldering ruins and the roof is gone it was truly a magnificent building and probably the biggest thatch in southern africa
5226169 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5226170 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5226171 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5226172 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5226173 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5226174 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5226175 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5226176 garden grove contacted us because they just had a teen who was killed after leaving a house party where drinking occurred
5226177 ive had a lot of positive feedback from our own residents
5226178 we have to change the sequence and routing patterns theres quite a bit involved in programming it
5226179 we have sent out e mails and will send out another reminder before aug 23
5226180 we probably have 40 or more fax machines throughout the organization
5226181 its relatively simple to use the menu on the machine and changing seven digit numbers to 10 each department will do that for its machine we have alerted everybody to do that
5226182 years ago we were going crazy having to go out and reprogram systems every few months when the puc added an area code so we put all our systems on toll free numbers
5226183 any decent sized security company would have switched to 800 numbers by now
5226184 my only concern was descendents of the peirce family and they obviously have come out in strong support
5226185 i have not been convinced otherwise that we need a school so big you have to take away a ballfield
5226186 no one has shown me where they have land to build other fields portsmouth only has so much land
5226187 i respect peters opinion very much but he didnt make the agreement his grandfather did and i think we should keep our word
5226188 where i come from you can borrow 10 000 with a handshake and your word so i believe strongly we should keep our word
5226189 there was a 2 hour washout on saturday but we had good storm camaraderie through it all
5226190 we all gathered in the same tent and kept each others spirits high the storm blew out to sea and we finished the day
5226191 when the city puts on an event like this everyone benefits
5226192 it was inspiring to meet the workers and see the importance of what theyre doing for our country
5226193 but i cant believe the facilities have been allowed to get into such a state of disrepair
5226194 this is about making sure they have the buildings and dry docks in place and that their supplies are protected
5226195 he was a young kid and they just wanted it to be over at the court they felt he was apologetic i dont know how you live with something like that
5226196 something tragic happens and there are people who take advantage of it and dont do their jobs they are responsible for taking care of those who didnt do anything wrong that sentence was a slap in the face david was a great person and its really sad theres no accountability no responsibility today the whole situation is unfortunate for what he took away i dont think 21 days is appropriate its a tragedy
5226197 we have to look at the defendant and his background and the facts of the case we consult with family members and make what we feel is an appropriate sentence the purpose of a sentence is rehabilitation punishment and deterrence
5226198 the economy has taken its toll on this business with the fall off in construction
5226199 i said holy smokes what is this i was totally blown away it was like a lightning bolt hit me
5226200 convening a seemingly alphabet soup of people with unalike interests and discovering connections through cross talk basically saying how are we going to save this planet
5226201 i said wheres my tribe there was no one from new hampshire or maine and just a smattering from vermont
5226202 yet these were new england values they were talking about sustainable agriculture permaculture
5226203 three months later they said ok were going to gamble
5226204 no one has heard of bioneers in northern new england its a conference model that has heretofore not existed
5226205 having all those things under one tent its not easy to wrap ones brain around it
5226206 this began five years ago in the wake of abu graib and other discouraging news from iraq
5226207 the first year we didnt attempt to use the event as a fund raiser but now we do two years ago we raised 2 500 for the chaplains emergency relief fund last year we raised 4 000 and this year we should come close to doubling that
5226208 a guy gets deployed and suddenly the furnace breaks down it happens a lot and thats what the chaplains emergency relief fund is all about
5226209 any service member active duty reserves national guard if they have a new hampshire connection and they need help we try to see that they get it

5226220 actively involved in cases at the earliest stages defense counsel have successfully negotiated non punitive dispositions of cases that otherwise may have been disposed of at courts martial
5226221 a commander should use nonpunitive measures to the fullest extent to further the efficiency of the command before resorting to nonjudicial punishment
5226222 if future recruiting and retention rates dropped to a mix of the 2005 and 2006 levels

5226255 the conservative leader hopes to distract us with frisbees floral shorts and photo ops
5226256 but a serious look at his policies reveals an approach which is at best confused and at worst would be deeply damaging for our economy
5226257 cameronomics is emerging in which photo ops warm words and conflicting promises attempt to distract from a risky and destructive ideological agenda
5226258 over the next few months we in the labour party must expose the risks and contradictions at the heart of cameronomics
5226259 be it on global commodity prices the collapse of northern rock the 10p tax rate or the future of nuclear power
5226260 the greatest inconsistencies are in fiscal policy where cameron is promising lower taxes more spending and lower borrowing all at the same time
5226261 faced with calls to make the sums stack up cameron reverts to slogans sharing the proceeds of growth or living within our means when pressed he concedes this means sticking with labours spending plans
5226262 cameron knows that his party are keen for some traditional tory red meat especially on tax cuts their policy positions also reveal ideological stances which would be bad for the british economy

5226280 theyre just going under the name of the kaiser chiefs
5226281 i did drugs for 18 years and i never got that bad as to say you know what i think the kaiser chiefs are brilliant
5226282 were definitely not offended but i do actually like it i think its a bit of sport
5226283 it is funny though because it does happen every single time they put out an album and the last two albums its been us
5226284 when i was 17 and noel was going on about blur i was watching it and now im 30 and hes 50 and hes talking about us its brilliant
5226285 weve been talking about getting some kind of ufo for a while and we thought finally wed found a place which would let us do it
5226286 but apparently there were all sorts of issues with the wind and the usual rubbish you get at big gigs and festivals where they tell you you cant do anything you want to do
5226287 maybe one day well be able to put all the stuff in wed like to but i dont think itll happen in this country for some reason
5226288 i think the health and safety laws are too tight i think it would have looked quite impressive
5226289 last time was probably the most jading experience id had with the band
5226290 i drank 10 cans of lager on stage to numb the pain ive been looking forward to this for a long time
5226291 me and hugh harris were racing buggies through v festival and he lost his guitar
5226292 its not true there was this big dog and it ate my homework and then i lost the guitar
5226293 there was a hole in our tent so we nearly got electrocuted
5226294 someone threw a lighter and hit me on the head
5226295 ive never been hit by a missile in 15 years
5226296 it was a bit unsettling there was a torrent of water falling into our mixing desk which is never a good combination and then people throwing things
5226297 i was a bit shocked because usually theres a lot of love at our gigs
5226298 i didnt notice first of all we came off stage and i saw heidi bending over and i think she thought she was going to throw up i think shes feeling a little bit light headed and keisha hurt her foot
5226299 theyre all casualties in there the dressing room theyre dropping like flies but its all good theyll be alright
5226300 oftentimes academic researchers will get government grants to do things that youve got to wonder why are they doing that
5226301 theres plenty of research out there that doesnt need to be done and why somebody funds it is one of the great mysteries of life
5226302 industry funds a lot of research that often helps its bottom line that shouldnt surprise anyone
5226303 only the best athletes in the world can perform at this level playing more than one hour running and jumping on a complicated surface like the sand under strong wind heavy rain or the hottest conditions if they didnt like their uniforms the fivb would have received tons of complaints for them which is not the case
5226304 what i should be doing is celebrating some of the best days of my life and my engagement to the man of my dreams instead of having to deal with photographers taking invasive pictures from bad angles like all women out there should i love my body
5226305 to all girls with butts boobs hips and a waist put on a bikini put it on and stay strong
5226306 one of the reasons to say i love the skin im in is because you really do another reason is simply being defensive i dont want to fess up but im going to say im happy and im going to lose 18 pounds in three weeks as soon as i can im going to guess hers was the second reason
5226307 if she had to lose weight to get her energy back that means she wasnt ok with her weight back then she didnt have enough energy
5226308 i feel more comfortable with myself my sexuality my mentality and my viewpoint

5226316 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5226317 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5226318 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5226319 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5226320 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5226321 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5226322 reach out to younger people who can be moulded to lead a moral life based on islamic tenets
5226323 it was under congress rule that babri masjid was demolished it was then that puja was performed in the masjid all politicians are selfish and see minorities only as a vote bank
5226324 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5226325 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5226326 tired of thinking for yourself fed up with making your own decisions you need new religo faith our dedicated staff will tell you what to do when to do it and even how to clean up afterwards order now and well throw in a free extra commandment or prohibition especially for you religo faith because thinking is such a drag
5226327 there i was face to face eyeball to eyeball with the largest human ive ever seen and i disarmed him by
5226328 a free taste would go a long way in making the consumer case for mobile tv
5226329 mobile tv services have taken off in japan and south korea where service is offered free of charge in italy where additional fees have been the norm usage has been limited
5226330 once you start charging consumers they start getting turned off
5226331 i was just able to gain a lap at the right moment
5226332 nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year
5226333 i am playing an unbelievable season no doubt i have to be very happy for everything
5226334 the feeling for sure is very happy for being number one but the feeling doesnt change too much because the last years i did very well too
5226335 it is a satisfaction i want to enjoy these two days probably but later i have to be focused on new york
5226336 rafas rise to world number one in the atp rankings is fitting reward for his phenomenal run of results in a difficult tennis year
5226337 his unbeaten run on clay and grass underlines rafas talent and the all round player he has become it is no small feat to have ended rogers record reign as the worlds best player and now fans can look forward to both players continuing the most engrossing rivalry in world sport
5226338 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5226339 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5226340 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5226341 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5226342 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5226343 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5226344 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5226345 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5226346 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5226347 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5226348 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline

5226350 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations

5226355 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5226356 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5226357 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5226358 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5226359 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5226360 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5226361 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5226362 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5226363 it was a shock when we found out that mr maguire had died so to then find out a second young man had been killed in afghanistan just left us numb

5226366 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5226367 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5226368 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5226369 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5226370 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5226371 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5226372 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5226373 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5226374 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

5226378 rather than using more traditional data collection methods like surveys this allows researchers parents and instructors to monitor the effects of a particular education module in the real world
5226379 we have educators doing what feels good in their gut but we dont have the ongoing evaluation for best practices because there isnt any research money

5226382 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5226383 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5226384 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5226385 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5226386 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5226387 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5226388 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5226389 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5226390 who are open to doing something on the production side
5226391 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5226392 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5226393 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5226394 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5226395 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5226396 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5226397 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5226398 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5226399 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5226400 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5226401 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5226402 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5226403 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5226404 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5226405 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5226406 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5226407 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5226408 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5226409 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5226410 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5226411 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5226412 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5226413 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5226414 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5226415 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5226416 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5226417 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5226418 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5226419 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5226420 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5226421 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5226422 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5226423 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5226424 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5226425 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5226426 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5226427 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5226428 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5226429 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5226430 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5226431 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5226432 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5226433 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5226434 what took place in the summer was manipulation from agents and did not reflect his deep desire
5226435 iraq has an ancient civilization and a rich culture and enjoys great human resources it is able to resolve its problems without the help of others
5226436 over the course of history there was never any serious strife between iraqi religious sects but after the occupation of iraq conflicts were imposed on the people tension insecurity and discord are the result of the occupiers strategies
5226437 if certain powers are concerned about iraq they had better help implement the decisions of the iraqi nation
5226438 it is ridiculous that those who have 160 thousand military forces in iraq are accusing us of interference
5226439 in talks with the u s officials we did not raise any issue outside the national interests of the iraqi nation our efforts are focused on the unity and national interests of the iraqis
5226440 the u s has never achieved victory in a serious military conflict despite the propaganda u s army is not powerful because the u s politicians do not let the u s army grow in power even if they were powerful they would be unlikely to want to experience another conflict with iran
5226441 if the u s or any other power wanted to enter into a conflict with iran the iranian nations response would be very clear the best option for the americans is to maintain friendly relations with the regional countries based on mutual respect
5226442 there were many difficult challenges in that moment of inexperience we listened we faced their anger we saw they had unique insights that complement ours

5226463 ekaterina is living in a fantasy world to say she has won ronnie is ridiculous particularly as there isnt a competition
5226464 ronnie is still trying to save his marriage and jo is desperate to see him nursed back to health
5226465 for her this isnt some school ground contest with another woman ekaterina will never have what jo and ronnie have together
5226466 its about making sure the man she loves gets well again that is her priority this silly child is trying to play grown ups
5226467 it appears a cowardly attack the offender has walked straight up to the person there has been very little altercation or conversation and theres been one big king hit inspector rod kemp told reporters in brisbane

5226472 ik heb deze morgen de wedstrijd bij de vrouwen gezien en het wordt heel zwaar
5226473 er zijn er heel wat gecrasht tijdens het lopen het wordt een ware uitputtingsslag de uiteindelijke winnares heeft zich kalm gehouden tijdens het fietsen en dat gaat een beetje in tegen ons plan om net in die fietsproef aan te vallen maar aangezien we niet echt de toplopers zijn hebben we misschien geen andere keuze we zullen het moeten aanvoelen in de wedstrijd er is een lange afdaling dus is het misschien geen slecht idee om daar aan te vallen een top 16 voor mij zou prachtig zijn want ik ben nog jong en train nog niet zo lang op de korte afstand
5226474 als ik aan 100 van mijn capaciteiten zit en ik begin aan de loopproef met de anderen dan kan ik misschien 25e eindigen maar als ik kan wegrijden in het fietsen haal ik misschien top 20 top 15 of zelfs top 10 dat hangt vooral af van de groep waarmee ik wegrijd
5226475 het wordt alleszins een andere wedstrijd dan anders er starten slechts 55 triatleten en aangezien er maar maximum 3 per land mogen deelnemen zijn er een aantal toppers van grotere landen niet bij dat kan de koers helemaal opengooien en ik denk dat alles over kleine groepjes zal verdeeld zijn ik hoop met zon klein groepje te kunnen meestrijden tot het einde
5226476 ik ben 30 jaar en draai al 8 9 jaar mee in de wereldbeker het is tijd voor wat minder druk en ik wil meer thuis zijn maar ik stop nog niet met triatlon in 2009 schakel ik normaal gezien over naar de langere afstanden maar nog niet naar de ironman ik heb echter nog niet beslist wat ik ga doen tijdens de vakantie ga ik eens nadenken

5226482 before i would waste a lot of time trying to get ingredients from the market by the time i got ready to start preparing food for sale it would be so late and i ended up losing a lot of customers
5226483 with a cell phone all i have to do is call my suppliers who will deliver the ingredients within no time because of the phone i am always on time in preparing meals for customers my business has expanded to the point that i have opened a cafeteria
5226484 the main difficulties are expense for both the physical handset and also the expense in airtime but some of the burdens of expense could be done away with when women use phones in a communal form where a community can purchase one mobile phone and contribute towards its maintenance during my fieldwork i discovered that women were actually willing to contribute towards such a venture when i came across this i also realised that in a sense women were willing to pay for a service that they understood had potential to help them and was relevant to their way of life
5226485 there are various ways a mobile phone can be used in underserved and poor areas of african countries

5226490 the conservative leader hopes to distract us with frisbees floral shorts and photo ops
5226491 but a serious look at his policies reveals an approach which is at best confused and at worst would be deeply damaging for our
5226492 cameronomics is emerging in which photo ops warm words and conflicting promises attempt to distract from a risky and destructive ideological agenda
5226493 he has tried to confine policies to vague populist promises from tax cuts to more prisons to solving family breakdown without getting drawn on delivery but dig deeper and what you see is not quite what you get
5226494 promises made to different audiences dont stack up he campaigns against a new runway for heathrow in the london mayoral election whilst promising the city to do more on infrastructure
5226495 he pledges billions in tax cuts on marriage inheritance tax and stamp duty savings to pay for proposals frequently prove illusory

5226498 in two weeks the democratic party will formally nominate barack obama as its candidate for president of the united states
5226499 craig whats your feeling about the very large numbers of new voters and how they really havent been included yet in a lot of the polling posted by brianinnyc
5226500 repub family local owned small business that created jobs shared had expectation for individuals to contribute entiled to the right to work for a better america
5226501 the over 45 age group has supported the winning candidate in every election since statistics began except 1960
5226502 i feel a little guilty for saying this but thats because were smarter
5226503 i was surprised to learn that the biggest increase in participation was not among young voters the biggest increase compared to 2004 was among voters over age 45 much of that increase came in the last dozen or so contests and clinton won them by a wide margin this over 45 group seems to be obamas achilles heel
5226504 its august its early but for democrats its over over done fini at the risk of sounding like ive snapped allow me this snap judgment the democrats have just lost the presidency this week
5226505 could someone please explain to me how anyone could favor repugs in this or any election
5226506 was surprised to learn that the biggest increase in participation was not among young voters the biggest increase compared to 2004 was among voters over age 45 much of that increase came in the last dozen or so contests and clinton won them by a wide margin
5226507 i wonder if conservatives who are not among the very wealthy have been brainwashed into believing that the republicans are the party of business youll never get any argument from me that they are the party most owned by big business
5226508 why is big business so bad who owns big business do you have a 401k why such anger at success
5226509 how can a black candidate be better than a white candidate if i think whiteness is entitled to power knowledge and prestige
5226510 the breakdown can be that by virtue of sleeping in the same bed as bill some of the time during his eight years in the white house hill was entitled to run for president
5226511 on this point you are wrong bill being her husband got her foot in the door for the ny senate but if she had never been married to him and never slept in the white house you could make an argument that she would have gotten there faster on her own
5226512 that is all it is about for you isnt it identity politics not geting anything done it is more important to you for the person to have the right color of skin than it is to have the ability to deliver the goods once elected as i pointed out before you and the kkk folks have a lot in common jack
5226513 with the right skin color please list the previous presidential nominees from either party that were african american
5226514 yep jack bill having an unfavorable article killed deserves payback
5226515 this is not about african americans and who they support this is about you and your many assumptions about people that dont support obama
5226516 with that motive why would i expect there to be any real truth in the article
5226517 the reason some people are republicans rather than democrats is they have a different view of life its that simple
5226518 kevin phillips born november 30 1940 is an american writer and commentator largely on politics economics and history
5226519 when did barack obama become barack obama there is now overwhelming evidence that for a significant portion of his childhood the man we now know as barack obama had a different legal name he was barry soetoro
5226520 hillarys got a lot of good qualities and many talents but i am glad she was bested in the primaries
5226521 let us state unequivocally at the outset of this article that we have no bias against islam and nothing against islamic people
5226522 i am not nor have i ever been a muslim especially an anti american one
5226523 i just assumed the blog wasnt contentious enough for you today and you were trying to stir up trouble anything to start a fight
5226524 when did barack obama become barack obama there is now overwhelming evidence that for a significant portion of his childhood the man we now know as barack obama had a different legal name he was barry soetoro when barack barrys mom stanley ann dunham married lolo soetoro barack barry was adopted and became legally known as barry soetoro obamas hawaiian birth certificate was updated to reflect that fact sometime between 1965 and 1969
5226525 senator obama is a committed christian he has never been muslim and was not raised in that faith
5226526 emphasize obamas otherness in penns version some darker arts were mentioned including obamas extra territorial sojourns as a youth
5226527 without elaboration he said that his greatest moral failure was his first marriage
5226528 asked about his own moral failure the illinois senator cited his use of drugs and alcohol as a young man
5226529 here mr obama usually lowers his voice to a stage whisper
5226530 there is going to be a split in the republican base on foreign policy
5226531 because the bush cheney approach has been such a failure all over the world
5226532 if someone wants only an undiffering view point from others then why not just sit in front of a mirror and talk to yourself
5226533 while barack obama and his family were sunning on the beach in hawaii last week it was full speed ahead at his headquarters here
5226534 thats why i pay more attention to the registration figures than to the polls i see at this time of year
5226535 the polls will change but we know we need 200 000 new voters to be competitive in georgia and now is when we have to get them
5226536 jerome corsi author of a pitiful new slam on obama is the product of a publishing industry that feeds off extremism whats far more interesting is how somebody like corsi suddenly becomes a player in a presidential campaign start with the fact that the author isnt a conservative in the normal or respectable sense of that word hes actually a regular on the far right hate fringe of internet journalism whose day job seems to be as a correspondent for a new extreme right wing site
5226537 the citys disastrously low performing school system was almost entirely washed away in the flood many of the buildings were destroyed the school board was taken over and all the teachers were fired what is being built in its place is an educational landscape unlike any other a radical experiment in reform more than half of the citys public school students are now being educated in charter schools publicly financed but privately run and most of the rest are enrolled in schools run by an unusually decentralized and rapidly changing school district from across the country and in increasing numbers hundreds of ambitious idealistic young educators like hardrick and sanders have descended on new orleans determined to take advantage of the opportunity not just to innovate and reinvent but also to prove to the rest of the country that an entire city of children in the demographic generally considered the hardest to educate poor african american kids can achieve high levels of academic success katrina struck at a critical moment in the evolution of the contemporary education reform movement
5226538 retool it to make it work for black urban children a real civil rights issue
5226539 fix the public school system that is what has kept a semblance of equal opportunity alive in this country
5226540 some of the richest people ive known in my life are the most unhappy
5226541 if he offered up an actual viewpoint instead of these cluster bomb links from conspiracist theorists it would prove interesting
5226542 and when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret
5226543 patsi what if its not fixable as was the case with the new orleans schools i have yet to see anyone distraught that was existed is gone you can get a bureaucracy thats hidebound teachers feeling overwhelmed and schools that are old and expensive to maintain and repair
5226544 why dont you read it and we can discuss the merits later this week
5226545 imo they are not serious attack except to those who are looking for a bit of sillyness to believe
5226546 these people are not rich but they are two income families where both husband and wife are professionals
5226547 its so overwhelming to me that some feel so desperate to have everyone else agree with their point of view
5226548 all that is necessary for evil to exist is for good people to do nothing
5226549 et certificate of live birth posted by pogo author profile page august 15 2008 3 22 pm
5226550 this msm created war between the obama and clinton camps is a complete myth
5226551 if you were truly a hillary supporter you would never go hear those sites again and we wouldnt hear anything more from you about trumped up obama lies
5226552 campaigns are costly trial and error propositions mccain had his focus group research bought and paid for by hillary
5226553 rez that extended campaign kept all the msm at bay while obama improved as long as fox et al concentrated on the clintons they werent wailing on obama
5226554 it was a surprise and pleasure to see gordo with the tech help the other night but that was so atypical
5226555 seriously i hear more cheerleading for hillary as vp i am going to vomit
5226556 i would not be on the internet all day slamming her even though shes not my preference
5226557 another new york delegate speaking on condition of anonymity predicted that as much as 30 percent to 40 percent of the new york delegation would pick clinton over obama during the symbolic vote
5226558 it would have been very easy to skip over the tech question but you generously answered it i look forward to more pleasant surprises from you
5226559 marriage is a civil institution unless you choose to make it religous
5226560 to allow his words to go unchallenged is to grant them validity
5226561 it could backfire and show that her influence is waning chances are shes not going to have as many delegates vote for her on the floor as she had in the primary
5226562 quick first impressions obama spent more time trying to impress warren or to put another away not offend warren while mccain seemingly ignored warren and decided he was talking to folks watching on tv the mccain way of handling this forum is usually the winning way obama may have had more authentic moments but mccain was impressively on message
5226563 indeed many hillary diehards including at least one member of the new york delegation are reluctant to vote for clinton after switching over to obama
5226564 i do think mccain had a clear and decisive victory over obama
5226565 there have been a series of recent reports and odd statements from various sources that lead me to believe that the republicans are holding on tightly to information that will rapidly sink obama if he secures the democratic nomination and that the information will reveal that obama has been deceptive about his background and his eligibility for potus
5226566 if you must be an attack dog please do it in public
5226567 sorry jamie but enough is enough i am not in your face every day with the same sentiment its approached whine strength
5226568 obama decided that it was important to hand out a 12 page booklet to the 2 200 people who streamed through saddlebacks doors that chronicled the candidates
5226569 the obama acolytes who are hoping for some massive rubbing of her face in the dirt will be equally disappointed
5226570 i dont think you would have seen this drama in previous elections a lot of it is due to the gender factor and the youth perceived inexperience factor
5226571 but the dictating of the terms rather than turning on the soft skills not a good tactic
5226572 first im a bitter frigid old bitch now i am a racist
5226573 vadaryl has been actively working to get hillarys name placed in nomination
5226574 if you have paid any attention to anything ive written you would know that i backed the roll call simply because ive always considered it part of the elective process
5226575 im not like you i cant forgive and i cant forget
5226576 as as silly as gordo claiming that obama using a nickname he fails to mention on his legal papers is some sort of massive criminal cover up
5226577 if it wasnt close here in florida make no mistake i woudnt cast a vote for the man
5226578 vadaryl has been actively working to get hillarys name placed in nomination
5226579 well what do we got here looks like a bunch of kansas city faggots
5226580 we are still working on a response to the media hysteria triggered by barack obamas latest pamphlet of lies titled
5226581 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
5226582 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
5226583 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
5226584 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
5226585 well i did it not as bold as some others though if the boys were around id take my suit off in the water i wasnt a prude just self conscious
5226586 left behind authors dont think obama is the antichrist whew
5226587 still the bad news for mccain is that he has had to work so hard for the voters who should have been in his column long ago
5226588 veering to the right of the ideological spectrum to win those votes
5226589 cost him the support of middle of the road americans who tip the balance in november
5226590 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
5226591 another flub bush vowed navy aid to georgia too soon
5226592 the former rivals never spoke directly about the matter but advisers said mr obama encouraged mrs clinton to agree to place her name into nomination as a nod to the historic nature of her candidacy
5226593 a sea change election the obama nomination sets the stage for a sea change election one that could not only elect a democratic president and increased reform majorities in both houses of congress but also mark a clear turn from the conservative ideas that have dominated our politics for three decades
5226594 when john f kennedy was elected president he too summoned a new generation into politics while kennedys agenda was limited the energy he unleashed helped build the civilizing movements of the following decades the antiwar civil rights womens environmental and gay rights movements
5226595 i believe patsi is correct in that every little mis step by bo will be blamed on hillary
5226596 a friend of mine said that her church not only is making it available to members of church but also planned to provide books to members of the community
5226597 because of the hostility i have already experienced and the threats to my safety and career that i may incur by openly challenging senator obamas eligibility for the office of the president i respectfully request that my name be withheld from the public democratic or republican party officials or other public officials in any discussion of this issue i can be reached by you or your staff at
5226598 and you do not know that obama has not shown the colb other than on the net you only know that he has not shown it to you or johnson other than on the net
5226599 the fec has standing to challenge his eligibility and it has not considering that it is an arm of the bush administration i can see no reason that it would not have done so if it had not satisfied itself that he was indeed born in hawaii to a us citizen or was otherwise disqualified to serve
5226600 i can see no reason that it would not have done so
5226601 the photo which was verified thursday by the ap provides compelling evidence that barack obama once had the legal name barry soetoro had indonesian citizenship and was islam all of this contradicts official and unofficial information provided by barack obama
5226602 okay rez i was hoping you wanted to fly to california in november
5226603 why should we waste time pondering their future actions based on their past assurances
5226604 gordo you are naive to think that the bush administration fec would wait until after the nomination to move on that and allow the dems to build any momentum through their convention
5226605 so the new york times has obama on tape reciting the muslim call to prayer in arabic thus they know he was raised as a muslim no one learns that from childhood unless raised as a muslim
5226606 i think we can predict the future as soon as it becomes the past if we were paying attention in the present
5226607 barack obama returns to action saturday after a weeks vacation for a joint appearance with john mccain at the saddleback church in california obamas reappearance on the campaign trail signals the beginning of three of the most critical weeks of the general election in the modern era there has never been quite as concentrated a dose of potentially campaign altering events as the coming three weeks could produce
5226608 how does this pertain to hill bar its one thing if obama just blows it voters if thats the case he has no one to blame were it to be shown that she bill were trying to court voters to her favor instead then she would receive huge blame based on what ive heard if she gives an appropriate speech and votes for obamas nomination at the convention anyone still voting for her would just show themselves to be spiteful and i think shed be okay
5226609 advertisers will see you read this if you feel like a shock try finding out how many online advertising companies are tracking you every time you use the internet
5226610 what the hell you believed enough to vote for him in the primary so you might as well go for it meanwhile ill hope for the best but am buying a dont blame me i voted for hillary bumper sticker
5226611 i dont give a damn about this country and it can go to hell because my woman didnt get her way
5226612 russia and iran can have this country because the us didnt treat hrc fairly
5226613 whats keeping you from buying a bumper sticker that says
5226614 russia and iran can have this country because the us didnt treat hrc fairly
5226615 a modern comparison would be the role played by united fruit in central and south america
5226616 the company transformed from a commercial trading venture to one that virtually ruled india and other asian colonies as it acquired auxiliary governmental and military functions until by the government of india act 1858 the british crown assumed direct rule following the events of the indian rebellion of 1857 the company was finally dissolved on january 1 1874 as a result of the east india stock dividend redemption act
5226617 if you dont worship obama the terrorists win you hate america
5226618 we are fortunate and i had a pleasant visit with my mother today
5226619 hillary and bill have hijacked the denver convention this clintonian tour de force raises a key question about barack obama is he strong enough to be president or can he be pushed around his failure to stand up to the clintons makes one wonder how effective he will be against bin laden iran chavez or putin
5226620 it could backfire and show that her influence is waning chances are shes not going to have as many delegates vote for her on the floor as she had in the primary
5226621 in stark contrast to the obamedias reportage on the roll call vote deal between obama and clinton this new article from real clear politics
5226622 how does this pertain to hill bar its one thing if obama just blows it voters if thats the case he has no one to blame were it to be shown that she bill were trying to court voters to her favor instead then she would receive huge blame based on what ive heard if she gives an appropriate speech and votes for obamas nomination at the convention anyone still voting for her would just show themselves to be spiteful and i think shed be okay
5226623 in his reading of the terrorist psyche conrad persistently stresses the qualities of vanity and sloth i e the desire for maximum distinction with minimum endeavor in other words the need to make an impression is overwhelming and a negative impression is much more easily achieved than a positive in our era this translates into a thirst for fame probably no one under 30 can fully grasp it but fame has become a kind of religion the opium and now the angel dust of the mass individual
5226624 as to brian he is very smart but he is also a provocateur
5226625 it is also home to one or two or three constantly bad actors who occassionally show a good side
5226626 publishing under a nom de plume is a time honored editorial device
5226627 mom dont it is a june bug j u n e bug if it was a november bug i wouldnt hit it

5226648 one of her new songs heavily samples the theme tune
5226649 and the soundtrack and score will be a theme running throughout the record
5226650 its really interesting if a little bizarre but i suppose thats what you would expect from her at the moment
5226651 when amy was writing back to black she was surrounding herself with 1960s soul music and girl groups and that was obvious in the record
5226652 all they really need to do is file that return so they can get their money
5226653 the amount she may need to get her lights turned on
5226654 its very important that people take full advantage of this rebate

5226657 we are not here to judge if he is right or wrong we are here to have more discussion and develop our own ideas
5226658 well never try to follow the west or mao we follow our own way
5226659 champix has worked very effectively which is great news for the people of county durham and darlington we were one of the first areas in the country to start using this in december 2006 and we are having great success with it
5226660 if you look at the use of champix by specialist stopsmoking services we are averaging a quit rate in the mid 70s
5226661 we are getting a lot of word of mouth interest
5226662 it has gone very well i have met so many people from out of town
5226663 it has recovered well since friday and i think that the people who have come into town today have had a great time
5226664 there has been all kinds of things going on the event is developing its own persona
5226665 i thought it worked really well there was a big influx of people in darlington and for those not expecting to see a car show as well it was quite a nice surprise
5226666 we are like twins when he first arrived in france it was just like i knew him already
5226667 we would sit up until two or three in the morning we werent very good at speaking but we would understand just like brothers
5226668 on my first trip to darlington it was my birthday the day after i left for home as a gift they said come back any time
5226669 i speak just conversational french i can get by but he speaks really good english
5226670 i am very happy to have been asked and have been looking forward to it for a long time
5226671 i realised we wouldnt make it back to linton and faced with the prospect of ejecting i carried out the emergency drill hoping instead to glide the aircraft to a forced landing
5226672 we broke through cloud at 2 500ft and both of us looked for somewhere flat and uninhabited on which to land i spotted rufforth airfield and turned towards it i then made what may seem an unusual decision to shut down the engine
5226673 by then it was doing more harm than good and i knew that by closing it down the aircraft would act more predictably in its final descent as well as increasing the gliding range
5226674 at about 700ft in the final stages of the approach i thought we were not going to make it
5226675 the safer option would have been to eject but the aircraft would have crashed into rufforth village so we had to stay with it and i continued to fly the aircraft to the best of my ability
5226676 ft lt dunn showed great presence of mind he displayed captaincy airmanship and handling skills well above that of his probationary instructor category
5226677 someone has more or less taken a hammer to it and tried to break it all the front has been marked and chipped
5226678 i know this has been going on for the past two years but they have been taking baskets and flowers all of which can be replaced but when it comes to people breaking a headstone it is getting a bit ridiculous
5226679 i am so angry what sort of person does this when my sister rang me she was in a state she was sat at the grave and it broke her heart
5226680 the only thing i can think of is for the council to put a camera in that area
5226681 if they put one or two cameras in that area it would stop everything going on people are only doing it when there is no one around
5226682 we are very sorry to hear about this vandalism at west cemetery
5226683 there ought to be a common basis for making decisions about exceptional circumstances and i think anybody who uses the nhs for their care is entitled to expect that
5226684 what patients need to do is to find out from those who are making the decision what the basis of that decision is and if they dont think its reasonable if they dont think it compares appropriately with decisions that are taken elsewhere ask why not
5226685 they keep coming up with things to say but nothing concrete is happening it is all hot air they keep saying they are going to stop the postcode lottery but nothing has been done about it
5226686 people need the drugs when they need them not in six months time or longer by then it may be too late
5226687 there is so much going on in the town we want the various elements to complement each other
5226688 we are trying to ensure the right balance between additional housing developments opportunities to create jobs and the retail and service sector in the town centre
5226689 its also about planning a highquality environment with good links for travel not only to the rest of the region but within the different parts of town
5226690 hopefully with careful planning that will steer future development it can all fit together nicely
5226691 it was very nice of them to do all that at such short notice
5226692 the dolphin centre did really well though it wasnt the same
5226693 there was no red carpet for us and although there was music there was no dance floor it was nothing like what we had wanted we missed out on a lot of stuff
5226694 i put the calls in on friday afternoon to find extra people to work but when they heard about the circumstances they all pulled together

5226705 and it takes a lot of money too we tend to lose money but last year we lost a lot of money and if we lose badly again it probably would be the last
5226706 the festival and its survival depends heavily on the bar a lot of people last year were bringing their own drink which does not help us because we rely heavily on the bar take
5226707 we need to discourage people from bringing their own alcohol we would ask them to support us by buying drinks on site they are reasonably priced
5226708 we are having family flowers at the funeral and we want contributions and donations to the football club so that we can maybe get a trophy and have a memorial game between west rainton fc and pittington
5226709 he loved his football he played for durham county fc from the age of ten or 11 to 17 he was a centre forward and he played in defence it didnt matter where he played
5226710 he played for hallgarth manor for a couple of seasons and he was the top scorer for the season with 28 goals jamies funeral has yet to be finalised but is likely to be on friday at st cuthberts church north road durham city followed by burial at durham crematorium

5226723 the good news is obviously no state is better prepared or organized to deal with whatever comes this way than the state of florida
5226724 floridians should prepare now for the tropical storm anytime you have a storm nearing the straits or the gulf all coastal residents need to pay close attention to its progress
5226725 floridians should review their plans and follow the guidance of your local emergency management
5226726 plans to evacuate should include tens of miles if not hundreds if an evacuation order is determined
5226727 have a destination in mind before one would hit the road and make sure to register with your local emergency management office if you have special needs

5226737 a full investigation will be carried out and our sympathies are with the families of the killed and injured civilians at this time
5226738 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5226739 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time
5226740 the casualties were treated at a nearby isaf medical facility where two of them children remain seriously ill
5226741 isaf deeply regrets the tragedy of this incident when women and children were killed and injured as a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they would have known women and children were present
5226742 the enemies of afghanistan have yet again shown a complete disregard for the lives of the innocent who they claim to fight for

5226745 i think it was pretty obvious weve got a lot of work to do based on tonight in all three phases of the game
5226746 our attacking play in the first half was good but as soon as we lost ryan giggs to a hamstring injury and michael carrick with an ankle we lost a bit of our experience in midfield
5226747 we ended up having to push patrice evra out to the left side of midfield and he is obviously not our best attacking player being a left back
5226748 in the context of the season we can come from behind theres no question about that
5226749 there are 37 games left and its not a disaster we lacked real width and penetration to make a make a difference to that game and that was a real problem
5226750 they call me blockhead in the changing room so sometimes it comes in handy
5226751 its a huge result for us and for going to the champions we knew it was going to be tough well take a lot of positives
5226752 i was moved by the stories i heard first hand from the refugees
5226753 it is important to show compassion for all displaced people and refugees regardless of background
5226754 collecting information about the situation on the ground and expressing support for the humanitarian efforts which have been deployed on short notice
5226755 a wide range of issues need to be taken into consideration in order to address the future of the region and the future of the people affected by the south ossetia conflict including many historical legal geographical and political aspects and of course the will of all the people of the region
5226756 clear picture of the humanitarian situation and to help stabilize the security situation
5226757 the osce has a wealth of experience on the ground in the region as well as the infrastructure and personnel
5226758 we need to stabilize the situation work fast to get back to dialogue and help tackle the humanitarian crisis

5226764 goals change games theres no doubt about that i thought we had total control of the game and probably had three or four real opportunities richard wright had a couple of magnificent saves and we squandered a couple of real good chances
5226765 we thought with the shut out we had during the week at bury we would have been boosted by that
5226766 we worked hard during the week and youve seen that with the way theyve controlled the game we just had to get that goal we never got it and paid a heavy price
5226767 there was plenty of effort today but you cannot continue to gift goals like that because all it does is take the wind out of everybodys sails and thats what happened
5226768 we had total control of that game it just looked like a matter of time until wed score and go on to win it but we really shot ourselves in the foot
5226769 ipswich hadnt threatened in the game but thats the nature of the championship even when youre in control of games theres always a chance that youll lose a goal on the counter attack
5226770 there were two opportunities for a header but then the shot should have been blocked and of course it bounces and the worst bad luck you can get like the goal last week a terrible deflection and it flies in the corner
5226771 theres no getting away from it we controlled the second half we just needed that spark to get the goal and give us a lift but never got it
5226772 the third goal probably summed up the bad luck or whatever you want to call it
5226773 they were really soft goals not someone hitting a 20 yard or 35 yard volley against you
5226774 atherton collieries is always a difficult venue a ground which does not allow for free flowing football
5226775 i was probably cheering before it hit the back of the net
5226776 i dont think id even hit it and i was celebrating the goal
5226777 we are very happy with the three points im pleased to have scored it was about two years too late
5226778 but whoever scores scores it is the points that are important
5226779 the second half we started not as well they got a couple of chances to make it 2 1 but to strike back immediately was the key to the game
5226780 it looked for a long time it was going to end 2 2 but finally we got the winner
5226781 it was great in the dressing room he just came in and told us how we deserved it so lets carry on and get him a few more wins the best way to shut everyone up is with results
5226782 that was all right today but we can do better and we know it
5226783 it was great in the dressing room he just came in and told us how we deserved it so lets carry on and get him a few more wins the best way to shut everyone up is with results ooijer starts blackburn rovers party early

5226813 it took someone from alabama who never met a jew to come to my rescue
5226814 there are only a few people out there who do reach out
5226815 i have one daughter and shes the pride of my life
5226816 i thought to myself im not married i dont have any kids i want to do something meaningful with my life
5226817 just seeing that someone was in need i thought what would it hurt to have a blood test done
5226818 i knew that something could eventually happen to my kids one day
5226819 i did it for him just as i would want somebody to do for me and my children
5226820 i wanted him to be able to see his daughter get married and have children
5226821 never in my life had i had a surgery before
5226822 i felt kind of scared because i was afraid she was going to get hurt or something
5226823 she did the right thing because saving someones life is the best thing you could do
5226824 im extremely happy to have him alive dancing at my wedding and im looking forward to many more years with him
5226825 the transplant is a miraculous occurrence and she was the angel of mercy for me
5226826 great contribution to the development of the construction industry in moscow and many years of dedicated work
5226827 im just carrying on the work my great grandfather started
5226828 theres a light in every person that comes from god
5226829 but someone has to light the wick for that light to shine
5226830 most synagogues are engaging in outreach to try and find new and innovative ways to reach out to jews who are on the outskirts of jewish life
5226831 they chabad do have a long track record of very actively reaching out to jews who no longer even know the road back into the community
5226832 its like a family we just enjoy coming our jewish heritage has become more important to us now than it was in new york
5226833 i am one of the most assimilated people you will ever find
5226834 when i started performing and recording the songs i realized that this would be a challenge for me surely in light of the significant financial limitations
5226835 theres something special about singing to women only a sense of unity and strength surrounding the space it seems that women are looking for opportunities to bond and strengthen their common potential
5226836 the chabad website personnel approached me for an interview which did allow for added exposure to my new album and i am happy about that however i am not responsible for their advertising policy
5226837 my music is deliberately intended for secular audience as well
5226838 some people in the religious community think its too modern
5226839 chabads founder rabbi shneur zalman from lady said that music is the souls quill in many cases music can touch the soul in ways that no speaker or book can
5226840 im embarrassed that its a subsection of my own religion that is behaving toward the community of which i am a member in this very aggressive manner
5226841 their style is to ask for forgiveness rather than permission
5226842 its a heavily traveled narrow road that you cant turn around on and theyre proposing to have 50 to 100 preschoolers on it
5226843 theres a right of way for 26 years to that building
5226844 theres a city road to that building any permission that needs to be asked is from the city
5226845 they have not occupied it and dont plan to until theyve gone through the proper hearings
5226846 chabad can be rough and sometimes they come in and do what they want to do
5226847 but i dont know that theyve done that in this neighborhood
5226848 i dont know much about my judaism but i have been attending chabad classes with a very special rabbi
5226849 is a wonderful teacher and he accepts everyone into learning about our judaism he takes the ancient texts and makes them relevant to my life
5226850 the emphasis is on the children thats really our big draw
5226851 we try to make the richness of our heritage easily available and in a respectable way
5226852 its safe to say that there will never be another like rabbi groner its also safe to say that if world jewry could produce another hundred like him we would instantly solve the global problem of jewish assimilation but thats the problem with great men they are so rare that they are not always appreciated during their lifetime but are sorely missed once their fiery hearts are no longer present to illuminate our lives
5226853 people are marrying out of the faith theyre having fewer children daring to be gay living an alternative lifestyle but society is also becoming increasingly secular
5226854 when i started to research the subject i discovered there are many aspects of jewish life that are still invisible people have a lot of assumptions about jews and jewishness and what i found for myself is that people actually know very little about it
5226855 judaism is a product i look at it as a product like anything else
5226856 for somebody to buy an idea theyve got to be shown the product in its best way possible no one likes the idea of judaism being thought of as a product but sometimes you really need to look at it from a commercial point of view
5226857 formal practice of religion is on the decline but there is still an interest in spirituality and judaism within our community
5226858 what were offering is spirituality and were offering it to people who no longer just want to go to the synagogue and read the prayers they want to get some buzz out of it and spirituality that has some depth
5226859 there isnt really a jewish community centre like there used to be
5226860 because there are so many other things available its not a big attraction any more so therefore outwith the synagogue the restaurant is probably the most active focal point where people can gravitate to and socialise within the jewish community
5226861 forty years ago there were three or four kosher butchers in the area now theres none but at the same time i can go to sainsburys at 9 30pm and pick up a kosher chicken
5226862 wherever weve gone people couldnt do enough to accommodate us whether it was with kosher food or to generally make things easier for us
5226863 we dont seek non jewish people but we welcome them
5226864 if somebody comes and they want to convert there are various laws to try and persuade them not to get involved but if they are obstinate so to speak and they want to pursue being jewish of course we will welcome them
5226865 the way to get hold of people is to try and reach them at their level and then bring them to ours
5226866 theyve done everything in life theyve tried drugs theyve been around the block a few times and its not given them any more happiness suddenly they look around and say where is happiness
5226867 no spiritual leader of the australian jewish community has had a bigger effect on the postwar generation both in terms of the restoration of spiritual life and educational institutions
5226868 the all night study session is always a highlight of the year each person decides their own level of participation some will stay only for a short while and some will stay until 4 am but the cohesiveness and inspirational atmosphere affects everyone who attended
5226869 the reason for the dairy meal goes back to the circumstances that existed when the torah was first given one of the torahs commandments is the laws of kosher kosher preparation of meat and meat utensils is more involved than preparing kosher dairy for the first duration of time after receiving the torah until they had time to prepare kosher meat the jewish people ate only dairy in observance of the torahs kosher laws
5226870 a beautiful aspect of the shavuot holiday is the emphasis placed on children
5226871 when the al mighty asked what guarantee the jewish people would offer to assure the perpetuity of the torahs study and observance they responded our children will be our guarantors it is therefore a time honored custom to bring even infants to share in the special reading of the ten commandments
5226872 the actions of the georgian leadership in south ossetia are a crime and foremost they are a crime against their own people because a deadly blow has been delivered to the territorial integrity of georgia which brings massive damage to its national identity
5226873 i just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in georgia
5226874 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone this of course will not change anything
5226875 we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance
5226876 ara no hi ha cap possibilitat de fer lo perqu cap llei ho empara
5226877 es dif cil no pensar en ello cuando estas pensando en no pensar en ello
5226878 certainly in the long term we intend to come here because im an australian and its an australian project but at this stage our support came from us investors and that would be very hard to get in australia and we will continue that route
5226879 rabbi groner did more to develop the orthodox community than any other rabbi he put chabad on the map in australia
5226880 history will record that rabbi yitzchok groner was beyond a doubt the greatest australian jewish leader of the past century
5226881 my objective is to make my boys and girls a mensch i want that they should be decent moral learned observant young men and women a credit to the community where they will live
5226882 this is a lot of to do about nothing quite frankly
5226883 i guess theyll be looking for an alternative site in the interim
5226884 the city is not accepting dedicated roads these days because of a shortage of funds in some areas
5226885 were going to offer to pay for it so were going through that process designing plans chabad is in the process of doing all that
5226886 the board last year said no extensions under any circumstances and they should adhere to what they said before
5226887 were not in the private rental business were in the public park area how about five more months nobody believes they can do what they need to get done in five months theyre not going to leave in january
5226888 and frankly in january im just going to say it theres not a highway patrolman born who will come in and evict the chabad kids holding a torah in one hand and holding onto rabbi cunins frock coat with the other its never going to happen
5226889 its unfortunate our requests were very minimal we will live with their decision and we will immediately be identifying any other locations as necessary because we anticipate there may be delays in our cup process
5226890 it would have been heartwarming to feel a sensitive partnership
5226891 the item on the agenda put into motion in the discussion and ultimately voted on which was to grant chabad an appeal in effect overturned joes denial of the lease extension but it did not convey a new lease
5226892 what it did was set into motion a new process through which a new lease could be potentially be granted
5226893 in the end out of fairness and listening to all sides and trying to be as absolutely objective as possible i felt that we should have moved to the next step which is grant the appeal then we should consider the remainder of the agenda and whether or not we should take those steps that would move toward a new lease
5226894 im just going to say it theres not a highway patrolman born who will come in and evict the chabad kids holding a torah in one hand and holding onto rabbi cunins frock coat with the other its never going to happen
5226895 the vote upheld the unequivocal denial by conservancy executive director joe edmiston on june 12 to extend chabads lease
5226896 and while chabad supporters stressed that the school is using less than half an acre in a 140 acre park the conservancys edmiston said that the park is predominately covered by chaparral while chabads site which includes three trailers and a fenced in field occupies one of only two flat grassy spots in the park that can accommodate large groups of children its a zero sum situation if you have trailers there youre not going to be able to have kids playing there he said amy lethbridge in charge of education for the conservancy told the group that more experiential programs have been planned for the coming year including additional contracts with los angeles unified school district to bring out more kids i need space to serve the very programs the park was purchased to serve she said
5226897 in this writers opinion what we saw was a naked political power play by a largely latino non mainstream coalition that was economical with the truth to achieve their objectives and cynically used little children in pursuit of those objectives the experience provided a valuable lesson on the political tactics of the left

5226905 id like to congratulate colin on his goal and the other members of the assembly team for their super victory
5226906 we didnt have to wait as long as the last time to beat england
5226907 colins goal reminded us all of somebody else who scored the winner against england at windsor park a couple of years ago he hit the bar as well he did well
5226908 the new salary and conditions for salaried doctors working in public hospitals would be a major attraction for interstate doctors
5226909 the government will soon start a new recruitment drive to lure doctors working interstate to the sa public hospital system
5226910 the new package will really help with recruitment and importantly will help us to keep the really hard working doctors currently in our public hospitals
5226911 it is laughable the drawn out industrial dispute will send a clear signal to health professionals interstate
5226912 while i welcome the resolution of the dispute it does nothing to actually bring new people here it sends the message that south australia is not a place to do business as a public health provider
5226913 ultimately help us greatly in recruitment and retention of doctors in the south australian system
5226914 in the context of the forthcoming review announced by mr murphy this is an interim but necessary update based upon current statistical information
5226915 nonetheless there are a number of statements and proposals in the five year review which should be welcomed in the north west
5226916 the status of the regional development strategy is reaffirmed as the overarching regional strategy for northern ireland up to 2025
5226917 the transport pivot and regional gateway for the north western corner of ireland
5226918 as the key strategic employment location of the north west and central focus of the north west development corridor extending into donegal
5226919 this framework will set out where the north west sits in the context of the strategic guidance of the rds and the national spatial strategy
5226920 it will deal with joint analysis and actions by agencies in areas such as trade investment and promotion tourism skills training further and higher education innovation and business development the chamber welcomes the updated information provided in this review and will be pressing for the speediest possible progress in the assemblys endorsement of the non statutory integrated framework for the two north west gateways
5226921 its a great pity that the meeting has run into this situation for the ulster grand prix is not only a great road race but the only road race
5226922 i always look forward to coming here and i regard it as better than the tt i thought i had a big chance but now everything has gone up in smoke or shall we say a dampener has been put on the proceedings
5226923 i am sitting here in cookstown where we are based and im wearing shorts what a change in conditions the sunshine is very strong and quite delightful if only we could have had this weather on saturday
5226924 we were preparing our bikes for the ulster and i was really looking forward to riding and getting my first win here
5226925 i had qualified highly after the practice session as had bruce anstey who is my team mate we both fancied our chances given a decent break from the weather but look what happened
5226926 now i have no reason really to stay here but im going to ride at cadwell park next weekend in the british superbike championships and after that i will head home to melbourne stopping at hong kong on the way
5226927 normally wet conditions would have pleased me but this was completely out of the ordinary
5226928 i think the organisers were quite correct in calling a halt and its a pity they werent able to get even one race into the scenario
5226929 in my seven years as clerk of the course we have had two deaths that is a bigger priority than being disappointed over bad weather
5226930 homosexual behaviour has been observed in close to 1 500 species ranging from primates to gut worms and well documented in 500 of them
5226931 sinn fein have a lot of cheek using other internationally recognised designs changing them a little and passing them off as their own
5226932 i think his constituents would be happier if he spent his time doing something useful rather than obsessing about whats on the sinn fein website
5226933 ill tell you honestly what came into my head and it wasnt to do with my own difficulties or those my family had having to move out of our house at one stage and all the security work around the house and it wasnt all the day today hassles that you had
5226934 she couldnt forgive one person and that was martin mcguinness right wrong or indifferent in her mind that was the face that was the face
5226935 how am i going to say to this girl that this is who i have met today in the role i have and when i went home that evening thats who i went round to see
5226936 i take people and maybe this is just my nature as being people i deal with people as being human beings not as a b and c as paramilitaries
5226937 i deal with people as being human beings and part of myself i suppose is if this helps and moves it the process on i will treat people with respect irrespective of what i think or may know about their background
5226938 we clearly had a great suspicion of each other of motives of what was possible of all of that but remember we were the believers we always said talk
5226939 when you enter politics when you enter negotiations you have to remove yourself certainly from the fighting mode but certainly that doesnt mean to say that all of a sudden youre compromising on everything
5226940 youre in a battle to try and get equality to try and get a proper police service
5226941 it the downing street meeting was cordial became i suppose you could describe it almost friendly it was very good mannered it was all of that i didnt think they were ogres
5226942 i knew from their point of view they thought they were doing a job i thought they were doing it wrong but thats beside the point
5226943 a lot of it i thought was political but once you start talking then personalities actually do come into it so im not being dismissive of personalities clearly if you have somebody who cannot bend and is the person who is negotiating then youre in trouble so their personalities do come into it it was certainly cordial quite friendly there were one or two humorous moments
5226944 matrics provides a platform for members to engage with others in the profession locally and around the world and to access information advice and support that are vital to professional development matrics also supports members through their professional qualifications and into full rics membership
5226945 chartered surveyors operate in all aspects of property construction and associated environmental issues and are centrally involved in all stages of the property lifecycle in northern ireland
5226946 therefore the role of rics in promoting best practice in the profession regulating its members forwarding chartered surveying as a career choice and representing the public interest in matters relating to land property and construction is of the utmost importance
5226947 i dont blame the referee as i said to him on the sidelines make a decision to play the game and allow the players to prepare mentally for a game as theyre entitled to do
5226948 if by that time the pitch is not playable because of health and safety and you have to call it off then no one will fault you for it
5226949 the players safety is the main thing and i think the referee made the right decision
5226950 i feel for the fans but my main concern has to be my team preparing my team and getting them mentally ready for the game
5226951 there are other knock on aspects and i understand that but i think the right decision was made
5226952 the league seems to be doomed before it even starts but we have to stay positive we have to stay focused
5226953 at this stage well take any fixture to get started if the rain stops
5226954 im not saying how much we lost but after last years race which was also curtailed you can have some idea of the situation we are in
5226955 get the latest buzz on the n gage platform in an exclusive interview with miikka skaffari head of developer product management learn about this latest mobile technology with host arnold farber as he inquires about the new tools apis and the sdks offered to developers through the n gage platform
5226956 they dont look at whos more religious whos less religious they look at everyone with dignity and respect theres a warmth there
5226957 we wanted to have a place where jews of all walks of life would feel comfortable
5226958 we hope and pray that the russian government will respect it
5226959 the court of appeals decision clears the way for the russian government to correct a historic wrong that its predecessors have committed against the jewish community we can only hope that the current russian authorities will now fulfill the assurances that were made to chabad representatives and to united states officials after the soviet state was replaced with the russian federation it should not be necessary to engage in extended litigation for the chabad community headquartered today in the united states to recover what rightfully belongs to it
5226960 this is a historic victory for the rebbe and for all people of faith and
5226961 that are growing rebuilding reinventing themselves unifying their disparate parts and exploring jewish traditions in unconventional ways
5226962 that hed never seen a hasidic jew of color i think he was probably making some assumptions there
5226963 whether i win or lose the impeachment the nation will lose
5226964 they dont realize they can succeed against me but the country will undergo irreparable damage
5226965 some pilots have had to take time off because the lasers injured their eyesight
5226966 why do i need a laser pointer with a range of 14 miles that can melt a garbage bag look if you have to ask youll never understand me baby
5226967 personally we would have liked to have seen 6 000 cops thats a number that we know that we can take on anything that is thrown at us but well see how it goes
5226968 i think chief harrington has underestimated the ability of anarchists to cause mayhem
5226969 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
5226970 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
5226971 i am amazed appalled and highly offended by it global warming it is a scam
5226972 would you mind if in addition to book shopping i took some photographs for a school project
5226973 its getting a little bit too close for comfort to be fair in terms of the championship but at the same time we have two race meetings left and jonathan was always going to be quick here its his home circuit and he works here too
5226974 out of all of the circuits we visit this is possibly the one i lack most knowledge of so to finish second in both races isnt too bad at all
5226975 i would have liked to have been able to fight for the wins but it wasnt to be the main thing is that we did the best we could and still lead the championship
5226976 the team did a fantastic job with the car they worked wonders this weekend but we just didnt quite have the pace in the races we were still in touch in the second one though so that was better
5226977 we had a win and a second place at brands hatch during the opening round and i like silverstone a lot i think it will suit us there
5226978 things do look positive for us for the final two events where well hopefully be back on the top step of the podium
5226979 it was nothing but politics these older rabbis in london
5226980 for years chabad was the outsider now you are becoming the establishment and that demands a different type of responsibility
5226981 in a place where there are no men stand up and become one
5226982 we have to realize that it isnt just antivirals that we need
5226983 we need to make sure that were prepared to treat people with antibiotics
5226984 certainly the idea that resident bacteria flora already present could play a role in developing pneumonia is relatively reasonable
5226985 if the 1918 flu had any impact that compromised immune function it could render a normal resident bacteria pathological
5226986 oh hell no the commies never back leftist candidates rofl baaaa baaaa bleat jackasses
5226987 maybe me and nuggsy nosworthy could have done better with the goal
5226988 he managed to turn and get a shot away and from our point of view we could have got the block in earlier
5226989 sometimes youve just got to give credit where its due and he struck it so sweetly there was not a lot anyone could do
5226990 we had one or two half chances but didnt really create anything clear cut we managed to limit liverpool to one or two half chances but they buried theirs
5226991 we could have gone in in front at half time because we played some good stuff its probably the best weve played in a long time at the stadium of light
5226992 but things changed after half time when alonso came on and started spraying the ball around
5226993 i am looking forward to that a wow signing very much
5226994 that would be nice for starters dennis wise tony jimenez and derek llambias are all working really well together to get quality players in
5226995 too often in the last few years newcastle have got players in who have not been quite good enough theyve not settled and not understood what it is to play for newcastle united
5226996 i cant wait to ring him and ask when i get home it is a shame he told the corporate members first before letting me and terry mcdermott know but that is ok
5226997 from the minute he came to the club the boys accepted him straightaway he has been a man not a boy about the place and so has coloccini he only had one training session with the group
5226998 i was at my soccer circus in glasgow last year and when it was 0 0 at half time i thought excellent
5226999 from the minute we came here i didnt expect us to do anything apart from what we did we gave a really good account of ourselves we got a performance from everyone you show them that video in the week and how hard they worked and say do it again
5227000 i dont think it has been that difficult a summer
5227001 the fans will judge everything with their own eyes we had 11 players committed to the cause here and that says a lot
5227002 they have seen three new players who have come to play for newcastle in the right manner we have a point where people didnt think we would now we have got to build on it against bolton because our home record was not what it should be for newcastle
5227003 newcastle played well but shay given made some good saves
5227004 we didnt have as much balance in the second half when ryan giggs went off and we struggled to break them down we had one or two scraps but little else
5227005 people keep asking me about the value of players and i say hes worth every penny because hes won the game for liverpool today and that could make a difference for them
5227006 thats why you would love a player like that you have to convert your chances whether you are on top or not
5227007 we looked comfortable in terms of possession but possession doesnt win you games
5227008 you know they will have a strong last ten to 15 minutes but we didnt do enough we dropped off trust me i did mention that in my team talks if you drop off torres and steven gerrard youll be in big big trouble
5227009 maybe weve lacked a little bit of match sharpness against high class opposition
5227010 thats said with no disrespect to ajax but maybe we could have done with a couple more games before playing liverpool im not here to make excuses though
5227011 deano has been an outstanding player for me for the last two years
5227012 he took the decision on the chin like you would hope and expect
5227013 when i was a player at man united i was left out for a lot of games
5227014 ask any manager i know this from being a player and what you want is to make the team youre playing feel like theyve been in a game
5227015 todays result wont have a massive effect on who we are trying to buy but the progress weve made in the two years is slowly doing that
5227016 we wouldnt have been able to sign that type of player last summer i know because i tried

5227033 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5227034 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5227035 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5227036 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5227043 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5227044 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5227045 georgia is a sovereign state and the territorial integrity of the state must be provided for

5227050 then i went into the kitchen and took some chocolate caramels and went to bed with black boy and the chocolate caramels

5227075 search engine marketing is one of the most critical acquisition channels for many companies but it is clear that a significant portion of these investments are being wasted or underutilized
5227076 as search marketing becomes even more competitive marketers would be smart to investigate automated methods for increasing sem returns
5227077 the results weve seen with webtrends customers are particularly impressive when you realize that most of these clients were already sophisticated advertisers spending tens of thousands of dollars per month
5227078 in essence we are bringing similar technology to search engine advertising that the search engines themselves use in their sophisticated programs trying to bid manually or using old fashioned bid management tools is like bringing a knife to a gun fight you might get away with it for a while but its not optimal or even advisable

5227109 ik heb deze morgen de wedstrijd bij de vrouwen gezien en het wordt heel zwaar
5227110 er zijn er heel wat gecrasht tijdens het lopen het wordt een ware uitputtingsslag de uiteindelijke winnares heeft zich kalm gehouden tijdens het fietsen en dat gaat een beetje in tegen ons plan om net in die fietsproef aan te vallen maar aangezien we niet echt de toplopers zijn hebben we misschien geen andere keuze we zullen het moeten aanvoelen in de wedstrijd er is een lange afdaling dus is het misschien geen slecht idee om daar aan te vallen een top 16 voor mij zou prachtig zijn want ik ben nog jong en train nog niet zo lang op de korte afstand
5227111 als ik aan 100 van mijn capaciteiten zit en ik begin aan de loopproef met de anderen dan kan ik misschien 25e eindigen maar als ik kan wegrijden in het fietsen haal ik misschien top 20 top 15 of zelfs top 10 dat hangt vooral af van de groep waarmee ik wegrijd
5227112 het wordt alleszins een andere wedstrijd dan anders er starten slechts 55 triatleten en aangezien er maar maximum 3 per land mogen deelnemen zijn er een aantal toppers van grotere landen niet bij dat kan de koers helemaal opengooien en ik denk dat alles over kleine groepjes zal verdeeld zijn ik hoop met zon klein groepje te kunnen meestrijden tot het einde
5227113 ik ben 30 jaar en draai al 8 9 jaar mee in de wereldbeker het is tijd voor wat minder druk en ik wil meer thuis zijn maar ik stop nog niet met triatlon in 2009 schakel ik normaal gezien over naar de langere afstanden maar nog niet naar de ironman ik heb echter nog niet beslist wat ik ga doen tijdens de vakantie ga ik eens nadenken
5227114 peaches heeft problemen zoals iedereen in ons gezin wat met ons mama is gebeurd heeft diepe wonden geslagen ik ben in therapie geweest en ook peaches heeft een moeilijke tijd achter de rug om die reden is ze aan de drugs geraakt en is ze getrouwd in ons gezin is iedereen depressief
5227115 in dezelfde kleren waarmee ze de avond voordien was aangekomen
5227116 er is weinig nieuws en geen nieuws is goed nieuws
5227117 de voorbereiding is vlekkeloos verlopen en we zijn er klaar voor we doen geen uitspraken over hoogtes of plaatsen omdat we daar met de beste wil van de wereld niet kunnen op antwoorden er kunnen 1001 dingen gebeuren kijk maar naar wat liu xiang deze morgen overkwam
5227118 wim heeft me fysiek en mentaal goed afgezet voor de competitie ik moet nu gewoon nog aanlopen en springen in vergelijking met 2006 toen ze europees kampioen werd ben ik beter in snelheid en in explosieve kracht dus hopelijk kan ik dat ook goed omzetten in mijn techniek mijn eerste focus ligt nu op de kwalificaties de kwalificatiehoogte is 1m96 en met mijn huidige vorm zou dat geen problemen mogen geven waar ik kan eindigen is moeilijk te voorspellen het niveau ligt alleszins heel hoog
5227119 maar allez mannen ik moet de kwalificaties nog springen en jullie zijn al bezig over de braban onne en medailles het is natuurlijk jammer dat een aantal belgische medaillekandidaten het niet gehaald hebben maar daarom voel ik geen extra druk ik probeer me gewoon te focussen op mijn eigen wedstrijd en wil zo goed mogelijk presteren
5227120 there is a sadness which grows from the seeds of remembered happiness there is a weariness which springs unrequested from the remembered fountains of youth there is a nostalgia conjoured from faraway places and gone people and moments which have long since ticked into the infinite fog
5227121 il grande monarca assister il papa nella riforma di tutta la terra molti principi e nazioni che stanno vivendo nellerrore e nellempiet si convertiranno e una mirabile pace regner fra gli uomini per molti anni perch lira di dio sar stata placata con il loro pentimento la penitenza e le buone opere ci sar una legge comune una sola fede un battesimo una religione tutte le nazioni riconosceranno la santa sede di roma e tributeranno il giusto omaggio al papa ma dopo un tempo considerevole il fervore si raffredder abbonder liniquit e la corruzione morale diventer peggiore che mai ed essa porter sul genere umano lultima e peggiore persecuzione dellanticristo e la fine del mondo
5227122 la pace ritorner nel mondo quando il fiore bianco il grande monarca n d r prender nuovamente possesso del trono di francia durante questo periodo di pace alla gente sar vietato portare armi e il ferro sar usato solo per costruire utensili per lagricoltura e attrezzi durante questo periodo anche la terra sar molto produttiva e molti ebrei pagani ed eretici entreranno nella chiesa
5227123 in quel tempo lo spirito del signore si effonder con abbondanza sui popoli con la rugiada della sua grazia la scienza la saggezza e la santit cosicch tutti saranno trasformati in uomini nuovi i santi angeli verranno a riunirsi familiarmente a loro
5227124 la pace e labbondanza ritorneranno nel mondo tutta la terra godr di pace e prosperit e nuove citt verranno edificate in molti luoghi
5227125 il sesto periodo inizier con il potente monarca e il pontefice santo
5227126 dio onnipotente operer un meraviglioso cambiamento qualcosa di apparentemente impossibile secondo la ragione umana le persecuzioni cesseranno e la giustizia regner
5227127 le cose devono giungere al colmo e quando la mano delluomo non potr pi fare nulla e che tutto sembrer perduto allora iddio vi porr la sua e tutto si compir in un baleno e tale sar la dolcezza che ognuno prover nel cuore che gli sembrer di gustare delizie del paradiso
5227128 dopo questo spaventoso caos rinascer lordine si far giustizia a tutti e tale sar il trionfo della chiesa che non ne avr mai avuto uno di simile
5227129 beati coloro che si troveranno in quei tempi felici perch si vivr in vera carit fraterna
5227130 rallegrati o figlia oggetto delle mie compiacenze non pi disperso sar il cristianesimo n roma priva sar di possedere il tesoro della cattedra dellinfallibile verit di chiesa santa io riformer il mio popolo e la mia chiesa mander zelanti sacerdoti a predicare la mia fede former un nuovo apostolato mander il mio divino spirito a rinnovare la terra riformer gli ordini religiosi per mezzo di nuovi riformatori santi e dotti e tutti possederanno lo spirito del mio diletto figlio ignazio di loyola dar un nuovo pastore alla mia chiesa dotto e santo ripieno del mio spirito con il suo santo zelo riformer il gregge di ges cristo
5227131 mi diede a conoscere molte altre cose concernenti questa riforma vari sovrani che sosterranno la santa chiesa cattolica e saranno veri cattolici depositando i loro scettri e corone ai piedi del santo padre vicario di ges cristo vari regni lasceranno i loro errori e torneranno nel seno della cattolica fede intere popolazioni si convertiranno e riconosceranno per vera religione la fede di ges cristo questa grande opera non si far senza un grande sconvolgimento di tutto il mondo di tutte le popolazioni ancora di tutto il clero secolare e regolare di tutte le corporazioni religiose delluno e dellaltro sesso dovendo tutte essere riformate secondo lo spirito del signore ed i dettami delle primitive regole dei loro santi fondatori ed istitutori
5227132 un santo solleva le braccia al cielo placa lira di dio egli ascende al trono di pietro nello stesso tempo il grande monarca ascende al trono dei suoi avi tutto tranquillo ora gli altari vengono riedificati la religione torna a vivere di nuovo ci che vedo ora cos meraviglioso che non riesco a esprimerlo tutte queste cose si compiranno una volta che i malvagi saranno riusciti a diffondere un gran numero di libri cattivi
5227133 la pace verr ristabilita nel mondo ma io non la vedr e altre cose si compiranno di cui io non vedr la conclusione quando sar stata ristabilita la pace nel mondo molte cose saranno cambiate la fabbricazione degli aeroplani lo sfruttamento delle miniere la produzione metallurgica tutto questo diminuir non ci saranno pi queste grandi fabbriche dove la moralit soffre e muore i lavoratori saranno costretti a ritornare alla terra il lavoro della terra ricever una grande impulso lindustria sar ridotta a proporzioni minori e rimarr tale ma i vecchi lavoratori insisteranno nel voler morire nelle citt quando sar stata ristabilita la pace nel mondo sar necessario ri evangelizzarlo e questo sar il lavoro di unintera generazione ci saranno molte difficolt si ritorner alla condizione dei primi cristiani ma allora ci saranno pochi uomini sulla terra e ci sar un altro grandioso rifiorire degli ordini e delle congregazioni
5227134 finalmente il mio cuore immacolato trionfer il santo padre mi consacrer la russia che si convertir e sar concesso al mondo un periodo di pace
5227135 verr il giorno in cui le nazioni strette attorno a cristo si sentiranno sorelle
5227136 ci sono tre diluvi tutti e tre sono tristi mandati per distruggere il peccato il primo diluvio quello delleterno padre stato un diluvio dacqua il secondo quello del figlio stato un diluvio di sangue il terzo quello dello spirito santo sar un diluvio di fuoco ma sar triste come gli altri perch trover molta resistenza e grande quantit di legno verde difficile a bruciare due sono passati ma il terzo rimane e come i due primi sono stati predetti molto tempo prima che avvenissero cos lultimo di cui solo dio conosce presentemente il tempo
5227137 il regno speciale di dio padre durato fino al diluvio e si concluso con un diluvio dacqua il regno di ges cristo terminato con un diluvio di sangue ma il tuo regno spirito del padre e del figlio continua tuttora e finir con un diluvio di fuoco damore e di giustizia
5227138 la conoscenza di ges cristo e la venuta del suo regno nel mondo non saranno che la conseguenza necessaria della conoscenza della santa vergine e della venuta del regno di maria che lo ha messo al mondo la prima volta e che lo far risplendere la seconda
5227139 io ho dato al mondo il salvatore e tu devi parlare al mondo della sua grande misericordia e preparare il mondo alla sua seconda venuta egli verr non come salvatore misericordioso ma come giudice giusto oh quel giorno sar tremendo e stato stabilito il giorno della giustizia il giorno dellira di dio davanti al quale tremano gli angeli parla alle anime di questa grande misericordia fino a quando dura il tempo della piet se tu ora taci in quel giorno tremendo dovrai rispondere di un gran numero di anime non aver paura di nulla sii fedele fino alla fine io ti accompagno con la mia tenerezza
5227140 durante lultima persecuzione della santa romana chiesa sieder pietro romano che pascer il suo gregge tra mille tribolazioni quando queste saranno terminate la citt dei sette colli sar distrutta e il giudice temibile giudicher il suo popolo
5227141 verso la fine del mondo lanticristo rovescer il papa e usurper la sua sede
5227142 uno dei musulmani rimasti si convertir diventer prete vescovo e poi cardinale e quando verr eletto il nuovo papa subito prima dellanticristo questo cardinale uccider il papa prima che sia incoronato a causa della gelosia perch lui stesso desidera essere papa allora quando gli altri cardinali eleggeranno il papa successivo questo cardinale si proclamer anti papa e i due terzi dei cristiani lo seguiranno
5227143 nellultimo periodo i cristiani non sapranno apprezzare la grande grazia di dio che avr mandato il grande monarca un lungo periodo di pace e una meravigliosa fecondit della terra essi saranno molto ingrati condurranno una vita di peccato orgoglio vanit impudicizia frivolezza odio avarizia ingordigia e molti altri vizi tanto che i peccati degli uomini davanti a dio avranno un fetore peggiore di quello di una pestilenza molti uomini dubiteranno che la fede cattolica sia la vera ed unica che d la salvezza e penseranno che forse i giudei hanno ragione nellattendere ancora il messia molti saranno i falsi insegnamenti e altrettanta la confusione che ne risulter dio nella sua giustizia in conseguenza di ci dar a lucifero e a tutti i suoi demoni il potere di venire sulla terra e di tentare le empie creature
5227144 una mirabile pace regner fra gli uomini per molti anni durante lera di pace n d r ma dopo un tempo considerevole il fervore si raffredder abbonder liniquit e la corruzione morale diventer peggiore che mai ed essa porter sul genere umano lultima e peggiore persecuzione dellanticristo e la fine del mondo
5227145 gli ultimi tempi saranno pi cattivi e corrotti agli occhi di dio i figli di dio saranno perseguitati con mezzi estremamente odiosi agli occhi di dio il trono dellultimo impero cattolico romano croller e lo scettro cadr dalla mano tremante di colui che siede sul trono a quel tempo il grande monarca sar probabilmente molto vecchio n d r da quel momento cesser ogni giustizia o sar calpestata
5227146 dopo la nascita dellanticristo gli eretici predicheranno le loro false dottrine indisturbati col risultato che i cristiani avranno dubbi sulla loro santa fede cattolica verso la fine del mondo lumanit sar purificata per mezzo delle sofferenze ci sar vero soprattutto per il clero che sar derubato di tutte le sue propriet
5227147 nel periodo in cui lanticristo nascer ci saranno molte guerre e il giusto ordine sar distrutto sulla terra leresia dilagher e gli eretici predicheranno i loro errori apertamente e senza ritegno persino fra i cristiani ci saranno dubbi e scetticismo a proposito delle credenze del cattolicesimo
5227148 nei giorni di pace che dovranno venire dopo la desolazione delle rivoluzioni e delle guerre prima della fine del mondo i cristiani diventeranno talmente disinteressati alla loro religione che rifiuteranno di ricevere il sacramento della cresima dicendo che un sacramento inutile e quando verr il falso profeta il precursore dellanticristo tutti quelli che non saranno cresimati apostateranno mentre quelli che saranno cresimati rimarranno saldi nella loro fede e solo in pochi rinnegheranno cristo
5227149 prima che venga lanticristo le porte della fede verranno aperte a un gran numero di pagani un segno chiaro che lanticristo sta per arrivare ci sar quando i cristiani ameranno gli errori e quando le persone ingiuste calpesteranno la spiritualit e la giustizia
5227150 nel tempo in cui lanticristo avr circa ventanni di et la maggior parte del mondo avr perso la fede
5227151 dopo la nascita dellanticristo la gente del mondo sar molto malvagia e irreligiosa le persone di autentica virt saranno molto scarse da molte parti i pastori trascureranno il servizio di dio e vivranno con donne persino i religiosi desidereranno le cose del mondo le chiese saranno tristi e vuote come baracche deserte al tempo in cui lanticristo avr circa ventanni di et tutto il mondo sar senza fede gli individui saranno oppressi dai governanti e da altre autorit
5227152 un giorno il signore mi disse pochi anni prima della venuta del mio nemico satana far sorgere falsi profeti che annunceranno che lanticristo il vero messia e cercheranno di distruggere tutte le nostre credenze cristiane io far profetare i bambini e i vecchi pi ci avvicineremo al regno dellanticristo pi le tenebre di satana si diffonderanno sulla terra e pi i suoi satelliti aumenteranno i loro sforzi per far cadere i fedeli nelle loro reti
5227153 dopo il periodo di pace che conceder al mondo per mezzo del mio cuore accadr che molti si allontaneranno da dio si vergogneranno di lui
5227154 enoch ed elia saranno istruiti da dio nella maniera pi segreta in paradiso
5227155 dopo avere trascorso una giovinezza licenziosa in mezzo a uomini molto perversi e in un deserto dove ella sar stata condotta da un demonio travestito da angelo di luce la madre del figlio della perdizione lo concepir e lo dar alla luce senza conoscerne il padre
5227156 il figlio della perdizione verr quando il giorno volge a termine e il sole tramonta cio quando arriver la fine dei tempi e il mondo perder la sua stabilit
5227157 lumanit non si sar mai trovata ad affrontare un tale pericolo perch il trionfo dellanticristo sar quello del demone che avr preso possesso della sua personalit perch stato detto che venti secoli dopo lincarnazione del verbo la bestia si incarner a sua volta e minaccer la terra con tanti mali quante sono le grazie portate dallincarnazione verso lanno 2000 lanticristo verr reso manifesto il suo esercito superer in numero qualsiasi cosa si possa immaginare fra le sue schiere ci saranno cristiani e ci saranno maomettani e soldati pagani fra i difensori dellagnello
5227158 lanticristo verr come messia da una terra fra due mari in oriente
5227159 there has been no material change in the current trading and outlook of the company since the company released its trading statement

5227164 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5227165 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program have been a subject of iaea discussions and are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5227166 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the united states from attacking its nuclear sites
5227167 it is clear that for years iran has had shihab 3 ballistic missiles which put israel within its reach but the threat posed by iran comes from its nuclear programme and not from its satellites or ballistic missiles
5227168 tropical storm fay poses some risks to the oil and gas production in the gulf
5227169 i dont want to talk about any other sports but he fahey should spread his vision to some other sports and comment on them as well
5227170 their statistics from doping cases are no different from the ucis statistics
5227171 and he indicated to me that wada wanted to work closely with the uci in the fight against doping
5227172 but i completely agree with the president of the international weightlifting fedeation when he said it is not mr faheys right to decide who is or is not on the olympic programme
5227173 it is the olympic committees job to do that and up to now we have always had very strong support from the ioc and in particular ioc president jacques rogge
5227174 he has stated several times that it is not the uci who is doping it is individual riders and why should the uci or the sport of cycling be thrown out of the olympic games when individual riders resort to doping
5227175 you cannot then turn around and say a sport has no place at the olympics because of a doping problem in the sport which the uci is dealing with more than any other international federation
5227176 the biological passport was never a means of instantly solving the anti doping problem
5227177 however its going to be a very useful addition to the anti doping armoury
5227178 weve carried out many tests of many of the riders at the top level

5227192 regardless of the differences of opinion it is unacceptable that those involved in whaling get injured or have their lives put in danger
5227193 instead of the stray finds of the past we are now seeing a picture of the roman road the cemetery and the civilian settlement probably of shops workshops inns brothels and temples which served the 600 soldiers in the fort
5227194 there was also probably a market at the west gate where the road entered the fort
5227195 instead of the speculation of the past for the first time we are now starting to understand the geography of roman newcastle
5227196 where there were previously questions we are now getting answers we are putting flesh on the bones of what was a significant settlement in newcastle
5227197 the cost alone of inserting it into the earth would have been high we had a huge machine to take it out but and the romans would have had to have used a retinue of people

5227204 in the absence of the provision for automatic generation of reports a large number of staff was required to analyse data and prepare reports which took two three days such delayed information was far from useful as it was not available on a real time basis for taking corrective action
5227205 the cag stated in 2003 the bmtc decided to scrap the off line system resulting in the wastage of rs 79 50 lakh
5227206 the gps tracking facility was reported to have inherent limitations like a loss of connectivity due to selective availability of satellite constellation buses not being in the direct and unobstructed line of sight with the satellite as large parts of the travel paths had dense tree covers flyovers and bridges between a cluster of high rise buildings or while buses were parked under a shelter
5227207 tracking data had not been continuos on many occasions and there were many gaps in the trip data
5227208 this report cuts through the anecdotal evidence of stock leaving the most vulnerable parts of scotland and clearly highlights for the first time that in some areas up to 60 percent of sheep have left the hill
5227209 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
5227210 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research
5227211 basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
5227212 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
5227213 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
5227214 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
5227215 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening
5227216 the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the nest day when least expected
5227217 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day
5227218 this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistimines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion
5227219 antihistimines dont deal with those symptoms on the next day

5227237 russia should prevent any further militia attacks and allow humanitarian aid to reach the hundreds of vulnerable civilians still in the area including many elderly
5227238 there are about 60 people mostly elderly remaining in the village we are hiding in the gardens and in the forest our relatives learned that three houses in our village were looted and burned by ossetians and we are scared that they will come for us as well many of us want to leave but we are scared to do so we are afraid that if we try to leave ossetians will kidnap us

5227257 in my opinion the need to pass a safe haven bill outweighed the need for perfect language
5227258 the risk to babies lives far outweighed the possibility of a few inconvenient circumstances with older children

5227260 we love and value the lives of our babies we will do what it takes to keep them safe and healthy
5227261 the evidence is they have not and are not solving the problem they went out to solve

5227272 the one year vaccination frequency recommendations for rabies found on many vaccine labels is based only on historical precedent not on scientific data
5227273 of particular note has been the association of auto immune hemolytic anemia with vaccination of dogs and vaccine associated cancers in cats
5227274 the reason i had to write this book is the veterinarian choosing collegiality over fixing their vaccination protocols the legislation drafts are already written making companion animals living property rather than a couch which they are by law and also would be a deterrent to over vaccination through loss of companionship damages it all boils down to this over vaccination has caused physical and fiscal harm knowingly due to their business model and the failure of veterinary ethics

5227284 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals

5227348 but as was the case throughout my career you just take the advice of the experts in the security field and thats what ca and the players association are continuing to do and the players would trust that opinion i have no doubt about that
5227349 the important issue now is for us to work with the icc we are not in the business of going to players and asking their answers prior to us making a decision
5227350 i work very closely with paul marsh the australian cricketers association chief executive and individual players from time to time but we are not deliberately interfering with the players preparation at the moment until we have got something to tell them
5227351 our view is quite simply we need now to see where the icc choose to go with this im sure they will come back to us in the next few days as always we are working with all of our parties and that decision will play itself out in due course
5227352 the icc are the ones who are in control of both the detail and the possible alternative venue so im sure we all understand that its their position now

5227468 were going to get this together im convinced of that were going to do it
5227469 were going to have the natural evolution of young men to men
5227470 volquez should do much the same johnny cueto is going to get better homer bailey could be here to be better and we could make a couple of off season pitching acquisitions
5227471 jay bruce talks to albert pujols and lance berkman about hitting
5227472 hes very inquisitive and berkman told him hell take control and be comfortable in a year joey votto is going to be better we have young guys like chris dickerson and hopefully we re sign jerry hairston jr and we hope he stays healthy
5227473 there are some area we want to improve and we have some veterans to help us improve
5227474 well have more stability on the bench brandon phillips is going to get better and our players will be more comfortable in the big leagues and feeling they belong
5227475 well have more speed better defense and we had a number of things that turned into distractions
5227476 we wont have nearly as many guys wondering who is going to be traded like ken griffey jr and adam dunn our bullpen should be more stable
5227477 young bill bray should be stronger next year and you have to think francisco cordero who gave up two runs in the ninth sunday will be better bronson arroyo will be better and you cant tell me that aaron harang is going to repeat this year 3 13 thats impossible harang will be harang
5227478 they played a good ballgame and just did things when they needed to a little bit better than we did
5227479 i really didnt think about the home run too much
5227480 as far as them all being doubles or better thats extremely surprising ill keep trying but i doubt its going to last long but its been fun so far
5227481 boxing is the only sport in the olympic programme without women and we believe we are ready

5227489 mit der intensiven nutzung heimischer biomasse ist salzburg ma geblich daran beteiligt dass sterreich mit einem anteil von 23 prozent erneuerbarer energie am gesamtenergieverbrauch im europ ischen spitzenfeld liegt
5227490 wir haben in sterreich immer mehr gemeinden die sich durch eine regionale vernetzung auf den weg richtung energieautarkie begeben das ist nicht nur f r den klimaschutz bahnbrechend sondern auch der effizienteste weg nachhaltig den steigenden energiepreisen zu entkommen und mehr geld im b rsel der b rgerinnen zu lassen
5227491 gerade in salzburg mit mehr als 50 prozent waldfl che birgt die forst und holzwirtschaft nicht nur ein enormes potenzial f r den klimaschutz sondern stellt auch eine entscheidende einkommensquelle dar mit entsprechenden f rderungen etwa von holzheizungen forcieren wir im lebensministerium nachhaltig positive effekte f r das klima und kurbeln auch den markt f r innovative technologien an

5227501 a lot of people havent been giving us a lot of expectations for the season
5227502 we really dont play for expectations we play for pride and were putting our foot down this year to stop the run and get after the quarterback a lot more
5227503 our schedule is one of the toughest in the league
5227504 its a big challenge for us and were going to step up to that challenge the defense is looking sharp and our defensive line is looking strong were ready to go
5227505 we had some mistakes that obviously need to be corrected
5227506 but we did some things we came in here to do
5227507 we ran the football effectively and im pretty pleased with that we worked this week on the running game and wanted it to click early on
5227508 publishes unpaid paid reviews about movies advertising amp marketing books technology music websites and what nots that might be of interest
5227509 but we had to activate him because the rules say only seven days for bereavement and that time is up
5227510 i was hoping to let him workout saturday and today and with an off day monday he would be ready tuesday but the rules say he gets only a week so he had to be on the roster
5227511 i dont know if hell be emotionally and physically ready he hasnt hit but well see
5227512 we have some young outfielders and i told him during spring training id like him to come in and observe and see what he sees an outside source
5227513 sometimes when you dont see your nephew for a year and you see him and he has grown a foot and mom and dad dont realize it because theyve been around him every day until they go buy him some new clothes
5227514 i was around this game long enough that i think i can teach most everything
5227515 we have a lot of youngsters here and he can instill some pride for now and in the future
5227516 i was a last second signing myself at the deadline so i kind of know what hes going through
5227517 i wasnt as advanced as he is i was deciding on which college to go to and i was deciding which sport to play
5227518 at the last minute i signed for pro ball after all those decisions
5227519 thats why they sent me to double a because that was the only league that was left at the time basically
5227520 we talked briefly im hoping we get it done most of thats out of my hands
5227521 i aint a lawyer dont ask me that my mom wanted me to be a lawyer thats too much school
5227522 the way our outfield is playing and jeff keppinger is playing every day
5227523 its the way i saw jerry moving at short compared to the outfield well have kepp back in there tomorrow and the next day
5227524 we dont have the power but we have more speed we have at any given time three to four center fielders in the outfield
5227525 we have more speed on the bases we can go first to third you manage more for contact were not waiting for a three run homer
5227526 they know each other on the field which is more important than the locker next to a guy
5227527 i think it probably helps them feel more comfortable being in the big leagues too
5227528 you learn from mistakes and the tough times and they say only makes you better but i have to first figure out what that is
5227529 this isnt a fun period for me because i feel im letting my team down i know what type of pitcher i am it just isnt there right now
5227530 after the first inning i felt things were going well then i dont know what happened i didnt have control of my offspeed stuff you fall behind and you have to throw strikes
5227531 he isnt used to getting hit like this he says he is feeling fine but its his location and movement the way the ball is flying out this park right now you need location and movement and he doesnt have it
5227532 its just one thing after another and i have to sit down and figure things out long pause for a long breath my arm is ok i just dont know whats going on i have to sit down and watch some video check my mechanics and make sure all is right with that something is off and i have to figure out what it is i have no clue
5227533 how many times have i had to go to the bullpen in the fourth or fifth inning it puts a definite strain on my bullpen
5227534 those guys are doing a great job but they are going to get worn out soon if they arent worn out already
5227535 no no recomendar a vuestra sociedad como un ideal para la transformaci n de la nuestra

5227540 congress is currently considering a proposal to provide 1 4 billion in equipment software and technical assistance to mexico over three years as well as a smaller but still unspecified amount to central america over the same period the first year of the initiative is part of the iraq supplemental while the second and third years will be discussed as part of the regular fy09 and fy10 appropriations process the merida initiative is actually more than an assistance package rather it is one element in a broader strategy of growing cooperation between the u s and mexico to address a shared threat presented by organized crime involved in drug trafficking the u s and mexican governments have increased joint efforts significantly in recent years in order to protect communities on both sides of the border moreover both countries recognize the need to engage central america in broader regional efforts
5227541 recent killings of senior police and army officials in mexico suggest that the government of president felipe calder n has managed to significantly hurt drug cartels and that corruption is common among police and other government bodies
5227542 a u s border patrol agent was held at gunpoint sunday night by members of the mexican military who had crossed the border into arizona but the soldiers returned to mexico without incident when backup agents responded to assist
5227543 two representatives have urged congress to take action to address the worsening situation on the southern border which has been described by reporters and activist groups as
5227544 the houston area republican told the house foreign affairs committee that members of mexicos elite counter narcotics teams trained at fort benning ga have defected and are now in the pay of drug cartels poe highlighted the fact that the guerrilla style commandos are regularly crossing the border into the u s and have been involved in violence and killings as far north as dallas
5227545 just a week ago a caravan of three vehicles were spotted on i 10 by hudspeth deputies and chased to the same area of the border
5227546 mexican officials got in touch with our mexican liaison unit to advise us that they had requested the assistance of the mexican military and that they were down in hudspeth county
5227547 on march 3 2006 a bi national action plan to combat border violence and improve public safety was signed by secretary chertoff and his counterpart in mexico
5227548 the merida initiative represents a new era of cooperation which will amplify and strengthen existing law enforcement cooperation intelligence sharing and training programs it will also provide new equipment for mexican forces to use to better confront the common threat of drug trafficking and other transnational organized crime

5227553 the m1800r was launched just over two years ago and has proved a huge success while it offered exceptional power and styling we have been missing a model designed for covering larger distances on and so its great to be able to offer the c1800rt in the uk with its relaxed riding position and additional touring kit its the perfect cruiser to cover vast distances on in comfort

5227556 theres a line drive over yonder and into the right field corner
5227557 i have a lot of hunger im a very passionate guy about baseball and im a winner
5227558 well i dont want to see them but im looking forward to seeing jay bruce and joey votto
5227559 it was very important to me to be part of a major league 40 man roster to be part of the club
5227560 the movie was very funny and relaxing but the day was very stressful
5227561 stay relaxed and dont panic theyll get something done and even if they dont youll still be playing baseball hey its an honor and a privilege to know alex and to go to his home in the winter and hit in his batting cage
5227562 ya tentu saja tuhan ingin manusia dapat terbang karena itulah dia memberi kita
5227563 entah bagian kitab suci yang mana yang mereka tafsirkan sehingga mereka malah mewajibkan tuhan harus memberi sayap kepada manusia bila ingin manusia dapat terbang
5227564 ini bukan omongan bapak lho ini tertulis dalam kitab suci
5227565 andai tuhan menginginkan x maka seharusnya y bukan z karena yang dia lakukan z maka
5227566 andai nabi menginginkan a maka yang dia lakukan adalah b bukan c
5227567 andai ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh ku jadi orang kaya
5227568 ah yang bener aja men masak gue jadi tuhan sih
5227569 all season long we focused on playing great defense and unselfish basketball
5227570 everyone made great contributions tonight and we just stuck with our game plan the page has a good team and they made us work hard for the victory
5227571 i was the best ball girl unh had ever seen
5227572 my freshman year was very humbling and probably the best thing that could have happened for my career at unh
5227573 to be recognized at such a level for doing something that i loved is just an amazing feeling and one that i really hard to put into words
5227574 i mean how cool is it to get a phone call at 35 years old to be told that what you did so many years ago mattered and the university wants to honor you for the dedication and hard work it took to be successful
5227575 its a great thing when you can make that phone call and share that moment with one of your athletes
5227576 lets hope she plays field hockey i dont know the rules for soccer
5227577 i know that if it was not for the support and encouragement from coach potitio i would not have played at the division i level
5227578 what she did for unh field hockey the level she played at she is so truly worthy of this honor
5227579 just playing at that level is an achievement but to be placed with the greatest athletes to ever attended the university of new hampshire is something i still havent 100 percent taken in
5227580 se va a poner cada vez m s y m s divertido a medida que pase la tarde
5227581 based on climate soil and temperature data i believe cabernet sauvignon to be the best red grape for my particular site
5227582 i think a lot of service providers are still operating on legacy systems
5227583 the ngn transformations are expected to be complete in europe at least by the end of 2010 2011 so in that interim and during that migration if there are solutions that will be able to improve the efficiency of existing solutions well see a demand for that
5227584 interestingly enough theres a split in the industry where companies will see a market advantage because theyve phased out toxic chemicals faster than their competitors then they support stronger guidelines
5227585 i think terms of what progress to expect in five years on the chemical side there will be no player in the global market with products that have pvc or brominated flame retardants mobile phone companies have some of the best corporate policies across the board on a lot of issues especially in terms of take back because they can afford to its not as expensive to recycle and its a benefit to them because they can recycle a lot of the materials in their phones
5227586 were probably looking at doing a little more marketing but just making the program available for people has been the biggest part
5227587 were just looking for ways to bring the total amount of product we can bring back in
5227588 we havent yet seen a deceleration of the amount of e waste going into those hidden flows
5227589 oftentimes theres open burning to get scrap metal its crazy because this stuff is filled with toxic chemicals
5227590 the current legislation in the united states is positive because it is raising awareness about cellphone recycling the wireless alliance hopes that the states will remain proactive in their efforts
5227591 unless companies eliminate all hazardous chemicals from their electronic products and take responsibility for the entire life cycle of their products this poisonous dumping will continue
5227592 electronics companies must not allow their products to end up poisoning the poor around the world
5227593 the information and communication technology sector has much to offer in creating a cleaner greener world but it must also apply international standards in reducing its own greenhouse gas emissions
5227594 it is crucial that the ict industry both acknowledges and seeks to reduce its role in climate change
5227595 communications technologies can play a vital role in reducing carbon emissions worldwide developing global standards for reducing the energy requirements of networks and equipment will help make ict an even more powerful tool for businesses to use in managing their greenhouse gas emissions and meeting their climate change targets
5227596 the epa is calling on americans to reuse and recycle old electronics
5227597 recycling cellphones helps the environment by saving energy and keeping useable and valuable materials out of landfills
5227598 maintaining a successful national consumer friendly wireless recycling program has been a longstanding priority for the wireless industry
5227599 any additional effort to raise public awareness and spotlight the important issue of wireless recycling is a good thing in my book we welcome the new campaign and look forward to working with the epa and partnering companies as we continue to spread the message about how easy it is to recycle cellphones
5227600 but in my opinion cellphones are built as a throw away product and the astronomical volumes equate to substantial energy use and disposal problems
5227601 just not a consistent standard meaning and theres a substantial push to mine that advantage
5227602 consumers who see green or enviro friendly must be alert to details
5227603 without clear standards companies are using these terms for marketing advantage its difficult to make intelligent choices
5227604 and a big part of our thrust is consumer awareness a drawerful of handsets is not the consumers top of mind issue so were looking at when and where is the best place to intervene we want the consumers attention
5227605 but there are common denominators being eco friendly is now a differentiator for certain consumer segments and carriers are asking for it
5227606 everyone wants to reduce the use of toxic materials and energy it starts in the sand
5227607 its a combination of factors you have to look at all the pieces and impact them all and you have to be a good fortune teller to predict the next problem area
5227608 our two demands are that companies should 1 clean up their products by eliminating hazardous substances and 2 take back and recycle their products responsibly once they become obsolete
5227609 the two issues are connected the use of harmful chemicals in electronic products prevents their safe recycling once the products are discarded

5227612 we hit the ball well but we left a lot of guys on base
5227613 he just made some mistakes early in the game and the guys hit him
5227614 otherwise that doesnt happen to him too often some days that happens
5227615 whenever you have a chance to get those pitchers out of the game quick its good to get to their bullpen and work their bullpen
5227616 it was a good day for everybody i guess that gave us a little more confidence
5227617 the fastballs he threw ran back over the middle they were elevated
5227618 we spent the majority of the day doing that they were pretty consistent in scoring
5227619 the way we came out swinging the bats against beckett today is a big lift for us
5227620 i think we thought today was going to be one of those games where one or two runs was going to be tough to come by to have our guys set the tone early was a big lift
5227621 the honour and dignity of the country will be affected and in my view the honour of the office of president will also be affected
5227622 it eliminates all the uncertainty in the market and i think the political uncertainty is coming to an end
5227623 the government will hopefully start concentrating on the economy from an economic point of view they have no excuses now and they have to perform
5227624 i dont want anything from anybody i have no interest i leave my future in the hands of the nation and people
5227625 and hed be like man the pizza is good today
5227626 i just wanted to make sure i took every single moment in and every single swim in every single moment with my teammates so i would remember them
5227627 to swim in the same era as him has been awesome
5227628 weve been talking about mark spitz for 36 years now
5227629 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5227630 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there
5227631 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5227632 i dont want the world to remember team usa as being failures

5227886 my dog trainer told me i should bring him for socialization purposes
5227887 these social outings help the dogs not be aggressive as for the owners it makes them feel theyre not the only crazy person who loves dogs
5227888 the other day four young men showed up with one dog
5227889 its just a nice opportunity for people to be able to sit down and relax and bring their dogs with them so they dont stay at home with their dog
5227890 people with pets generally get along very well with other people with pets
5227891 the fridays pray turning into a political show in a secular country has become neither turkey nor istanbul
5227892 iran is a neighbor of turkey with which we should have friendly relations in every sphere but the current circumstances are far from legitimizing such a visit
5227893 an empty one both in the form and in the content
5227894 diplomacy is not a zero sum game but there is no doubt that the iranian leader gained much more from this visit than turkey did
5227895 the foreign policy dossiers of turkey and the united states cannot always overlap turkey is also against irans nuclear armament there is no divergence here with washington but what differs is the method to be pursued
5227896 u s expectation from turkey to isolate iran a unilateral decision not consulted with ankara is wrong just like ahmadinejads violation of rules in turkey
5227897 i find the violation of state rules wrong turkey should have remained firm on them
5227898 but the priority should not be placed on the mausoleum visit if turkeys national interests require it to meet with the iranian leader
5227899 the u s administration may not be happy with the visit but i dont think that this will cause washington to impose sanctions on ankara
5227900 the likelihood of an earthquake in the marmara region is 60 percent we expect it to occur within the next 30 years
5227901 home prices in the us are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
5227902 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
5227903 are likely to remain substantially elevated this year and next and home prices are likely to decline further on a national basis
5227904 cities such as los angeles las vegas and miami which saw the largest price gains
5227905 the rising share of foreclosed homes in overall sales bodes negatively for home prices
5227906 the light at the end of the tunnel is a faint and distant one further the risks to this outlook weigh heavily on the downside with the main risk being the potential for financial markets to unravel further
5227907 it will be well into 2009 before the market works off all the excesses accumulated during the housing boom
5227908 three or four years ago there was a film in cannes on the great soccer player zidane
5227909 it was about one game when he was playing with real madrid what was amazing in the film was that 20 cameras were on zidane during the whole match i was amazed by it i said this is great
5227910 allowed us to bring cameras which he never ever does
5227911 he jackson allowed us to shoot in the locker room for the game at half time and after the game its just a total look at one of the worlds greatest athletes and the preparation that he does
5227912 it has really turned into this amazing documentary of one of the worlds greatest basketball players
5227913 he was the second coach out there he was directing traffic so it was an amazing piece
5227914 they are both great players but theres only one michael jordan
5227915 i was in contact with many associations and cooperatives but nobody took care of fikret mualla
5227916 once feridun lge en went to paris and he was waiting in a queue at the consulate suddenly mualla showed up drunk and started shouting obscenities others immediately took mualla to the consuls office to care for him just as mualla was leaving feridun lge en was still waiting in the queue mualla told him you will wait a long time because of your good manners
5227917 you would never see an artificial line even in his scariest face paintings every detail is well researched and disclosed
5227918 the arenas stage design has been inspired by mediterranean places of worship and fire resistant materials have been used in its decoration
5227919 since the opening of the stage july 18 more than 100 000 tourists have visited it our target is to reach 250 000 people by the end of the year the show will be staged in november in istanbul and go abroad in the new year we will perform in israel german and romania
5227920 after realizing this project we will prepare for a show on the epic of anakkale
5227921 agricultural cooperation and training program for east and west african countries
5227922 foreign trade deficit in agriculture for the first half of this year reached 1 802 billion on the basis of these data
5227923 the drought that the country suffered during 2007 cannot be depicted as the sole reason behind this situation
5227924 the international monetary fund world bank poverty alleviation policies separate the link between the subsidies and agricultural production while the increase in the value of input prices and the movements which operate to the detriment of agriculture in the internal terms of trade shrink the arable lands and hence result in the deterioration of quality and productivity in agriculture
5227925 turkey as a country which experiences a population increase of 700 000 to 800 000 per year is producing less in agriculture and paying 3 6 billion to import agricultural goods in just six months
5227926 this situation is extremely worrisome for our country particularly when we take into account the food crisis simmering around the globe
5227927 the only thing survivals should do is to be calm and quiet otherwise you may cause more deaths
5227928 the governments could do many things in istanbul in nine years but they did not
5227929 the state should give courses about earthquake and precautions against it
5227930 i think that it will not happen since we never experienced an earthquake
5227931 when i hear about earthquake on tv i think i should prepare a survival kit for one second and then i do not bother to do it
5227932 i live in merter and it is close avc lar district of istanbul where the quake in 1999 felt strongly well i believe we will survive an earthquake i guess we will not die
5227933 we forget easily so that i do not have a kit now
5227934 there should be courses to raise the awareness about the earthquakes especially targeting housewives and they should be free of charge
5227935 the picture is completely absolutely 100 percent on schedule on time there were no delays
5227936 ive seen the movie it is fabulous we would have been perfectly able to have it out in november
5227937 one hour after they drank red bull their blood systems were no longer normal they were abnormal like we would expect in a patient with cardiovascular disease
5227938 the study does not show effects which would go beyond that of drinking a cup of coffee therefore the reported results were to be expected and lie within the normal physiological range
5227939 if you have any predisposition to cardiovascular disease id think twice about drinking it

5227945 transportation of oil and oil products in the western direction by railway has been suspended
5227946 the last shipment made by this railway contained 15 tanks
5227947 we cannot be a major exporter we cannot compete with others in terms of quantity or price we must look for particular market niches for our indigenous products wine cheese and plum brandy and to sell our home grown food to tourists
5227948 the problems are small and fractured estates old and uneducated population dated technology poorly developed market infrastructure unfortunately croatia has never had a farming strategy to address those issues
5227949 they did not find it profitable to work the land and there were no punitive measures for keeping the land unused so it just lay there
5227950 americans greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5227951 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5227952 americas greatest moral failure has been throughout our existence perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest
5227953 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5227954 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5227955 do what we can to help the oppressed throughout the world
5227956 create an environment of trust and prevent any disruptive actions by the enemy
5227957 this is where i learned to love the peasant the indigenous people and to admire their efforts to excel despite adverse conditions
5227958 the hope is that my children will find work and learn a trade to meet their expenses
5227959 lugo has good intentions but i dont know if hell be able to fulfill his promises in five years
5227960 my gut instinct is that there will be a wide disparity about what rates are quoted on these sites and what they actually end up with and not necessarily due to the borrower
5227961 all the sites may not collect all the data thats necessary to give an actual price quote
5227962 one of humanitys greatest conquests has been precisely the overcoming of racism
5227963 all the government offices and services were on alert during the ceremony
5227964 the security plan required thousands of security personnel including more than 2 000 women police workers
5227965 the pilgrims were aware that these measures were for their safety and to protect them from terrorist attacks
5227966 this was the most successful ceremony since the fall of the saddam hussein regime because we did not face any problems as we marched for seven days to reach karbala
5227967 the security measures were in our interest as several pilgrims were attacked while on their way to karbala from baghdad
5227968 i had no fear this year the pilgrimage was successful
5227969 the initiative may spark a fresh and multilateral talk in the region
5227970 we are now 1 0 ahead of turkey by making an invitation now the ball is in turkeys field
5227971 hatay is still does not seem to belong to turkey in syrian maps but this does not hinder development of relations with syria
5227972 yes that might be true but syria has never asked parliaments of different countries to approve a genocide bill as a move against turkey
5227973 these are dirty tactics and a malicious campaign on their part and completely immoral
5227974 hes a master in psychological warfare as far as we are concerned sept 16 is a figment of his imagination
5227975 weve come to a mutual conclusion on what we shall present to the leaders of the coalition government
5227976 once they have cleared it we will be presenting it as part of a resolution and charge sheet in the joint houses and god willing that should happen this week
5227977 president musharraf says he will not bow to these pressures will not quit and will defend himself
5227978 we want stability in the country we want political stability we want to make progress in the light of the mandate that has been given to our government
5227979 does di li a deputy and akp deputy president take shares from unearned income by using his political power
5227980 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
5227981 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity
5227982 create an environment of trust and prevent any disruptive actions by the enemy
5227983 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5227984 you must understand there are a large amount of troops
5227985 from tomorrow russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5227986 its invasion of georgia will require the u s to re evaluate the strategic relationship between the superpowers
5227987 the fact is we have worked hard to bring them the russians into the community of nations we thought they were headed in that direction
5227988 we were the first in so well be the last out
5227989 theres so much emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
5227990 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the u s
5227991 it is astounding his individual records will be broken but who can say if his eight gold medals will ever be beaten
5227992 i hate the word freak but he is in a world of his own he is staggering
5227993 it cant be described well never ever see it again
5227994 hes a nice guy a good bloke and the last few years ive never seen him change
5227995 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
5227996 its like 90 yards of a touchdown it was so close but i didnt have much of a response
5227997 its disappointing i didnt win i have no regrets it certainly was a close race
5227998 he did a great effort good on him for winning he was the better competitor

5228002 i have heard that the school had problems and that it needed to be prepared for the earthquake but when i heard that registrations started i went to the school
5228003 when i told them that a risk for an earthquake existed and that the school was going to be strengthened they told me not to worry and that the schools foundations are strong
5228004 ive got plenty of time for world records in the future im focusing on the 200m
5228005 im ready to kiss it goodbye if he keeps on doing what hes doing
5228006 i felt myself pulling away from the rest and i could see him slowing down and im still pumping to the line
5228007 it was only a matter of time before he began producing times like hes producing now
5228008 i was not the favourite but i knew i had the talent to win the gold medal
5228009 i just want to enjoy this moment because im having an unbelievable year
5228010 its more than my best dreams so i want to enjoy the moment i know how difficult it is to win these things especially here winning for me is unbelievable
5228011 its very difficult to explain the way i feel right now it will take a few days before i realize im olympic champion
5228012 but this is for sure the biggest moment in my career in my life i will never forget this moment
5228013 some of the indonesian that have spent decades in sydney said that this yearss was the most successful and the biggest ever ri independence day celebration
5228014 we are trying to help the citizens who do not have any social security or who do not have enough income to take the necessary medicines from pharmacies we give the medicines written in those patients prescriptions without payment furthermore we examine the patients who cannot go to the doctors without any payment our working system is so settled that sometimes our pharmacist friends donate medicines to us
5228015 currently we have 250 types of medicines in our pharmacy in a broad range of products from bandages to prosthetic legs we are trying to provide for the needs of our citizens
5228016 i was chatting with a guard and he told me about a nearby coal mine i had never seen a coal mine so i went to check it out
5228017 the scene was terrifying bulldozers and trucks were everywhere the trees were being destroyed one after the other the villagers were bustling around to save at least the bodies of their olive trees to sell to local bakeries
5228018 we have been trying to grow these ancient trees using the banzai technique
5228019 they are already wild not fertile for olive farming but this was not my purpose i just wanted to protect them and now we will do our best for these beautiful trees
5228020 i hope we can use them to beautify our environment as we might with artful sculptures
5228021 and i tell them yes you can help but please not through me
5228022 people may think we are crazy no problem there are always some crazy men in the world backing crazy projects like this one
5228023 but no one could let those olive trees be destroyed they never die in natural ways but only at the hands of humans they are a real treasure for us now we are trying to shape them using banzai techniques which will take a long time and a lot of money but in the end they will be very special trees
5228024 the whole thing every race one after the other from winning by one hundredth of a second to finishing if off with a world record its an amazing experience
5228025 records are always made to be broken no matter what they are

5228070 were really proud to be in the same league as these amazing women
5228071 we went to lake casitas two years ago i believe on a training trip
5228072 i bottled a couple bottles of the water from there and i brought it all the way over here sprinkled a little bit on everybodys fingers and legs i mean im not superstitious or anything i think the key was hard work but it might have helped a little bit
5228073 before we left princeton we all gathered together at my house and we watched the race it was very inspiring just to see those women be so cool and resilient and just pulling through at the last bit
5228074 thats what we kind of envisioned during the first part of the race where we just wanted to think about us for what we could do i made a call for the 1984 girls and were gonna do them proud and we just started motoring to the finish line
5228075 the first thing you want to do is jump out of the boat and jump out of your skin but you dont have enough energy left to do it
5228076 we knew if we raced a perfect race things were possible
5228077 we kept trying really hard until the end and it feels great
5228078 romania has won the gold medal for so many years and we hoped to do the same
5228079 but theyve just able to focus on what they need to do theyre very professional but the most professional group ive ever worked with no fear they came down smiling to the boat house which was a good sign
5228080 it was weird in the first 500 we were up ahead and we were prepared for anything we were prepared to be down prepared to be ahead and nobody turned their head to another boat
5228081 we were streamlined we just looked straight ahead i cant really remember any other boats out there to be honest because it was all about how fast we could go it was the most beautiful peace
5228082 our goal was to not lose any ground we just wanted to row our race and we did we got faster every 500 it felt like we got faster but i dont know it got harder every 500 put it that way
5228083 i kept looking around and just feeling our length and then speed and just knowing how commanding it was
5228084 and i just started smiling everybody smiled because this was a sweet rhythm and it just gives them confidence i mean i was almost having to be the calming aspect because they were ramping it up and we just needed to let that hunter go and just force that rhythm and just let that rhythm go and it was nice
5228085 i visualized every night that i would be first across the line and i would be able to see everybody in my peripheral vision
5228086 thats the great thing about being in that bow seat you can see everybody ahead of you and if they were making a move gosh dang it im gonna make a move harder than that
5228087 so it was fun it was fun being back there watching all that unfold we saw romania push we saw netherlands push but i think we had an answer
5228088 hes been the one the voice in the back of my head
5228089 i think this medal is more his than mine i think its all my familys its not my medal i think i share it with a lot of people
5228090 im ready to put some more work in ive done extra workouts and i think those last 10 strokes thats all you think about you know what that was the day that i stayed after practice it all adds up
5228091 and if theres another athletic girl sitting there in modesto watching this thats how i got started so just try it you can be out here

5228111 the act defines a patient as being a person and taking all emotion out of it we argued because mcintyre was deceased she wasnt legally considered a person under the law

5228126 on the map of the world pakistan is now an important country by the grace of allah
5228127 unfortunately some elements acting for vested interests levelled false allegations against me and deceived people
5228128 they never realised that they could be successful against me but they never thought how detrimental it would be for the country
5228129 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5228130 without any change to the draft that was circulated to them recently
5228131 were not really too focused on that we werent paying any attention to that we were focusing on how we felt we went out there and did everything we could
5228132 we normally try not to focus on the scores its more if we did our best and today i felt like we did our best so
5228133 this week on crossing the line from the beginning of the second palestinian intifada in september 2000 through 2007
5228134 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5228135 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5228136 i pray the government stops this down sliding and take the country out of this crisis
5228137 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership

5228141 the paper trail needs to be documented chronologically from the very beginning of the error
5228142 in conducting this research and analysis in your audit please look back as early as jan 9 2008
5228143 it is a very important agency and we need it because its in charge of our roads and highways
5228144 how in the world can they make an error like that and expect everyone to say oh well
5228145 we meet regularly with the members of the sunset commission
5228146 were working with them to improve the conversation between the chairman and the members of the legislature
5228147 this is not just anyone asking you for a meeting
5228148 this is a key senator the chairman of the committee overseeing your agency
5228149 the last three months we have seen a kinder and gentler txdot
5228150 i think theyre in big trouble and the question is whether the agency is ready to fix the problem the second question is how far the legislature is ready to go
5228151 was bedoeld als satire maar als zodanig onvoldoende herkenbaar was en hoe dan ook iets waar rover niet mee geassocieerd wenst te worden
5228152 volledig en ondubbelzinnig afstand van te nemen en zijn diepe excuses aan te bieden dat heeft hij onvoldoende gedaan en dus heeft de voorzitter hem per onmiddellijk van dat woordvoerderschap ontheven
5228153 fok is een groot aanhanger van de vrijheid van meningsuiting maar in dit geval trek ik een persoonlijke grens
5228154 ik zou het buitengewoon toejuichen als iemand eventjes buitengewoon integer het woonadres van femke halsema opsnuffelt en die tent buitengewoon integer in de fik steekt dat wijf verdient niet beter
5228155 daarom nam ik even gas terug en kon ik weer op adem komen gelukkig was ik de enige die erin slaagde een rondje voorsprong te pakken

5228157 we have a headroom for raising tier ii capital of rs 3 000 crore
5228158 the technical and formal improvements in laws and administrative structure have not been matched by gains in independence in the judiciary and assurance of rights to a fair trial
5228159 at this time the independence of the courts and the assurance of fair trials are too limited
5228160 a sort of tit for tat as part of a diplomatic spat
5228161 this is a european army being accused of human rights abuses in africa it thus needs careful consideration by international human rights groups
5228162 this report is not just going to lie down but its going to be used to help bring to justice people that were involved in committing genocide
5228163 what is needed here is the release of a lot of information
5228164 its incredible that two african presidents were assassinated that night over the skies of kigali and that theres been no international inquiry had it been two european presidents assassinated there would have been an immediate inquiry
5228165 the nations court cannot sit as an appellate court on the judgement of the international court of justice in the hague
5228166 this was why even with the threats of contempt of court order by the aggrieved bakassi people the government was advised to proceed by making good its pledge to hands off the territory and allow the cameroonian government to assume its full ownership and authority

5228168 in q1 fy09 gross npls for sbi declined by 16 qoq in value terms and the ratio declined to 2 5 from 3 2 in q4 fy08 this was primarily due to implementation of the government s agricultural debt waiver scheme whereby some of the bank s existing npls are being claimed from the government this has also resulted in write back of rs 250 crore of loan loss provisions excluding these adjustments npls would have risen
5228169 going ahead performance of core assets such as sme loans vehicle loans and housing loans would be under serious threat as interest rates continue to mount and demand slows down leading to rise in npls we recommend a sell with a target price of rs 1260
5228170 we have come a long way from our first year
5228171 i kind of thought he was crazy but he did it
5228172 we have added many committed players and shed some less committed players
5228173 we have solidified our organization and have been improving our community relations every year
5228174 i was around since the beginning and went to all the games events and meetings with my mother and brother so i know a lot about the team for a 9 year old
5228175 someday i am going to be the owner of the organization
5228176 i am so fortunate to have the opportunity to cheer for a team that allows me to be myself and have fun in a relaxed environment
5228177 it gets hectic sometimes when i have to work late and then go straight to practice when that happens i dont get to put my girls ages 2 and 10 months to bed which i love doing
5228178 its tough but if you want to do it bad enough you find a way
5228179 i wish i could play til the day i die
5228180 we go to war together every week were real tight band of brothers style

5228182 my loyalty is to the democrats winning barack obama is going to have a serious problem getting elected for good reason the party needs to face the fact that without hillary clinton on the ticket the democrats will probably lose
5228183 there is a sense of entitlement that almost seems to be inbred
5228184 they are convinced hillary is the one who should be assuming the mantle and its tough to crack that

5228186 controlling the conformation of peptides is not easy our previous studies showed that soft landing can be used to prepare ultrapure peptide layers on substrates
5228187 the question we faced was in addition to controlling purity can we also control the structure of the molecules we showed we could
5228188 we found an interesting pathway to conduct different types of chemical reactions between complex molecules and substrates that will potentially enable us to prepare materials that cannot be made by standard methods
5228189 the obama campaign is changing the map they are not accepting the rules of the game

5228192 if the england manager tells you he wants you to lose weight then thats what you
5228193 you do whatever it takes to be a part of the national side
5228194 because of the injury and being out for a year i had a lot of in the gym and put a lot of bulk on
5228195 id perhaps bulked up too much its very difficult when youre out for a year especially for someone of my size

5228202 we sought an appointment with the governor on monday the bjp is ready for elections and is not interested in exploring any other possibility
5228203 the first thing steve and i do every morning once we have the coffee made
5228204 thanks for sharing and making the world a better place
5228205 the next best thing to sitting with a friend over a cappucino
5228206 we really tried to make it work but in the end it just was not possible without severe ramifications elsewhere
5228207 their deadline must have been earlier than the decision than when we started to get serious about making the decision
5228208 i get the thing well mr eastwood is so well beloved and this may have ramifications at academy time
5228209 but its over i said what i had to say he believes what he believes and thats that
5228210 after viewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and political allies with their advice i have decided to resign a grim faced musharraf said backed by pakistani flags and a portrait of the countrys founder
5228211 not a single charge in the impeachment can stand against me musharraf said
5228212 no charge can be proved against me because i never did anything for myself it was all for pakistan
5228213 on the map of the world pakistan is now an important country by the grace of allah he said
5228214 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan rice said
5228215 this is for the first time i have received an award which is not completely related to films
5228216 i have grown watching rajiv ji and have always admired him for his ideologies and vision its a great achievement to receive an award by his name
5228217 this award is special to me because of two reasons first the award is in memory of a person whom i admired because of his visionary power and secondly it has been awarded by deshmukh ji
5228218 its not a role that i carry home with happiness in deepti navals film do paise ki dhoop chaar aane ki baarish im cast as a girl who not only has to look plain she has to look ugly sometimes plainly repulsive its not easy playing someone like that it affects me badly so this was a sober birthday for me
5228219 my look and the wretchedness of my character will remind people of charlize theron in monster i think she won an oscar for that
5228220 normally ive a big party every year where i invite all my friends or i go off to one my favourite countries spain or france this year i was in no mood to travel or celebrate
5228221 my father who was seriously ill is recuperating at home and though hes well on the way to recovery i didnt feel like a noisy party this time i think im over all those party times
5228222 with just me my brother siddharth my bhabhi and my parents and a few very close friends including deepti of course i cant ask for anything more actually i can
5228223 my boyfriend chris could be with me but hes in the us working and unable to join me for my birthday never mind
5228224 ive everything i can possibly want but yes at the end of this year im getting myself a house in paris im just waiting for real estate prices to fall more its been rapidly falling all over the world and that includes france but surprisingly real estate prices are still high in paris itself i think ill wait six more months
5228225 so it was a double celebration in my house its very rare that both these occasions come together its even rarer that all of us in the family are together for a double celebration i guess i am one lucky girl

5228235 i kind of flew off the handle a little bit
5228236 military people need to have certain protections when theyre off trying to serve us in a war
5228237 one of the rights under the scra is that you cant foreclose on them
5228238 it doesnt take a genius to read a paper that says hey hes in the military
5228239 it looks to me like the bank screwed up badly and needs to make things right
5228240 the most typical case that we see is the bank is given notice of the service members activation sends them back a nice letter that says thank you for your service to the country and somehow theres a miscommunication between the banks legal department and the banks payment center and they put the mortgage for foreclosure
5228241 as opposed to something that a bank sees day in and day out this is something that comes up in an irregular fashion
5228242 they may be a little rusty and have to go back and check on the provisions
5228243 the night that i got off the phone with the woman from the collections agency i was in tears crying and shaking
5228244 until i got legal representation involved nobody wanted to hear what i had to say when we didnt do anything wrong
5228245 and the stories that mr michel was sharing with us were unbelievable stories of secret submarines and nuclear devices and german rocket scientists that we absolutely had never heard of before
5228246 and immediately found the web page for dr h george mandel
5228247 they showed me around and of course nothing was recognizable
5228248 theres one house still available apparently from that time and all the rest has been demolished
5228249 do you remember about how many americans were stationed at 1142 at that time
5228250 we had 250 german war prisoners underneath they were down underground at fort hunt
5228251 up on this far end was the two taller buildings one of them being the one we billeted in
5228252 well thats what we were hoping you would tell us
5228253 we actually have from veterans a photograph of on the day after the war ended hundreds of documents being burned at 1142
5228254 and it illustrates how critical it is to speak to these gentlemen because who knows what part of the story went up in smoke

5228261 i always knew though not by official documents and information kept from me about the existence of an agreement based on dont harm me and i wont harm you between the italian republic and organizations such as the popular front for the liberation of palestine pflp and the plo
5228262 was awarded an extraordinary capability for the direction of italian intelligence agencies and special forces after he received approval for the deal
5228263 according to the deal the palestinian organizations could establish bases in italy enjoyed freedom of movement when entering and exiting the country and could move around without undergoing mandatory security checks because they were protected by the secret service
5228264 during my time as interior minister i learned that plo people were holding heavy artillery in their homes and protected by diplomatic immunity as representatives of the arab league i was told not to worry and i managed to convince them to lay down their heavy artillery and make do with light weaponry

5228271 hawes geeft ons een blik op kafka door het sleutelgat met de broek op de benen maar de ge llustreerde tijdschriften waarop kafka geabonneerd was omschrijven als pornografie is hetzelfde als een gedicht van heinrich heine vergelijken met een slogan van mcdonalds
5228272 dit is een idioot die niets weet over kafka maar over hem schrijft alsof dat wel het geval is

5228277 if i was secretary of state and i had 100m of licence fee money to deploy with public service broadcasting values in mind would i spend it on bbc3 or would i spend it on helping channel 4 i think thats a very difficult question for the bbc to answer
5228278 im convinced by the case channel 4 is making for their need for assistance in some years time they dont need it now
5228279 i believe they are a very important part of the broadcasting landscape we must look seriously at where that help could come from
5228280 you are blessed my friend and i am blessed and together we shall meet the coming days
5228281 guys in a truck caught up with them thats all we know now
5228282 i just heard several gunshots and then screeching tires and i freaked out and called the police
5228283 i was woke up from a deep sleep to the sound of what i thought was someone throwing firecrackers out the window of a car and quickly driving off
5228284 sounded like the car had a big v 8 engine
5228285 its one of those areas we always keep an eye on
5228286 we never even so much walk down the street with them without holding their hands because we know stuff like that happens
5228287 its nice to give stuff but that takes 20 minutes then bingo youre on vacation

5228300 homelessness has an impact on education because it can take a toll on a students academic success

5228302 we try to keep kids in their home school as much as we can
5228303 so if a student is in a school with a particular kind of reading program we try to be very aware of that and make sure the teacher knows this is the approach that has been used
5228304 we have entered into an agreement with law enforcement and social services to communicate that as rapidly as possible
5228305 our central offices contact the school and make sure the staff at the school is ready to receive the student

5228315 small business owners and managers are clearly working harder than ever to weather the current economic storm and just when many of them really need a break they find they cant take one
5228316 what is notable is that were not seeing any fall off in the levels of phone calls made by small businesses during what should be a period when they should be taking summer breaks theyre working much harder just to stand still
5228317 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5228318 i pray the government stops this down sliding and take the country out of this crisis

5228328 unless im missing something the only type of consumer that would see any worth in this is someone who is totally strapped and desperate and willing to pay a really high fee to charge a mortgage payment or utility bills as sort of a last gasp effort
5228329 that is not the kind of customer that were targeting

5228455 people thought the jerdons courser was a block to progress but are now benefiting from the canals realignment because their compensation is generous and the only land they are losing is difficult to farm
5228456 the threat the canal posed set the birds future on a knife edge but now there is every chance that it will survive this development and with the right management eventually increase its numbers
5228457 the decision is an example of how governments communities and conservationists can work together for mutual gain without putting in jeopardy the future of a threatened species
5228458 it is crucial we find other sites hosting jerdons coursers and encourage both politicians and the people living nearby to support that work
5228459 we are hoping the courser will become the state bird of andhra pradesh to create a sense of pride and stewardship among all of those on whom its future depends

5228471 the survey paints a stark picture of the challenging business environment that has emerged in the uk over the past year with the economy facing its most difficult period since the early 1990s this is now compounded by high and uncertain oil and commodity prices creating inflationary pressures and fall out from the uk housing market downturn which has continued to gather pace at the same time we are seeing a new realism among businesses about the need to weather the current economic conditions with projected staff and capital investment both significantly down on this time last year

5228474 we expect the slowdown to be at its worst towards the end of 2008 and into early 2009 we also expect inflation to start falling back from early 2009 allowing the bank of england room to cut interest rates throughout 2009 nevertheless overall the performance of uk plc through 2009 is likely to be the weakest growth since 1992 when the economy grew by just 0 3 per cent however towards the end of 2009 providing wage inflation stays low economic activity looks likely to pick up

5228489 president musharraf has been a great ally there was prior to 9 11 a close relationship between the pakistan intelligence services and the taliban pakistan was one of only three nations that recognized diplomatically recognized the government of afghanistan at that particular time but the fact is musharraf has put his neck on the line in order to be effective in going after the extremist elements including al qaeda and including the taliban in pakistan there have been three attempts on his life two of those by al qaeda over the course of the last three years this is a man who has demonstrated great courage under very difficult political circumstances and has been a great ally for the united states
5228490 so theres no question in that area along the afghan pakistan border is something of a no mans land it has been for centuries its extraordinarily rough territory people there who move back and forth across the border they were smuggling goods before there was concern about about terrorism but we need to continue to work the problem musharraf just visited karzai in in kabul this past week theyre both going to be here during the course of the u n general assembly meetings over the course of the next few weeks we worked that area very hard and the paks have been great allies in that effort
5228491 pakistan weve gone in and worked closely with musharraf to take down al qaeda saudi arabia same thing in all of those cases its been a matter of getting the locals into the fight to prevail over al qaeda and al qaeda related tyrants
5228492 think of musharraf who puts his neck on the line every day he goes to work when thereve been attempts on his life because of his support for our position and they look over here and they see the united states thats made a commitment to the iraqis thats gone in and taken down the old regime worked to set up a democracy worked to set up security forces and all of a sudden we say its too tough were going home whats karzai going to think up in kabul is he going to have any confidence at all that he can trust the united states that in fact were there to get the job done what about musharraf or is musharraf and those people youre talking about who are on the fence in afghanistan and elsewhere going to say my gosh the united states hasnt got the stomach for the fight bin ladens right right the united states has lost its will and will not complete the mission and it will damage our capabilities and all of those other war fronts if you will in the global war on terror

5228512 this is a very diverse homeless and at risk population we need to address that diversity with different services
5228513 you get free food you have a free place to live i feel lucky its here
5228514 there are other kids here there are other parents here
5228515 its a place you can just hang out its like a family here
5228516 they dont want to go to school if they have to wear the same thing every day
5228517 theres not enough out there for kids not yet committing crimes but theyre at risk
5228518 they are helping make it a more cohesive coalition of services
5228519 we dont want to put services out there so its easy for youth to live on the streets
5228520 theres such a large percentage of youths that simply arent reached because they dont know there are services out there for them or they run into barriers like were full and they are put on a wait list and they move on
5228521 i can get you fed i can get you clothes i can get you a shower but i have to send you back out on the street where theres fear predators infection
5228522 right now given the limited resources that we have our best way to deal with them is through the services we have in partnership with other counties and in our county to find them shelter
5228523 the last thing i want is a child on the street or in the car
5228524 its a growing problem and we do not have shelters over here
5228525 if we were open a lot this is where the kids would go
5228526 theyre in distressing situations and just trying to get away from the distress
5228527 these gaps have to be bridged or youre never going to help these kids
5228528 until theyre fixed this community will deal with the fallout
5228529 were all working to make sure we dont duplicate services and were providing all the services
5228530 if you have a bunch of adults telling them what they think they should do that doesnt make for the most successful programs and outcomes
5228531 we have some catching up to do in terms of putting together the right resources and moving this population along
5228532 we need to have something tangible to offer youths to get them off the streets
5228533 we need to get community buy in that its an important thing
5228534 our goal is to meet the needs of all of the children in polk county and certainly homeless children are just a big of priority as any other children
5228535 in many ways they are an immediate red flag that we need to find services for
5228536 we need to support them locally so they dont go to urban areas where they are more at risk of becoming chronically homeless
5228537 its really important to have a global resource that can meet the needs of each community

5228547 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5228548 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

5228551 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5228552 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5228553 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

5228577 it is true that we the people of katagum need a state we have the numerical strength we have the natural resources the human resources and i tell you we can do it because we have all it takes to make it
5228578 dont also forget that the creation of katagum state is long overdue it has been on the table for a while and we are hoping that it will see the light of day because this national assembly under the leadership of senator david mark is focused and ready to do the right things
5228579 although there appears to be presently a harmonious relationship between the two the different positions they have taken on state creation will soon reveal whether their political collaboration will turn to enmity and political rivalry
5228580 the creation of southern kaduna state did not start today it has been on the table for a very long time this time around we have started on time and we are going to sensitise nigerians on the need for the creation of southern kaduna state
5228581 as you are aware kaduna state is about six million people and the southern part of the state is about three million so it is a state that could be viable economically
5228582 before i came here i met with the governor of kaduna state and i told him this is what we want and he said state creation is for development
5228583 go to gombe go to zamfara they have water they have electricity hospitals are coming up so i think it is what we call lack of deep understanding of development state creation is not a political thing i see it as a development thing which is aimed at bringing development nearer to the people
5228584 the creation of southern kaduna state is one that would follow the due process it is no longer going to be creation of states by military fiat there are criteria for state creation and we would ensure that we meet the criteria it is going to be constitutional we are going to follow the due process and i am very optimistic that we would get the southern kaduna state the desire of the people must be met
5228585 oh its going to be so hard to say goodbye i love you all too
5228586 toto were home home and this is my room and youre all here and im never leaving here ever ever again because i love you all

5228589 shines a harsh and frankly unflattering light on the attitudes we canadians have concerning mental health
5228590 people are afraid of what they dont know it just shows that we have to make a lot more effort to educate the public about mental illness

5228600 we want a situation whereby the electorate will be allowed to elect its right candidates not a situation whereby the ruling government will impose candidates on us look at what happened in bauchi state where the state electoral commission disqualified our candidates at the late hours and seven of our local government chairmanship candidates where denied their right by the commission so the government and the commission have really disappointed us
5228601 we cannot regard ourselves as an oil producing nation when we have to depend on importation
5228602 one year ago the sale of refineries in kaduna and port harcourt was reversed and performance to date has confirmed our belief that these facilities were not scraps
5228603 the sting operation was carried out following a petition by a group of kano based traders whose goods were being transported to kafanchan in kaduna state
5228604 the police claim they have stopped receiving applications and have started shortlisting candidates
5228605 i came all the way from kogi we all expected that the application entry will stop today friday but unfortunately we were not allowed to submit our applications we are aware that there are many people lobbying for their relatives inside there now
5228606 it is true that many people have been here trying to lobby but i can assure you that they have been turned down
5228607 the exercise was expected to end about two weeks ago but because of the large number of people that turned up the recruitment exercise was extended by two weeks so those who are crying foul only have themselves to blame
5228608 on our part there were no casualties just a few injuries
5228609 oh that kids here again hes always here alone for the last year and a half weve been coming here and weve seen him almost every time and ive never seen an adult with him he just wanders home whenever he feels like it my mom knows their family mom is a c a and dads a chiropractor here in town

5228611 you need to either use your best manners or stay away from the smaller kids please
5228612 oh yes you will if i say you will kiddo you have two choices use your best manners or play elsewhere now
5228613 we dont play with children like that we choose friends who have manners and respect other people
5228614 yes it is my mom made it and you better not wreck it
5228615 it belongs to everyone but we wont wreck it so dont worry why dont you go home and ask your dad to come back and play with you
5228616 we believe in the peace of the state at this period and the fact the election petition tribunal judgment has an over riding interest above all other interest in ekiti

5228622 i am the moshiach hashem has heard your plea your geulah has come its time to go free
5228623 just look at his hat at the pinches and brim
5228624 whoever heard of moshiach with a brim thats turned down
5228625 if this is the rule ill turn my brim up before i go to the next shul
5228626 if you want to be moshiach you must be properly outfitted
5228627 no difference to me what i wear on my head
5228628 youre the moshiach just imagine that whoever heard of moshiach without a black hat
5228629 if you want to be moshiach and be accepted in this town put some pinches in your hat and turn that brim down
5228630 i guess my time hasnt come ill just have to return to where i came from
5228631 yes its very wonderful that you all learn torah but you seem to have forgotten a crucial part of our mesorah
5228632 the first place to start is to shut up your mouths and open up your hearts

5228636 one voice south south legislative retreat on constitution review was facilitated by the publisher of vanguard newspapers chief sam amuka pemu an indigene of the niger delta while former judge of the supreme court chief adolphus karibi whyte chaired the summit which was also attended by all the state governors in region
5228637 we have a catch 22 situation we believe that the time has come to call for a cease fire to make peace and give this government an opportunity to test its good will
5228638 therefore because of the history of the country where there is evidence of clear marginalization of this particular territory we believe that the people who lead us must try to speak with one voice because there is strength in unity when the constitution is reviewed the people will have no choice but to agree that this particular territory which produces the oil but suffers degradation and deprivation deserves derivation as an obligation and not an option
5228639 if we have to live we should live as human beings if we do not live as human beings we have no good reason to be alive all we do while we are now alive we should make sure we live and look after ourselves by what we have and all god has given to us
5228640 it has always been accepted by everybody who claims to be a nigerian that the niger delta area which falls within the new regional zones has suffered tremendous neglect every successive constitutional arrangement had ignored it and nobody cares there were constitutions which tried to entrench what everybody would call true federalism but since after that time even the observation of the willinks commission has not been adhered to
5228641 nobody bothers whether there is a special responsibility the special difficulties of the terrain the special culture up to anything which comes from this area
5228642 it is from this place that all the slaves were taken away the oil palms and everything were taken out of this area fortunately god has so blessed us that it is still the centre which is sustaining this country with its oil and gas we have an inexhaustible reserve of gas so there is still a lot we can give to this country
5228643 it is bad that the federal government has visited us with injustice underdevelopment and other forms of marginalization but the worst thing about the situation is that we are the architects of our own misfortune killing and kidnapping ourselves while other areas like lagos and abuja are reaping the benefits of what we have
5228644 now lagos is taking all the oil and business capital that should have been here julius berger has pulled out of the niger delta and the 4 500 jobs they provided have gone with that pulling out because our own people kidnapped their workers who are providing infrastructures in the region
5228645 those who speak for us are no more the learned and the likes of justice karibi whyte but the likes of ateke who cannot speak english while oil business is going away to lagos and abuja the economy of this region is being built on criminality
5228646 a company in america wanted to set up a urea company here and when i asked them to come they agreed but asked for a guarantee on security which i cannot provide
5228647 traditional rulers and politicians whose ambition was to control their local government areas those struggling for positions and are arming the youths now the frankenstein monster has grown out of control and those who armed them can no longer control them they can no longer go home politicians are asking for more security and everyone is afraid of being kidnapped
5228648 these boys require force because they are not ideological in what they are doing if they were ideological i will bring the resources to back it up i have said it before that unless the law is enforced the problem cannot be solved
5228649 the problem is that we have lost value orientation these boys can no longer work because criminality pays them more how many of them can take a job of n250 000 they cannot because it is not enough to buy them the jeeps they use and maintain their life styles if they are rehabilitated and have value re orientation then things may still start working again but as it stands now we need to do something drastic to save the situation because our economy is dead
5228650 we went to a great extent and took a lot of risks to get the leader of the gang arrested three years later this same kingpin was released and he was one of the people that participated in the attack on bongo field if the law went after him it would not happen we should work more to deal with the situation
5228651 it is a national problem and the solution is within grasp
5228652 so what is the source of the current aberration my contention is that it is a national problem that festered because of absence of justice accountability respect and sense of reciprocal partnership
5228653 prior to 1969 there were no remarkable legislative clogs to the progress of the niger delta region the 1960 and the 1963 constitutions entrenched principles of derivation as the basis of resource allocation in nigeria encouragingly that principle stimulated all the regions geopolitical zones of nigeria to exert themselves exploit their resources and fully express their unique endowments as the petroleum resources of the niger delta witnessed price appreciation and sales explosion at the world market the nigerian oil boom became the doom of the niger delta region
5228654 this legislation which may have been a war time instrument for achieving national cohesion and even development has grown into a monster in our statute books the act was the origin of the unification of the power to govern and the power of ownership of oil and gas resources in the federal government
5228655 overnight all previous land owners became mere occupiers tenants lessees of their own lands
5228656 notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section the entire property in and control of all minerals mineral oils and natural gas in under or upon any land in nigeria or in under upon the territorial waters and the exclusive zone of nigeria shall vest in the government of the federation and shall be managed in such a manner as may be prescribed by the national assembly
5228657 simple acts of desperation to emasculate the people of the niger delta and exclude them from the management of the resources and were therefore pretentious and has reinforced the principle of excluding people from having lands irrespective of their state of origin other injustices flowed from it
5228658 oil is a curse due to the contractions of a dysfunctional political class we are maintaining the same position we have held at all constitutional conference true federalism the destiny of nigeria cannot be unlocked until we embrace the tenets of true federalism we support a 50 per cent derivation for a start
5228659 in doing so however i wish to advise that we remain within the confine of the constitution and also reasonably consider the interests of other political and socio economic groups existing in our federal system in our efforts to assert our rights we should be mindful of the need to grant other people the opportunity to exercise and promote their own rights therefore we must be nationalistic in our outlook i am sure as democrats we will pursue the path of honour in ventilating our feelings and in pursuing our legitimate demands
5228660 unfortunately we have now reached a point where groups use illegal means to ventilate the otherwise legitimate grievances and aspirations of the people as a people we must rescue the legitimate aspirations of our people by whole heartedly comprehensively and vigorously condemned criminality in all its ramifications any attempt to link criminal behaviour with the lawful demands of the niger delta people taints the legitimacy and moral quality of our universally recognized aspirations it is neither part of the aspirations of the niger delta nor in our character to breed criminals
5228661 unfortunately things took a turn for the worse following the intervention of the military in governance and the unfortunate and opportunistic reversal of norm following the discovery of oil in oloibiri bayelsa state in 1956 since oil gained centre stage as the major revenue earner producing about 90 percent of the countrys export earnings over 80 percent of bloc revenue and 40 per cent of the gross domestic product the country has moved away from the federal principle agreed by its founding fathers this unfortunate turn has spelt disaster for all of us
5228662 but the onshore offshore dichotomy abrogation act has been denounced as fraudulent reason being that the littoral states are not entitled to the continental shelf contiguous to them but are allowed a widely varying offshore that reaches a maximum of 200 meters depth only about 40 per cent of nigerias oil is produced offshore and most new offshore finds are in deep waters and under the exclusive control of the federal government
5228663 why have we decided to depart from the federal principle bequeathed to us by our founding fathers and continue to goad our nation state into a near unitary state thrust into perennial political turmoil distrust and injustice
5228664 why is my home state of bayelsa allowed only eight local governments when the constitution clearly prescribes a minimum of ten councils per state
5228665 as we prepare to work out a constitution that will reflect our hopes wishes and aspirations it is imperative that we ensure that it is truly one for
5228666 we have a historical duty to do away with this path
5228667 we must find common grounds amid the medley of our different communal and ideological aspirations
5228668 our understanding is that the constitution is the soul of our country subject of course to divine superiority
5228669 it has been observed that some of the sections dealing with the creation of local government and boundary adjustment in our constitution for example have been noted to be impossible to implement in the great trek to global peace economic prosperity and political stability nigeria must not be found wanting any obstacle to our ascendancy to greatness must give way
5228670 just governments must sometimes take the lives of unrepentant terrorist mass murderers in order to protect and uphold the infinite value of human life
5228671 in the exercise of his functions under this constitution the auditor general shall not be subject to the direction or control of any other authority or person
5228672 the office of the auditor general only provides the parastatals with a list of qualified auditors to be appointed by them as external auditors from which the bodies shall appoint and thereafter comment on the annual accounts and auditors reports
5228673 the world will not wait indefinitely for nigeria to organise itself and be fit for the giant economic strides being taken by post colonial states in circumstances similar to that of nigeria
5228674 is now to revolutionise and strengthen the microfinance banks and institutions to be the bedrock of rapid economic transformation through a sustained commitment to the development of smes we believe a conference such as this with such a personality will give our micro finance banks and institutions the right orientation that will equip them for enduring achievement
5228675 are not asking for charity charity is not a solution to poverty
5228676 for their efforts to create economic and social development from below
5228677 cannot be achieved unless large population groups find ways to break out of poverty microcredit is one such means
5228678 there was still a twinkle in his blue eyes yeah major
5228679 i was sitting down having a cigarette and he spotted me and made a beeline to me he got all of his security to close in so johnny couldnt get to me
5228680 so we were encircled and hes like how are you doing little lady
5228681 and he just lunged for me he kissed me on the lips then gave me a filterless cigarette i came off all lightheaded he was fabulous
5228682 just as christ was sent by the father so also he sent the apostles filled with the holy spirit
5228683 this he did that by preaching the gospel to every creature they might proclaim that the son of god by his death and resurrection had freed us from the power of satan and from death and brought us into the kingdom of his father
5228684 his purpose also was that they might accomplish the work of salvation which they had proclaimed by means of sacrifice and sacraments around which the entire liturgical life revolves
5228685 they continued steadfastly in the teaching of the apostles and in the communion of the breaking of bread and in prayers praising god and being in favor with all the people
5228686 the victory and triumph of his death are again made present

5228695 estoy muy contento de haber ganado aqu alemania es un rallye especial para m y como no podremos venir el a o que viene ha sido bonito terminar as nos hemos encontrado muy c modos con el coche todo el fin de semana y no hemos tenido ning n problema grave todo ha ido bien y ahora estoy en la mejor posici n de cara al resto de la temporada tal vez nueva zelanda sea un poco m s dif cil al salir el primero porque hay mucha grava sobretodo si no llueve pero de momento me alegro de liderar el campeonato y estoy contento con el trabajo que dani y yo hemos hecho para citro n
5228696 estoy contento porque un segundo puesto es un buen resultado para los dos campeonatos para m en el de pilotos y tambi n para citro n que se ha puesto a la cabeza en el de constructores
5228697 un resultado fant stico pero ha sido un fin de semana complicado con s lo un d a de test tras siete meses en casa lo he encontrado dif cil el primer y segundo d a lo pas especialmente mal pero el final no ha sido tan malo para m si pudiera hacer algunos test ser a mucho mejor mi pr xima prueba ser la de espa a pero si me pidieran que corriera en lugar de gigi en el rallye de nueva zelanda tambi n me gustar a mucho
5228698 hubiera preferido ser tercero pero el cuarto puesto sobre asfalto tampoco est tan mal
5228699 hemos marcado algunos tiempos buenos en los tramos y tambi n buenos parciales as que si podemos mejorar la regularidad no tiene mal aspecto de cara a los pr ximos rallyes sobre asfalto
5228700 no he tenido problemas hac a mucho que no ten amos una carrera tan limpia
5228701 me lo he pasado bien y el coche ha ido mejorando en adherencia y tracci n a n queda mucho por hacer pero vamos en la direcci n adecuada
5228702 he perdido tiempo con algunas peque as cosas y no he podido luchar con petter
5228703 tratar de mejorar para el pr ximo rallye de asfalto ahora pienso en la prueba de nueva zelanda
5228704 assured that georgians would not continue to use military force
5228705 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5228706 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5228707 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5228708 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5228709 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5228710 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5228711 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products
5228712 being killed by lack of originality most publishers are pushing crappy clones quickly made for little money and thats having a detrimental effect on the public because the public doesnt know what to choose doesnt find any good titles so it tends to go to established known titles and games nintendo games basically
5228713 right now at least steam or psn or wiiware or whatever or the web basically is not run by kmart or its not the same people so maybe theres hope
5228714 so as you may have heard we are being sued by our former record company for the ridiculously oversized totally unrealistic and pretty silly but slightly clever sum of 30 000 000
5228715 upward pressure on inflation is likely to continue throughout the year largely due to rising food prices and elevated oil prices the government recently raised retail fuel prices by around 10 per cent and we expect there is more to come
5228716 we believe wpi inflation will remain in double digit territory until may 2009 we expect wpi inflation of 17 per cent by september 2008
5228717 we have got the vision in this country internationally people have been using africa as an inspiration for years it is time for african designers to benefit
5228718 traditionally the only stories coming out of africa are of war famine and despots we are trying to put something else out there there are lots of beautiful things coming out of here
5228719 learned to be a lot more innovative we look at what we have and make do
5228720 as fashionable as traditional clothing may be it is not fashion it has to translate into something that has commercial appeal
5228721 i try to replicate the strong yet ethereal nature of the flowers growing in my garden i strive to find natures perfection in its imperfection
5228722 the whole swim took four hours i had to swim hard and fast because i was getting stung by a lot of jellyfish you couldnt see them because they have got tentacles metres long
5228723 i was up until 4am putting on ammonia and vinegar and its gone now as it last for about 12 hours i didnt realise it was happening until halfway in and then it was one after another i realised the longer it took me the more pain i would be in i switched my mind off
5228724 i never considered getting out i just carried on swimming
5228725 i have got a lot of swimming experience but it was just tossing me around
5228726 i am glad i have done it and to be the first person to do it but my sea swimming is probably over now i think i will stick to the lakes

5228735 the financials of the music business have changed to the point that we have to find ways to make money in other places
5228736 i didnt think six years ago when we started trying to sell music that wed be selling vitaminwater and shoes and clothes now were moving into other directions and four or five years from now its exciting to think about us looking at natural resources and raw materials and other businesses
5228737 people were talking about how much money i made but i was focused on the fact that 4 1 billion was made
5228738 i think i can do a bigger deal in the future
5228739 hes got the work ethic of a robot i think he works 24 hours a day
5228740 what if you could be whoever you wanted to be go to a fashion show and pick whether you see it from the models eye or the designers eye go to a recording studio and see it from the rappers perspective or the producers
5228741 you have to mention swizz when you talk about the top five hip hop producers of all time
5228742 he may have started with music but for many reasons hes become a brand unto himself

5228748 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5228749 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5228750 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5228751 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5228752 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5228753 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5228754 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5228755 working in harmony with nature is becoming more and more important as increasing demands are made on our environment the uks native species need our support and i hope todays announcement will help give the pool frog a secure future
5228756 it is vitally important to have this kind of protection in place for the pool frog before we could consider reintroducing them to new ponds in other parts of east anglia
5228757 early signs are encouraging that the pool frogs are settling in to the current release site however it will be several years before we can confidently assess the success of this reintroduction
5228758 our struggles are all inside our body and the world itself is just the container where these struggles are going on im not going to waste my time observing what doesnt last my paintings are about souls not bodies
5228759 there is a religious cultural dimension they are outcasts from their families and find succour in drugs ruffies rohypnol a date rape drug benzedrine an amphetamine cough syrup
5228760 i come from a religious family and i know what i am doing is a sin but i pray every day for god to create an opportunity for me to leave this business not just me but all the girls
5228761 grew up with it the idea is sold to you from six or eight its a way of life the girls see it as a rite of passage soon ill be on my own independent grown up
5228762 men made the vast majority of decisions in the household regarding not only major life issues such as large purchases but also more mundane matters such as daily purchases and meals sexual debut was often unwanted and traumatic for these young brides
5228763 a girl can be married at 12 and divorced at 18 with children to support
5228764 the way you change a car is the way you change a wife in kano you give birth to a few children and you can find yourself divorced for the slightest excuse
5228765 the north is a very traditional place to make inroads you must work with traditional religious leaders
5228766 what we dont have yet is many traditional leaders coming out to promote condoms a number of them have come to terms with the fact that people are having sex and were thankful that weve had some kind of silent support which hasnt opposed the intervention

5228800 iran should not present on a silver platter the justifications and the pretexts for those who want to drag the region down a dangerous slope
5228801 middle east sources report that the iranian satellite carrier space launch sunday aug 17 was prompted by a joint caution to tehran from saudi king abdullah and egyptian president hosni mubarak

5228813 president medvedev agreed but we cannot postpone and we cannot delay with these tasks
5228814 it is up to russia now to decide whether it will continue to defy the world or accomplish its final goal of regime change in georgia
5228815 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like

5228955 its not hind part before years its about going out through one being truthful on the mode of dealing in root open in the middle and life accurate in continuance the opportunity to pass aloud youre both a trickster or you break up and im not the first im the encourage and thats it theres in no degree mendacious in that places no bullsh
5228956 you cannot negotiate anything about final status if you dont talk about jerusalem final status consists primarily i believe of jerusalem and refugees if you want to postpone jerusalem you postpone refugees really you are not dealing with the problem you have to discuss these issues and that is exactly where the trade off has to be made
5228957 i still favor a two state solution and will continue to do so but to the extent that you discover its not practical anymore or that its not going to happen you start to think about what the alternatives are
5228958 but on the other hand if we are looking at what is happening on the ground in israel and the occupied territories you see things happening in the opposite direction as if they are not connected to reality thought is running in one direction reality in the other
5228959 we can fight for equal rights rights of existence return and equality and we could take it slowly over the years and there could be a peaceful movement like in south africa
5228960 i think one should maybe begin on the palestinian side to begin a debate to reengage in the idea of one state
5228961 it so happens that fatah in particular the mainstream party and the only viable alternative to extremes on the left or on the right now needs a strategy an ideology
5228962 these are isolated incidents but they do reflect a major sickness in our jerusalem arab society
5228963 what is the driving force behind a two state solution the fact that it seems more acceptable to a majority of people on both sides and therefore more applicable the primary motivation is to minimize human suffering this is what we should all be looking at if there will be a one state solution it will not come today or tomorrow its a long protracted thing not the ideal solution unless in an ideal world people really want to be together then it is the ideal solution the best solution the one that causes the least pain and that can actually be instrumental to a one state solution is to have peace now and acceptance of one another on the basis of two states
5228964 fifty 100 200 years down the road there will be some kind of conclusion sometime in the future however far away this future is i believe well be living at peace with one another in some way or another i am not sure how whether in one state or two states or in a confederation of states but people finally will come to live at peace in the meantime we will simply cause pain to one another its tragic it is very tragic because we know we can do it now that today it is possible with some guts leadership vision we can make it happen today we can reach a peaceful solution today the arab peace initiative proposed in 2002 is a fantastic chance the palestinians have adopted it theyll go with it all the way it is a perfect chance it doesnt even mention right of return it is even better than the ayalon nusseibeh plan but i am willing to accept it
5228965 because for israel however important jerusalem may be the primary factor is the jewish character of the state
5228966 the facts on the ground are making the situation irreversible
5228967 take the clinton parameters palestinian neighborhoods are palestinian sovereignty jewish neighborhoods are jewish sovereignty they are acceptable in principle but with realities on the ground like the expulsion of arab families from their homes in the sheikh jarrah neighborhood and the inhabitation of those areas by jewish settlers its going to be unacceptable on a practical level thats why we dont have time
5228968 ramallahs reaction was a bit worried they called me a few times a bit worried
5228969 we have a terrible situation our political bible our platform our moral values we need to be brought together again if not for creating a state then for our own sanity and for own values as a people apart from in ramallah everybody is living under very bad conditions the occupation is terrible the siege is everywhere pressure as it is the europeans are financing the occupation and the europeans are happy because they feel theyre doing something it cleans their conscience and the israelis are happy because theyre not paying for it and the palestinians are happy because they are getting their wages paid it keeps the economy going and people are getting complacent about it its dead money going after dead money
5228970 i said i want to tell you what you can do to transform yourself from a payer into a player make your money payments conditional on tangible progress in the peace process
5228971 i was in brussels i gave a talk and i said to the europeans if you want to pass on money do it only on the condition we build a state in which case it makes sense for you to spend money to build us an international airport but if in the end there isnt going to be an independent palestinian state why waste your money waste your money if you need to on integrating us into israeli society makes more sense pay the money for us to become part of israel to have equal rights raise our level of education bring our standards of living up but to have the pa taking all this money creating all this debt makes no sense maybe the europeans should link the aid they are giving us to real progress in peace talks so that both the israelis and the palestinians will be shocked out of their complacency or lack of commitment
5228972 the pa has no use if we fail to reach a peace agreement by the end of this year i believe it would be best to go back to the period when we were living happily under occupation we had a small civil administration they were paying back some 20 million a year to the israeli treasury so they were making money off us today we are creating year after year bigger deficits we are spending billions we have 160 000 employees half of them are security personnel who give us no security whatsoever we are spending masses of money on guns which we only use against each other and which provide us no security the whole thing is a mess
5228973 people in jerusalem why should they attach themselves to the muqata to ramallah
5228974 i was still hoping because before he went to the labor party he came and spoke to me i like this about him i knew what he was doing people were pushing him for a long time trying to get him into the system and he resisted but then at one stage i think he made up his mind maybe i can lead the labor party and then this is the best place for me to be i said fine do it i was unhappy that he became marginalized as minister without portfolio
5228975 would come to the palestinian people and say i initialed such a document
5228976 i believe that on israeli side olmert could do the same we dont know whether both leaders will be reelected but its worth doing even if theyre not because at least we know weve given this peace agreement a chance
5228977 i agree with sari nusseibeh that time is running out for the two state solution
5228978 i share his view that olmert missed a chance to get an agreement due to efforts to insure his own political survival the labor party will not succeed in getting back in power by attacking the other parties but only by raising the common banner of security and political agreements

5228983 from here on out i will only spend 4 hours a week unwinding on steam
5228984 only an artist would have thought of the brilllant articulation of space on the female body the geometric procession from spheres to triangles the light and shadow play as deep clefts meet tall plateaus the change in tone color and texture as you move around the body clearly artists had to have created the female form
5228985 but those simple things mean nothing compared to how all the parts work together touch the body in one place and it emits a sound from another a simple act can bring a new life the female body is an instrument more finely tuned than anything in the greatest symphonies this has to mean that the female body was created by none other than engineers
5228986 a vehicle should look like a vehicle not a hot dog

5229012 in general the global multi billion dollar alternative medicine industry is failing to deliver the sort of health benefits that it claims to offer
5229013 therefore millions of patients are wasting their money and risking their health by turning towards a snake oil industry
5229014 basically i was on pain pills for six years and when they cut me back i started drinking and thats when i quit taking the lithium
5229015 i started drinking like a fish and they called the police
5229016 all the pressure of life just builds up inside me
5229017 there are a number of people incarcerated here who could easily be handled within the mental health care system
5229018 there were a couple of guys who would have attacked king kong
5229019 i know theyre overbooked i think they figure that if youre in jail youre all right
5229020 in our treatment program we are seeing something very odd 70 percent of our clients are female five or six years ago three out of 10 clients were women
5229021 we are seeing a flood of young women with children coming into treatment
5229022 we need to do a better job of catching women early and not giving them an antidepressant when they need treatment
5229023 it is a vicious cycle where if you drink because you are depressed it doesnt work you keep drinking and get more depressed and finally get to a place where you cant break out of it nothing really allows you the freedom to focus on what you really need to be focusing on like family children and work you are so caught up in the cycle of trying to feel better you are not really free to function
5229024 most people dont get the proper treatment and die before they ever get well from this
5229025 the police said she was not to be there when the olympics began
5229026 this is almost a poster child example of what can happen
5229027 but wherever a child is if she is in need of care she should get it
5229028 this is tricky and i dont know how it plays out in the end
5229029 i dont care where she lives i just want whats best for kai
5229030 it was made clear that the issues surrounding kai had to be resolved by her leaving the country before the school could expect normal visa services to be resumed
5229031 since kais return to the u s a i am pleased to say that any obstructions to our visa application process have been removed
5229032 the key importance of this is that it gives us a clear idea of the sorts of chemicals and mechanisms in the brain that are involved in bipolar disorder
5229033 over a number of years that will help researchers to develop better approaches to diagnosis and treatment
5229034 the brain operates according to how quickly calcium and sodium are going in and out of cells and how much of it goes in and out
5229035 its not going to tell us the whole story it doesnt give you the whole puzzle but its something to build on
5229036 this was a kid at the very bottom of his psychological frame
5229037 he asked the family and questioned eric pretty hard about it to confirm that this behavior was specific to this manic phase of bipolar disorder
5229038 wiesel was selected by the perpetrator because of his identity and the jury made it clear there were serious consequences
5229039 i think he was desperately delusional for the entire thing
5229040 the chronology of this event shows him spiraling deeper and deeper into an obsessive depression
5229041 i think the jury had it right where they said we dont believe he was trying to kidnap him
5229042 theres an anxiety as survivors dwindle and there are fewer living testimonials that the message will be lost
5229043 this was a psychiatric problem and i dont think any kind of criminal act
5229044 but from mr wiesels point of view it was anything but a psychiatric act
5229045 im not proud of it but it was a shotgun
5229046 she was asleep at night and never knew what hit her
5229047 some old codger is going to get released and do damage
5229048 people should look systematically at what is happening instead of the dramatic exception
5229049 this legislation would be completely contrary to the longstanding policy of the united states government
5229050 subvert the federal governments criminal justice system of truth in sentencing
5229051 you dont have to walk to a toilet and you have hot and cold water right there
5229052 ive never seen fights up there we dont think about violence
5229053 were not trying to give them special favors but were trying to meet their special needs
5229054 i dont mean to say weve got a bunch of grumpy old men up there but it just takes one to irritate them all
5229055 once you get over 60 you dont see many petty thieves
5229056 there are a lot of ways to end a relationship without killing your wife
5229057 all they tell you is if they release you now it would depreciate the seriousness of the crime
5229058 i dont care if theyre 50 years old or 70 years old
5229059 ive got no family and im all by myself where are you going to go
5229060 they may be doing me a favor by keeping me here
5229061 i know this pretty rave girl i know something about her
5229062 if hes gifted me for all these things how do i know what he wants me to do now

5229064 as a deliberate challenge to the all too prevalent notion that designing for usability demands special insight into areas like psychology or visual arts that are outside the scope of what programmers can do
5229065 as an excuse for opaque and poorly thought out ui designs
5229066 thus routine confirmation prompts are a bad idea when confirmation prompts happen at all they should always be surprises that make the user stop and think
5229067 leads to grief dont train your users to have bad reflexes because even if it doesnt cause them problems when using your program it may well lead them into destructive errors while using someone elses
5229068 an interface is a poor substitute for packaging its capabilities in a clean and usable way but it is equally misguided and lazy to attack simplifications of an interface by claiming that they necessarily dumb it down the test for a good simplification should always be the same whether or not it makes the user experience better and that test should be checked with real users rule of predictability predictability is more important than prettiness remember that predictability a users ability to correctly model the operation of the program and assimiliate it to what he or she already knows is far more important than visual appeal and that you dont get usability from mere prettiness beware of pushing pixels around too much one of the most common failure modes in ui design is to create interfaces that are superficially pretty but difficult to use horrible examples abound and we will cite some later in this book conversely there are interfaces that are visually cluttered and ugly but highly usable well cite examples of this as well the latter failure mode is less common because it is much easier to polish the appearance of a ui than it is to engineer in better usability rule of reality the interface isnt finished till the end user testing is done far too many programmers who would never consider shipping a library without a test suite are somehow willing to ship programs that feature an interactive ui without testing them on real users this is the blunder in practice that makes violations of all the other rules keep on giving pain developers dont test so they either never find out how bad their programs usability is or find it out after they have too much invested in the interface design to change it easily user testing later in the process will be much less an ordeal if you make some effort to be in contact with end user reality while youre designing go out and talk to people who are likely to use the thing slap together a quick prototype and get them to complain about it at length get a piece of paper and ask them to draw the interface they want with a pencil you dont have to implement exactly what they say but it lets you know what theyre thinking rather than guessing at it another way to make the test phase more rapid and effective is to apply heuristic evaluation after you have a prototype but before you start looking for test subjects later in this book well describe a way to do that which is not a substitute in itself for end user testing but can go a long way in reducing the amount of it youll need before converging on a good result comparison with the nielsen molich evaluation method usability engineering
5229069 is the stance that approaches a task with no assumptions no habits perfect ignorance awaiting experience achieving beginners mind involves forgetting what you know so that you can learn beyond the limits of what you know

5229073 novelty to survive its demise was none other than clippy the painfully distracting
5229074 microsoft has never since attempted any advance in gui design that went deeper than improved eye candy once again the next steps forward came out of the unix world the unix resurgence
5229075 program flow much of programming is declarative hooking application functions into the callback slots of widgets rather than imperative
5229076 the east african savannah on which our ancestors hunted mated fought raised young and died for millions of years before newfangled inventions like fire the wheel writing and eventually computers bubbled up out of the hominid forebrain
5229077 the ability to do the right thing by unconscious or half conscious reflex is precisely what we normally mean by
5229078 circuitry or as a zen master would put it the mind is a noisy drunken monkey and our buddha self can only whisper the monkey has to be soothed into a flow state before we can hear
5229079 and many of our behavioral quirks such as programming into the still hours of early morning are patently designed to maintain it
5229080 an interface another kind of habit formation that builds expertise
5229081 as an abstraction or impersonal statistical profile but when we give the user a face and a name even a
5229082 so far this is all good aunt tillie the archetypal nontechnical user could handle this just fine forward
5229083 which is reasonable clicking on the menu i am presented with the following alternatives which i list here as text because of a technical limit in my screenshot tool
5229084 it is a page on adding a locally connected printer that is its associated with the currently selected by default queue type not the operation of choosing a queue the help is unhelpful
5229085 next to one so i can click and keep going
5229086 might mean but doesnt want to know and doesnt think he or she ought to have to learn
5229087 the prompt for server path presented here is a stone wall not only does it leaves aunt tillie with no idea how to proceed it is just as opaque to an experienced hacker like me
5229088 might be a safe default that other cups instances would honor
5229089 i see cups demons are running on minx golux and grelber but no queues are accessible
5229090 is this the same as a system root login or is there some special funky cups identity im supposed to telepathically know about the prompt on these password popups is configurable it could have offered me a clue and a pointer into the documentation it didnt
5229091 looked like it ought to be useful but i had no idea how to map these device urls onto queue names
5229092 well thats very nice but the breezy confidence of their exposition leaves me with no clue about what to do when the autoconfiguration isnt working
5229093 without any indication that its not on the local machine
5229094 the latter being minxs ip address restart cupsd and lo and behold my test job comes tumbling out of the printer
5229095 but you know what aunt tillie doesnt care she doesnt want to know about all the worlds printer types she just wants to make her printer work
5229096 is another way of stating the guiding principle of good ui design for end users

5229126 it is not true that he must necessarily play all matches it could be detrimental to him hes a great champion who must grow and mature with necessary calm
5229127 he will certainly be an important player for milan but this does not mean that hell play all the matches
5229128 im now in tottenham but no one can disagree with me wanting to follow my dream
5229129 im not angry about the decision of juande ramos to name me as a substitute im not crying

5229132 i noticed that eric cantona never smiled but i dont know if anyone ever asked him why he didnt look happier
5229133 we have two weeks until the end of the transfer window i think this will be the most important week
5229134 it is not with spurs and i think he is looking for a move
5229135 i think he is a very important player for the club you can see spurs without berbatov are a different team without keane as well they are a different team
5229136 they are huge players it will be very difficult to replace berbatov he is a class player he is not affected by anything around him
5229137 it was the same with keano he is one of the best players i have ever played with losing them i think will be difficult for spurs

5229146 we are working with the ncr to eliminate debt which affects every south african
5229147 we need to have about 3 500 debt counsellors to service the needs of consumers who are now looking for help faster than before
5229148 people who are within the income bracket of r5 000 to r15 000 are particularly affected by debt but it is a problem that affects people across the board
5229149 we had an incident in cape town where a woman was in financial trouble and on the verge of losing her property
5229150 we then referred her to a counsellor in vanderbijlpark gauteng who structured a payment solution for her which enabled her to keep her property
5229151 after we add up all your debt and work out a plan we will determine suitable instalments for you
5229152 its a beta theres gonna be bugs thats why they test it
5229153 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5229154 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5229155 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5229156 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5229157 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5229158 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5229159 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5229160 after discussions in recent weeks with the amaury group and thanks to the intervention of the ioc and a mediator in the shape of jean claude killy we are announcing a new initiative for professional cycling for the coming years
5229161 we have agreed on the basics and i hope that can lead to further discussions in the coming weeks
5229162 ive spoken to the organizers of the giro ditalia and the tour of spain about the new developments and the response from all the different parties has been very positive
5229163 we are looking at the creation of a uci world calendar as of 2009 which would include the races on the historic calendar and the pro tour
5229164 it would be accompanied by a rankings system for individual riders teams and nations
5229165 then from 2011 onwards the rankings system would be used as criteria for qualification to the tour de france
5229166 ecb chief executive davd collier was at the meeting and he will report back
5229167 they have a board meeting in london on tuesday to discuss the issue
5229168 the meeting lasted two hours and it was an opportunity for all the players to ask whatever questions they had about the tournament
5229169 david collier and hugh morris managing director of the england team were both there and they heard the views of all the players
5229170 they will report back to the ecb board on tuesday but i dont know when a decision is going to be announced

5229175 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5229176 storm of protest that mikhailovs conduct generated among jews and the mainstream media in russia and abroad
5229177 is it not true today as it was in the 1920s and 30s that delay and irresolution on the part of the democracies simply invite future threats and graver dangers
5229178 wer f r gazprom arbeitet sollte k nftig bei themen die russland betreffen besser schweigen

5229184 kami bisa bahagia melihat awal bagus yang sudah kami lakukan meskipun kami belum bisa merayakannya karena masih ada 33 pertandingan yang harus dilalui tapi saya pikir kami bisa menjadi juara kami cukup kuat dan tim telah memulainya dengan bagus
5229185 thats why im happy i pitched the complete game that it was shutout too thats better
5229186 it was actually kind of boring out there it made for great watching
5229187 he was very adamant about going back out for the ninth
5229188 which is a good thing when you can you like to reward them for all the other times weve had to take them out
5229189 its always good when you give your team and your bullpen a break
5229190 more than anything thats what i was trying to do and as you go in the game and then you see how everything is coming along i was just trying to do my job
5229191 thats why im happy i pitched the complete game that it was shutout too thats better

5229203 both are going quite well inside asus and we have strong confidence that our x58 motherboard will be the 1st motherboard on time for intels launch regarding the x58 nf200 board will be a little bit late than x58 board but were quite sure asus will still be the first in the market
5229204 and the stories that mr michel was sharing with us were unbelievable stories of secret submarines and nuclear devices and german rocket scientists that we absolutely had never heard of before
5229205 and immediately found the web page for dr h george mandel
5229206 they showed me around and of course nothing was recognizable
5229207 theres one house still available apparently from that time and all the rest has been demolished
5229208 do you remember about how many americans were stationed at 1142 at that time
5229209 we had 250 german war prisoners underneath they were down underground at fort hunt
5229210 up on this far end was the two taller buildings one of them being the one we billeted in
5229211 well thats what we were hoping you would tell us
5229212 we actually have from veterans a photograph of on the day after the war ended hundreds of documents being burned at 1142
5229213 and it illustrates how critical it is to speak to these gentlemen because who knows what part of the story went up in smoke
5229214 she says well youre not going to be happy and youre going to go crazy
5229215 i kind of flew off the handle a little bit
5229216 military people need to have certain protections when theyre off trying to serve us in a war
5229217 one of the rights under the scra is that you cant foreclose on them
5229218 it doesnt take a genius to read a paper that says hey hes in the military
5229219 it looks to me like the bank screwed up badly and needs to make things right
5229220 the most typical case that we see is the bank is given notice of the service members activation sends them back a nice letter that says thank you for your service to the country and somehow theres a miscommunication between the banks legal department and the banks payment center and they put the mortgage for foreclosure
5229221 as opposed to something that a bank sees day in and day out this is something that comes up in an irregular fashion
5229222 they may be a little rusty and have to go back and check on the provisions
5229223 the night that i got off the phone with the woman from the collections agency i was in tears crying and shaking
5229224 until i got legal representation involved nobody wanted to hear what i had to say when we didnt do anything wrong
5229225 botswana does not accept the result of the june 27 run off election in zimbabwe as it violated the core principles of sadc the african union and the united nations
5229226 brought into question in some quarters the integrity of sadc as an institution capable of promoting the rule of law and democratic governance
5229227 the idea that the chocolate we feed our children the chocolate we enjoy so much could be tainted by slavery was disturbing
5229228 in thailand girls are still sold into brothels today these teenagers are more likely to come from neighboring countries like burma laos or cambodia but their enslavement and destruction are the same
5229229 is an important step in our efforts to protect the united states and our european allies from the growing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles
5229230 i work with the railways but if i buy a pair of boxing shoes i have to worry how to meet my monthly expenditure
5229231 i dont aspire for private jets or trendy cars i just want decent jobs for boxers and some financial security for them so that they can concentrate on their craft
5229232 dreams are not what you have while sleeping they are those that do not allow you to sleep
5229233 we will not tolerate and will crush any attempt to disturb peace and development in mindanao
5229234 we are now taking military action to stop these atrocities
5229235 i heard the passengers left behind pleading for their lives and then i heard the guerrillas fire at them all
5229236 i did not hear any more voices after the burst of gunfire
5229237 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart at the time sh
5229238 students feel secure to know that if there has been an incident ie bullying we can then go back and look what happened
5229239 where there is not a high level of trust staff may have concerns that evidence may be gathered against them
5229240 no one really knows enough about the use of cctv in schools its a very new issue
5229241 certainly we would want staff to be involved in decisions about the use of cctv in schools and strict safeguards for its use
5229242 although surveillance in schools can have some positive outcomes such as discouraging vandalism and violence we think there are some instances where it should be strictly controlled
5229243 lho ucciso io lho buttato dal balcone perch quel bambino era figlio di mio marito
5229244 basically what john mccains done is hes hired the same old folks who brought you george w bush same team and its the same strategy
5229245 they dont have something positive to say about what theyre going to do for america what they try to do is they say well this other guy hes unpatriotic or this other guy he likes french people thats what they said about john kerry
5229246 they try to make it out like somehow democrats arent tough enough or arent macho enough thats their strategy and they do it every four years
5229247 and then you end up with what weve got right now ive got news for john mccain my plans not going to bring about economic disaster we already have economic disaster because of john mccains president george w bush
5229248 the mccain campaign wants to make this election about me because the issues arent on their side dont get fooled by paris and britney and nasty e mails that folks are sending out dont get fooled by them this election is about you its about us and whether we are going to meet the challenges that lie before us
5229249 mccain s personal fortune traces back to organized crime in arizona
5229250 if you can show us that the information presented in our mailer is untruthful we will stand down
5229251 i believe god has placed mr obama on his earth to make us a greater nation
5229252 transporting nuclear waste is way ok just not in my state
5229253 back on the campaign trail after his hawaii vacation sen barack obama looked tanned rested and ready to fight back
5229254 oh if america lets people have private rights well then she deserves to be hit by terrorists
5229255 my opponent wants to keep telling you lies about me
5229256 bush bush bush with a picture of mccain remember when the rightwingers though bush was jesus what idiots
5229257 if a republican was involved in this kind of a hate church you would want to lynch him
5229258 we already have economic disaster because of john mccains president george w bush
5229259 she says well youre not going to be happy and youre going to go crazy
5229260 i kind of flew off the handle a little bit
5229261 military people need to have certain protections when theyre off trying to serve us in a war

5229268 the night that i got off the phone with the woman from the collections agency i was in tears crying and shaking
5229269 until i got legal representation involved nobody wanted to hear what i had to say when we didnt do anything wrong
5229270 jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think i have ever met
5229271 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
5229272 ive written one so people better go see it itll allow me to make the next one
5229273 i kissed a girl and i liked it the taste of her cherry chapstick
5229274 i hate the song it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting
5229275 katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family and she knows how disappointed her father and i are i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
5229276 katy is our daughter and we love her but we strongly disagree with how she is conducting herself at the moment
5229277 we cannot cut her out of our lives as she is our child but she knows we disagree strongly with what she is doing and the message she is promoting regarding homosexuality which the bible clearly states is a sin
5229278 but the bible also promotes understanding and forgiveness which i keep reminding myself
5229279 youre extremely annoying you find everything super duper whoopedy doo
5229280 no one wants to piss off the favourites best friend
5229281 noel gallagher said i should learn three chords on the guitar and go write a tune
5229282 so i just wanted him to know that im actually taking guitar lessons from jay z right now and hes already taught me both chords to wonderwall tune
5229283 in fact its so much fun having jay teach me all of noels songs on the guitar hooray that im thinking of doing an oasis jay z remix album a la
5229284 potential titles are champagne superhova or definitely jay z ill keep you posted
5229285 p p s noel i did write a song called back to black which actually has seven chords in it
5229286 sure we bellyached but we knew we had to adapt or die
5229287 we educated ourselves about stock assessments by catch regulations and mitigation
5229288 have not been shown by any credible research to improve student achievement
5229289 a sizable majority of these studies report beneficial effects of competition across all outcomes the above evidence shows reasonably consistent evidence of a link between competition choice and education quality increased competition and higher educational quality are positively correlated
5229290 through partnerships with universities nonprofit groups and other organizations community schools provide the learning conditions and resources that support effective instruction and bring crucial services to an entire community
5229291 ellen si portia au pozat alaturi de mama ellenei si de cei doi catei ai cuplului s au imbratisat s au sarutat si pareau foarte fericite ellen a ajutat o pe portia carandu i trena de la rochie
5229292 ne am dorit foarte mult sa facem acest pas si vrem sa fie legal suntem foarte foarte incantate
5229293 we now can study how iaps contribute to the development of cancer in a living animal and develop drugs to prevent or thwart the disease
5229294 cancer cells thrive by disabling the molecular machinery that tells sick cells to die
5229295 by removing the ring we wanted to see whether we would trick the machinery to turn back on and thats what happened cells die more readily making it much more difficult for cancer to be established
5229296 we need to use genetics to sort out which individual iaps contribute to tumors and which iaps we need to target in order to cure cancer
5229297 this was a very big step in understanding what role iaps play in cancer but it isnt the last
5229298 were finding that hope is consistently associated with fewer symptoms of depression and the good news is that hope is something that can be taught and can be developed in many of the people who need it
5229299 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
5229300 many of the people who seek therapy are not mentally ill they dont meet criteria for depression or other illnesses
5229301 so if you focus primarily on what is wrong with them there may not be much progress
5229302 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
5229303 were finding that people can learn to be more hopeful and that will help them in many ways
5229304 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well
5229305 and the great news is that it seems to work we can teach people how to be more hopeful
5229306 the b cells have been waiting for at least 60 years if not 90 years for that flu to come around again
5229307 these are some of the most potent antibodies ever isolated against a virus
5229308 the lessons we are learning about the 1918 flu tell us a lot about what may happen during a future pandemic
5229309 many people still assume that parenting ends when a child turns 18 but in our culture today there is a longer extension of adolescence
5229310 everything is not lost if you are the parent of a college student and trying to do a better job
5229311 if you are open and ready to listen to what they have to say that will help you build a stronger relationship
5229312 our approach is unique in the world no one else has yet developed customized immunotherapy using the virus from individual patients
5229313 this experimental technique remains long and costly for the moment but were hoping it will hold the promise of a completely innovative and widely available treatment in the future
5229314 at this stage we have shown that the technique doesnt cause side effects or an undesirable auto immune response
5229315 health canada has approved a multicentre clinical trial across the country that will let us further assess the techniques effectiveness at controlling hiv reproduction were hoping that the fda in the united states will also give us the go ahead soon so that our pharmaceutical partner argos therapeutics can begin testing in the united states
5229316 imaging and measurement resolutions as well as atomic structural ambiguities defects obscured the results of most experiments and provided unreliable mechanical predictions
5229317 we can be certain of all the quantities we have measured and the results match quantum mechanics predictions very well
5229318 irradiating a multiwalled carbon nanotube with an intense electron beam actually forms bonds among the shells of the tube this is like combining multiple nanotubes into one to form a stronger structure
5229319 the same procedure used to strengthen individual multiwalled nanotubes by irradiation may also be used to link together individual nanotubes into a bundle
5229320 the finding is significant because it changes our understanding of how light input from the eye can affect activity and sleep patterns
5229321 this suggests that we have discovered an additional mechanism for regulating nocturnity and diurnity that is located in the light input pathways of the eye
5229322 the significance of this research for humans is that it could ultimately lead to new treatments for sleep disorders perhaps even eye drops that would target neural pathways to the brains central timekeeper
5229323 currently one in 28 americans age 40 and over suffer from blindness or low vision and this number is estimated to double in the next 15 years
5229324 our discovery of the switching mechanism in the eye has direct relevance with respect to the eventual development of therapies to treat circadian and sleep disorders in the visually impaired
5229325 we had previously demonstrated that grp stimulates the growth of this particular cancer
5229326 this time we wanted to demonstrate the opposite effects by targeting grp receptors in neuroblastoma to see if we could make the cancer regress
5229327 in order for cells in a soft agar colony to proliferate and grow without adhering to a surface they have to possess malignant properties as in the original neuroblastoma cells
5229328 however our grp receptor silenced neuroblastoma cells behaved like nonmalignant cells their growth was significantly inhibited and they formed fewer new colonies
5229329 we wanted to see how these neuroblastoma cells would behave whether they would grow and or metastasize to the liver
5229330 the cancer cells that expressed the grp receptors behaved as we expected with rapid growth as well as aggressive liver metastases the implication is that the metastatic behavior of this cancer is driven by grp and its receptor
5229331 with the publication of our data we would like to propose an application involving a number of institutions to move forward with a phase 1 clinical trial using this fda approved grp receptor antagonist for neuroblastoma
5229332 we hope to demonstrate the safety of targeting grp receptors for effective inhibition of neuroblastoma growth and metastasis this is just such a tragic disease and with all the advances were making we ought to be able to make a dent in it
5229333 if we really want to prevent hiv from spreading perhaps the first thing we need to let people know is hiv aids is not limited to any specific group of people
5229334 is not an endemic restricted to sex workers or drug users only
5229335 when it comes to hiv aids it is more than just a disease the social harassment and stigmatization to hiv positive people persist because weve still not been able to accept that were not an exception either
5229336 the most intriguing finding was that subjects seemed to accept mushrooms as a palatable and suitable culinary substitute for meat
5229337 they didnt compensate for the lower calorie mushroom meal by eating more food later in the day
5229338 they dont see as much difference between themselves and others
5229339 students who dont cheat seem to be in the minority and have plenty of opportunities to see their peers cheat and receive the rewards with little risk of punishment
5229340 we see avoiding cheating as a form of everyday heroism in an academic setting
5229341 the heroes didnt rationalize cheating the way others did they didnt come up with excuses and say it was ok because lots of other students were doing it
5229342 these 29 percent are like undecided voters they would be an especially good focus for intervention
5229343 our results suggest that interventions may have a real opportunity to influence at least a quarter of the student population
5229344 we need to do more to recognize integrity among our students and find ways to tap into the bravery honest and empathy that was found in the academic heroes in our study
5229345 we are pleased to see that the mva based candidate tested in chennai was safe and showed promising initial immune responses we do not know whether these observed responses will ultimately translate into an effective vaccine that will help protect individuals from hiv infection but hope to learn more through further testing
5229346 india is playing a significant role in global aids vaccine discovery efforts given our strong medical and scientific capabilities there is a need for continued efforts for the creation of novel reliable mechanisms for long term research on aids vaccines and other new prevention technologies
5229347 consistent innovation in science despite setbacks has ensured the development of many effective prevention technologies the successful conduct of the trial in chennai re affirms the need for continued vaccine development initiatives where learnings from every effort will contribute to global advancement of the aids vaccine field
5229348 state lawmakers look at their budgets the two largest expenditures are education and medicaid
5229349 loath to cut education funding especially during the school year
5229350 this is a recurring problem states have during every recession
5229351 there is good support for fiscal relief by several key members of congress
5229352 but it all depends on whether congress does a second fiscal stimulus package and that is looking increasingly doubtful with president bush saying he would veto any more fiscal stimulus
5229353 earned 13 8 million in performance payments for improving the quality and cost efficiency of care as their share of a total of 17 4 million
5229354 by working in collaboration with the physician groups on new and innovative ways to reimburse for high quality care we are on the right track to find a better way to pay physicians
5229355 have profound implications for shaping health care reform in america
5229356 wer sich nicht mit anstand besaufen kann sollte f r die nacht in der gewahrsamszelle auch bezahlen
5229357 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5229358 if a hunter is walking through the woods and he sees something ruffling in the bushes but isnt absolutely certain of its identity is he wise if he shoots it or wise if he waits to be sure what it is
5229359 its so hard to leave you have to worry about break ins if youre here you can keep an eye on things
5229360 as long as the grotto stands key west will never again experience the full brunt of a hurricane
5229361 in addition to providing clear benefits for women and their families by helping women avoid pregnancies they do not want and plan the pregnancies they do studies show that family planning clinic services save 4 3 billion in public funds each year
5229362 filling a big need for low income women and providing a really important service
5229363 suggests that private providers are beginning to focus on the contraceptive needs of women
5229364 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
5229365 and i also feel that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
5229366 that does not mean we exclude people from our party who are pro choice
5229367 not do anything that would be disruptive to what has been very important to the republican platform
5229368 end mccains bid for the presidency and spell defeat for other republican candidates
5229369 some people in the movement say it would be a kiss of death
5229370 the point that mccain was making is that people can differ on one issue and still be a vital member of our party
5229371 the fact that governor ridge is not perfectly in line with the party platform does not make him any less of a republican
5229372 pro choice americans know that this flip flop is not indicative of a policy shift or a reverse course for the anti choice and anti birth control mccain it is clear that mccain is nervous about his diminishing support among independent women a key voting bloc that will likely determine the outcome of this election mccain knows he needs pro choice independent and republican women to win in november but his extreme position on a womans right to choose makes it increasingly difficult to attract these voters
5229373 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia
5229374 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5229375 i think it was pretty obvious weve got a lot of work to do based on tonight in all three phases of the game
5229376 it was a good opportunity for us to go against a quality defense
5229377 i know they had some guys out but this team is a really good team and for us to come out and put a drive together to start the game was good for our confidence
5229378 i played with luke before so it was an opportunity for us to run some old plays
5229379 he and i played together in cleveland so we have a way of connecting i kind of had an idea he was going to throw it because of the way the coverage looked we just happened to make the play
5229380 we got some experience against a good team against a fast team against a playoff team
5229381 theres a lot of things were going to need to do better

5229385 we had a meeting with the education secretariat and made presentations to the ministry gnh commission and the cabinet we were supposed to start tendering this month but have not been informed of it yet
5229386 when it came to implementation the total amount projected by the consultant worked out to over nu 2 0 billion that was lot of money so the government thought we should review the amount
5229387 the reason why the buildings have space underground is just to be under subdue of tashichodzong

5229390 i bought it because of my interest in old cars and i found this car quite interesting
5229391 my son believes that its bulletproof and my familys very attached to norbu we make sure we ride in it once a week especially on sundays around thimphu
5229392 the car has lost track of its mileage but it must have travelled a million kilometres today
5229393 i heard from his family that this car was a very lucky one and the most precious commodity for him
5229394 but ill keep it as long as i can and enjoy its charm
5229395 you should have most of the shinto vocabulary down just from magic cards
5229396 i think most bhutanese have the tendency to blame everything on fate but what well tell them is to be a doer and not just expect things to happen
5229397 some of our sessions will also be conducted in dzongkha so that we can promote our culture and identity
5229398 we can learn a lot and it would help us throughout our life even if we dont get this title
5229399 i hope to develop into a better person and to be more aware about my environment and society

5229403 this is pop culture encountering nazi germany and the holocaust with unprecedented force
5229404 all the german historians and critics who were left gasping for breath by tom cruise and his worthy attempts to produce a correct image of stauffenberg they will be so shocked by inglorious bastards that they will savage it on the spot

5229437 this can be a powerful tactic especially for websites competing with those of big corporations

5229489 a place for everything and everything in its proper place
5229490 i am both saddened and frustrated to know that we have been in a position to help ease the suffering of hundreds of thousands of people and help mitigate further loss of life but have been unable to do so because of the unrelenting position of the burma military junta
5229491 there remains a serious lack of sufficient and sustained humanitarian assistance for the affected populations
5229492 a clear understanding of the support being provided by the government of myanmar to its people
5229493 if we were in a normal response by week four those affected should be working toward recovery
5229494 they would be in a position perhaps to think about what they need to restart their lives but we know people on the ground dont have food to eat
5229495 for aid agencies it is very important that those affected receive a full complement of appropriate aid
5229496 to say that a certain percentage of people have received aid means little because some survivors may have received a tarpaulin but no food and vice versa
5229497 its unconscionable for burmas generals to force cyclone victims back to their devastated homes
5229498 claiming a return to normalcy is no basis for returning people to greater misery and possible death

5229502 this is a dream start for me but ive not really done anything special yet and i wont be getting carried away at all
5229503 i missed our european champions league game against steaua bucharest last week a 2 2 draw and i was itching to get out there
5229504 im feeling great and hopefully this is a good sign for the rest of the season its really the perfect start for me
5229505 im feeling right at home with this bunch of players and the club in general and scoring on my debut makes it all the sweeter for me
5229506 weve got the return coming up on august 26 against steaua and we have a lot of work to do there to get to reach group stage of the competition
5229507 it means so much to the club its fans and of course the money it brings in so im really focused on trying to get us a result there
5229508 also the turkish season starts this weekend so ive really only taken my first step but its so far so good as far as im concerned
5229509 we have six massive games ahead of us between now and next june and i aim to be a part of every one of them
5229510 uzbekistan will be a hard to place to go its unknown territory for us from all accounts they are very strong but im sure pim verbeek will have us well prepared
5229511 now that im in turkey its going to be a lot easier on the body for me to travel to places like tashkent or the middle east where australia face qatar and bahrain than it was when i was based in england

5229520 we had some successes and some didnt work out it was not an overwhelming success
5229521 dont buy it because someone says its the next hot deal because its almost an assured way of losing money
5229522 if someone is going to invest in art pick an artist or medium in which you are comfortable and if you are going to do it on your own you can in a worst case enjoy the fruits of your investment
5229523 i dont think art is a good thing for most people to invest in it isnt very liquid
5229524 you have to know what you are doing because the majority of art is not resellable
5229525 whenever you buy anything you should buy the best buy quality
5229526 when you pay a lot for a work of art make sure the artist is established
5229527 if you dont have a passion you really shouldnt invest in it i dont think great work is bought by committee
5229528 wat dan geen werkelijkheid is net als bij t spreken van de waarheid leuk als je van te voren weet hoe iemand spreekt vaak is dat toch in patronen en die patronen komen altijd terug bij alles en iedereen wij waren net met een pure paradox bezig toen we aan onze eerste koffie zaten als er twee zijn die van hun patronen zijn afgeweken dan zijn wij t
5229529 als je dus iemand niet meer saai wil laten zijn moet je diegene dus confronteren met andere patronen of dat hij er zelf van af weet te wijken
5229530 we moeten de mens ook niet al te veel af willen schrikken uiteraard
5229531 juist maar daar moet je erg mee oppassen met tegenstrijdige acties jaag je veel eerder iemand tegen je in t harnas en krijg je ook vaker dezelfde reakties terug alsof ze t uit een soort van wraak doen en bovendien blaffende honden bijten niet

5229533 earlier boxing did not enjoy this much popularity but these guys have really made it big this time
5229534 before going for olympics these boys would often come to my training centre to get a feel of diverse venues and to get used to the spectators they were very confident and were determined to make it big and that is what has made the difference
5229535 its not that there was less exposure earlier or the training techniques were inferior its just that this time these boys were psychologically programmed to think only of victory i am sure this determination will take them really ahead

5229691 military people need to have certain protections when theyre off trying to serve us in a war
5229692 one of the rights under the scra is that you cant foreclose on them
5229693 it doesnt take a genius to read a paper that says hey hes in the military
5229694 it looks to me like the bank screwed up badly and needs to make things right
5229695 the most typical case that we see is the bank is given notice of the service members activation sends them back a nice letter that says thank you for your service to the country and somehow theres a miscommunication between the banks legal department and the banks payment center and they put the mortgage for foreclosure
5229696 as opposed to something that a bank sees day in and day out this is something that comes up in an irregular fashion

5229703 theres one house still available apparently from that time and all the rest has been demolished

5229705 we had 250 german war prisoners underneath they were down underground at fort hunt
5229706 up on this far end was the two taller buildings one of them being the one we billeted in
5229707 well thats what we were hoping you would tell us
5229708 we actually have from veterans a photograph of on the day after the war ended hundreds of documents being burned at 1142
5229709 and it illustrates how critical it is to speak to these gentlemen because who knows what part of the story went up in smoke
5229710 rats cats dogs fortune tellers cripples blind men whores salesmen rent collectors and children
5229711 smoke obscured the vision and cinders drifted into the house into our beds into our kitchens into our food and a tarlike smell was always in the air
5229712 i really didnt want to read it i maybe would have preferred a mystery
5229713 then i went into the kitchen and took some chocolate caramels and went to bed with black boy and the chocolate caramels
5229714 when i got to the end of chapter 2 and i read that he only had an orange for christmas and that he sucked it slowly to make it last i spit the caramels out
5229715 you would be surprised at how many students dont know who richard wright is

5229723 i was sleeping like a log i was dreaming i was coaching a rookie to direct traffic
5229724 traffic i bet it was flowing north and south ha ha
5229725 why in gods name is she calling you at this hour
5229726 its her duty honey i got to go in at the commissioners at two
5229727 well i never youre a captain they shouldnt rouse you out of your sleep like that
5229728 she said i was not to come in in uniform
5229729 now agnes dont you be a little kitten and start scratching at mary jane shes not trying to lure me out of the house for her sake

5229739 we did make mistakes in the team finals and china deserved that gold but it shows that we do have more to give and we just kind of came back today and showed the world that we are the strong usa team that weve been saying we were
5229740 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
5229741 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
5229742 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
5229743 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
5229744 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
5229745 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
5229746 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything
5229747 and it is certainly worth considering an entry though you have missed the latest of these now semi annual events which closed on june 17 and you can see the

5229751 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5229752 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5229753 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5229754 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5229755 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5229756 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products
5229757 i made up my mind not to come to you again to make you sad for if i were to make you sad who would be left to cheer me up only the very persons i have made sad my purpose was not to make you sad but to make you realize how much i love you all
5229758 you should forgive the wrongdoer and encourage him in order to keep him from becoming so sad as to give up completely

5229784 charles 1 of england was willing to promote civil war to uphold the divine right of kings
5229785 they preferred the ancient light of divinely blessed authority to the distant glimmer of democracy

5229800 we enter that sphere of christian knowledge in which we have to do with the heart of the message received by and laid upon the christian community
5229801 god loved the world and reconciled it with himself in christ
5229802 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
5229803 once you were alienated from god and were enemies in your minds because of reconciliation involves a change in the relationship of people who were previously enemies
5229804 all this is done by god who through christ changed us from enemies into his friends and gave us the task of making others his friends also
5229805 therefore since we have been justified through faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ
5229806 but god proves his love for us in that while we still were sinners christ died for us
5229807 by christs death in his physical body god has reconciled you to himself
5229808 for in him god in all his fullness chose to dwell and through him to reconcile all things to himself
5229809 the cross is the giving up of gods self in order not to give up on humanity it is the consequence of gods desire to break the power of human enmity without violence and receive human beings into divine communion the arms of the crucified are open a sign of a space in gods self and an invitation for the enemy to come in
5229810 whoever thinks the cross is not an offense has never followed the crucified to gethsemane let alone to golgotha if the fate of the crucified and his demand to walk in his footsteps disturb us then we will also be disturbed by the god of the crucified for the very nature of the triune god is reflected on the cross of christ at the core of christian faith lies the claim that god entered history and died on the cross in the person of jesus christ for an unjust and deceitful world
5229811 in jesus god does not die a natural death but rather the violent death of a condemned person on the cross at golgotha he dies the death of complete god abandonedness the suffering in the suffering of jesus is the abandonment and indeed condemnation by the god whom he called father the god abandoned son of god takes the eternal death of the abandoned and the damned upon himself in order to become god of the abandoned and brother of the damned every person damned and abandoned by god can in the crucified one experience community with god the incarnate god is present and accessible to the humanity of every person
5229812 gods love expressed through jesus christ has indeed conquered the great divide of sin that so irreversibly separated us from god
5229813 here under the cross rather is where the godless are justified enemies are reconciled prisoners are set free the poor are enriched and the sad are filled with hope
5229814 everyone who calls on the name of the lord shall be saved
5229815 for i am convinced that neither death nor life neither angels nor demons neither the present nor the future nor any powers neither height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of god that is in christ jesus our lord
5229816 there is neither jew nor greek slave nor free male nor female for you are all one in christ jesus
5229817 i ask not only on behalf of these but also on behalf of those who will believe in me through their word

5229838 it was constant troubleshooting testing research posting to the google apps forums and so on plus theres the emotional strain of wondering whether you completely screwed up by moving everyone to google apps as our sole e mail system thats what freaked me out did google just make me look like an idiot

5229904 my loyalty is to the democrats winning barack obama is going to have a serious problem getting elected for good reason the party needs to face the fact that without hillary clinton on the ticket the democrats will probably lose
5229905 there is a sense of entitlement that almost seems to be inbred
5229906 they are convinced hillary is the one who should be assuming the mantle and its tough to crack that
5229907 unfortunately we couldnt get it in to the stage set up

5229919 the study demonstrates and confirms an increased frequency of rejection reactions among patients who test positive with xm one r even in cases where conventional lymphocyte cross match tests are unsuccessful in detecting donor specific antibodies prior to now we have not been able to be sure that we could detect these important non hla anti bodies
5229920 the study shows that we now with xm one easily can get access to donor cells that allow detection of non hla anti bodies this in turn improves donor recipient pairing and kidney transplantation outcome
5229921 the study is a first step in building up a scientific knowledge base about and clinical acceptance of xm one r the work has awakened great scientific interest and several other transplantation centers want to conduct their own independent trials with xm one r
5229922 xm one r provides key previously unattainable information about donor recipient compatibility that increases the probability of a successful transplantation xm one r opens up completely new possibilities for detecting antibodies that we previously were unable to identify
5229923 using xm one r we can now identify the extent of clinical problems related to anti endothelium cell antibodies in patients undergoing transplantations

5229925 our findings show ssws lives are dominated by an unrelenting cycle of selling sex buying drugs and then using them
5229926 this suggests they are unlikely to be able to just stop working even if the risks of punishment are increased street sex markets and the ssws poor health are the product of complex and interrelated factors and if anything these approaches will make ssws wary of contact with the police and push the women underground making them more vulnerable to violence and difficult for support services to reach
5229927 our research indicates that improvement of drug services would reduce the need to score and use drugs which is likely to reduce time spent working as well as contact with drug dealers and other users if this was linked to addressing accommodation needs and supporting contact with children then the majority of pressures forcing the women back into the cycle would also be addressed

5229936 our study reveals potentially clinically relevant differences in the gene expression of different cancer types and represents a reference framework for interpretation of smaller scale functional studies
5229937 this segregation of tumors into three groups with distinct expression patterns is surprising clearly the developmental trajectory provides a meaningful background for capturing large scale differences in gene expression across diverse conditions
5229938 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimise for those properties
5229939 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5229940 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution
5229941 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa

5229943 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are uphappy with their lot
5229944 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits
5229945 and really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan

5229955 snoring can ruin lives for some the hairdryer treatment of a boot camp is the only option
5229956 as part of any agreement to take part in the camp our sergeant major will inspect each guests bags for contraband items such as alcohol or cigarettes both of which can make snoring worse
5229957 the aim is to provide as much advice and information as possible to the selected snorers and their families helping them to reduce or stop the problem altogether its going to be tough but the results will be worth it
5229958 there is no one reason in particular why people snore we will look at each case individually this is not a trivial problem the spouses of some snorers are at their wits end
5229959 the problem might not have been solved by the end of the weekend but the boot camp is a springboard to success the participants will learn lessons they will take away
5229960 this land was in bad condition it was barren and full of stones first i made drains and removed the stones making it better i filled the drains i planted trees with the main objective that i could use them to earn my living but the government banned cutting of trees the trees keeps multiplying
5229961 when i planted trees people called me a mad person i cannot keep the count of saplings i have planted here but i can say there are over three lakhs trees here this year alone ive already planted 300 saplings
5229962 he should be given recognition in the country inspite of being illiterate that from such a small pond he is tending his trees and plants in his 8 acres of land he never runs out of food to provide water to his plants he dug small drains so that water can flow to the plants through them we and the administration look up to him as he has great personality and doing a good job by planting saplings here
5229963 im helpless i earn just rs 10 to 15 a day the government has not taken a look at us ive given my blood taken bullets and endured cane lashings during protests i even went to jail but theyve not done anything to me i request the government to at least provide us two square meals a day
5229964 if we dont have a rickshaw we cannot survive we had a rickshaw but it was stolen and this rickshaw is on rental basis somehow we are managing if we had our own house we wouldnt have stayed in such a bad condition the government has not helped us in anyway he sundi has given his blood for the country but got nothing in return
5229965 im not aware of the matter if i was aware that he was a freedom fighter and that he is troubled i would have been happy to help him ill make sure that he receives his cash pension immediately i will pursue the matter now that ive come to know from this medium about it i will talk with the district magistrate district collector and sdo to hasten his case if theres anything else left pending i will make sure that its done properly and at the earliest possible time

5229984 we think we have about six to eight months ahead of us getting a construction certificate issued then it will take a year to build the thing because of its size
5229985 its pretty big when you stand here and look at the area the building will take up
5229986 those inefficiencies result in extra costs that we cant pass on to customers so it eats directly into our profits
5229987 the inclusion of a cr che is also important because we have highly skilled young females in our workforce who are going to get married and have children and we want them to continue to come to work for us

5229995 stop grumbling as the icc and its member boards will not buckle to any pressure from players associations
5229996 the icc and its member boards are fully satisfied with the security arrangements and have approved the plans we have in place for the event
5229997 we have done everything possible to make security arrangements foolproof even tim may the representative of the international players federation has acknowledged our security plan is the best ever
5229998 only some of these players are grumbling and i dont think the concerns they have about the security in pakistan is based on sense reasoning or logic
5229999 it is an emotive reaction and i see it as emotional pressure being put on the icc and us but there is no way the icc or boards will accept this and the tournament will be held in pakistan as scheduled
