7990041 american businesses and consumers were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7990042 the overall mood is still one of caution theres not much out there to get investors excited

7990046 with all the obamamentum and all of the media attention and all of the charisma that he is said to have how do you explain this contraction in the polls from 15 points now to a dead heat even in the big states

7990065 we launched this initiative because pizza has become more and more expensive vis a vis the general surge in food prices and we want to help consumers and their families make ends meet each month

7990071 experienced an in flight depressurisation incident which caused the oxygen masks on board to deploy
7990072 as a safety precaution the captain descended and diverted the aircraft to limoges airport
7990073 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
7990074 i would say some people thought we were going to die
7990075 for about half an hour no one told us anything we didnt know what was happening at all we were quite panicky
7990076 after half an hour we were told to take the oxygen mask off and then the plane landed and we were fine
7990077 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
7990078 they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
7990079 as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8000 feet where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off that they were diverting to limoges
7990080 the irish and french aviation authorities have been notified of this incident and a full investigation of this incident will be undertaken later today

7990100 its correct that we were basically miming to a pre recording
7990101 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
7990102 pales in comparison to the honor ive had representing you
7990103 you havent heard about iraq or john mccain or george w bush
7990104 if theres a model for the convention that barack obama is running this year its the 1992 gathering overseen by well carville
7990105 pales in comparison to the honor ive had representing you
7990106 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7990107 his reps called and said wed love for you to sing the anthem on thursday
7990108 its very complex the city owns numerous properties citywide and in some areas outside of the city
7990109 we are going through all of those properties and developing a legally defensible rule
7990110 its not like were picking at seattle but i think we would have numerous jurisdictions having numerous different rules and it would create great confusion
7990111 i told them that i was committed to new york city opera and signed my contract
7990112 nobody knows at the moment what will happen anyway with their six week season plus rehearsals period the bayreuth festival should not affect my work for nyco on the contrary it could reinforce the international stature of city opera
7990113 no are they voting for john mccain you know if john mccain selects a woman vice president we have a problem because joe biden didnt bring in 18 million votes he didnt bring anything
7990114 what george bush did to the country the dnc did to 18 million people

7990119 i think the dsccs ads are definitely having an impact on the race
7990120 when an outside group comes in and spends millions of dollars its got to affect the race somehow
7990121 i think the polls a bunch of junk for many reasons
7990122 our ads confirm what people already know about elizabeth dole
7990123 they dont see much of dole and they dont know what shes done
7990124 i have to make sure that claims made by one branch of government do not violate the powers of the other two branches
7990125 due to the specific issues involved in this case we would not be able to raise defenses that could conflict with the powers of my other two clients the legislative and judicial branches
7990126 neither the legislative nor judicial branches are parties to the lawsuit so it is absurd for jim hood to suggest some sort of conflict as his reason for begging off the case
7990127 good lawyers do not turn their backs on their clients at the last minute but this is not the first time attorney general hood has done so since ive been governor it is a shame the taxpayers of mississippi will have to pay extra to be represented because jim hood has changed his mind again about who he represents
7990128 what were actually challenging is the governors authority to artificially raise taxes on hospitals and call those taxes legal based on judge singletarys ruling
7990129 his record of being wrong on foreign policy is as long as his record on foreign policy

7990135 my wife just went through a totally rude customer service experience with our local uhaul rep downright rude do they want the business
7990136 ive learned never to use uhaul they screwed up my move and offered me a 5 gift certificate
7990137 uhaul has quite the reputation poor customer service is almost an art form link to consumerist posts on uhaul
7990138 in my experience uhaul has some of the worst customer service i have ever experienced they dont care
7990139 uhaul hands down has the worst customer service i have ever dealt with in my life phone and face to face
7990140 thousands of horror stories about them im lucky my local uhaul is great
7990141 just back from maddening trip to uhaul to get our money back for failed hitch install contemplating my options
7990142 my guess is many consumers arent aware of other choices and suffer through uhaul anyways
7990143 maybe they arent getting any organizational support and feel frustrated

7990152 i wrote the book in the hopes that children will get better lives
7990153 i want to see more integration and the responsibility for that lies with the somalians themselves and with the authorities
7990154 im tired of being patient with a situation where children arent getting enough food at home where women are beaten by their husbands where welfare payments to the somalian families are used by the men to buy the narcotic khat where the willingness to simply obtain more welfare money is stronger than the ability to care for children
7990155 half of the somalians in norway have been here less than five years have little education and have problems integrating
7990156 if i could somehow snap my fingers and cut off the funding from one country it would be saudi arabia
7990157 a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and allahs religion is made victorious over all other religions

7990164 it has become harder and harder to grow our circulation over the past three years since windows mobile changed from being pdas to being phones pocket pc manufacturers like hp used to work with us to offer their customers a free issue of our magazine in their packaging the phone companies have not shown similar interest in working with us the other business challenge has been the lack of advertising sponsorship from microsoft phone companies and oems despite our coverage of their products in order for us to sell subscriptions at current low consumer magazine type prices we must have a stronger and growing circulation and we much attract the large advertisers who benefit the most from our existence
7990165 its probably a little worse now given electronic media and the bloggers and all these kinds of things
7990166 we take this issue extremely seriously and are working to resolve this regrettable loss with graphic data as a matter of urgency

7990172 thank you for mentioning that said mccain who will turn 72 on friday and is likely to roll out the name of his presidential running mate that day to take some of the steam out of barack obamas convention closer on thursday
7990173 wouldnt it be good to have a person you dont know what party theyre with they have no political principles whatsoever they may need a job about that time said mccain pointedly suggesting that his pick could be the soon to be free agent seated next to him
7990174 the approval rating for congress is now down to nine percent thats blood relatives and paid staffers mccain said reeling out a standard one liner

7990236 richard brings twenty five years of global automotive experience to think which will help us greatly in growing the company quickly and increasing our international presence his extensive background at ford in both strategy and operations will be ideal to help guide think as we grow together with the two new swedish automotive managers the new team has together 66 years of experience working in ford volvo saab and vw think is well placed as we move to larger volume production
7990237 the electrification of the automobile industry has reached a tipping point think is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this trend and is the leader in this rapidly growing industry sector my view is that think is where the future of the automotive industry will be
7990238 this is an important step forward in growing the company

7990240 the law is extremely protective of any rescue personnel they have various immunities that makes cases against them based on negligence almost impossible
7990241 on the other hand this was clearly a botched rescue things should have been done differently
7990242 there are many issues involved i think accountability is the critical part from our perspective
7990243 the link between nonmelanoma skin cancer and increased risk for many different types of cancer may provide valuable clues to advance what we know about the causes of cancer
7990244 right now we do not understand why this link is present but it suggests that skin cancer may be a marker for a characteristic likely a genetic characteristic that increases overall susceptibility to cancer this certainly makes nmsc seem to be a more important part of ones personal health history than we previously thought
7990245 in conclusion our results suggest that nut corn and popcorn consumption is not associated with an increased risk of incident diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding and may be protective for the former these findings refute the pervasive but unproven belief that these foods are associated with diverticular complications and suggest that the recommendation to avoid these foods in diverticular disease should be reconsidered
7990246 however since 1978 more than 80 cases of lead poisoning associated with ayurvedic medicine use have been reported worldwide
7990247 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits
7990248 a 2005 institute of medicine report concluded that the regulatory mechanisms for monitoring the safety of dietary supplements should be revised the constraints imposed on fda u s food and drug administration with regard to ensuring the absence of unreasonable risk associated with the use of dietary supplements make it difficult for the health of the american public to be adequately protected
7990249 new fda regulations and current indian policies do not specify any maximum acceptable concentrations or daily dose limits for metals in dietary supplements for domestic use we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
7990250 the legislature acted within its constitutional authority in protecting the right of a worker with a concealed carry permit a statutory right to have a gun secured in a vehicle in a parking lot by prohibiting a business from asking such a worker whether he or she has a gun in a vehicle in a parking lot taking action against such a worker based on a statement about whether the worker has a gun in a vehicle in a parking lot for lawful purposes searching such a workers vehicle for a gun conditioning employment on whether a worker has a concealed carry permit or terminating or otherwise discriminating against a worker with a concealed carry permit for having a gun in a vehicle in a parking lot
7990251 because few interventions in critically ill adult patients reduce mortality to this extent the results of this trial were enthusiastically received and rapidly incorporated into guidelines
7990252 these recommendations have led to worldwide adoption of tight glucose control in a variety of intensive care unit icu settings
7990253 given the overall findings of this meta analysis it seems appropriate that the guidelines recommending tight glucose control in all critically ill patients should be re evaluated until the results of larger more definitive clinical trials are available
7990254 possible explanations for the discordant results of the study by van den berghe et al and the meta analysis by wiener et al are that the meta analysis is flawed the studies that form the basis of the meta analysis are flawed or inherently different or the findings of the study by van den berghe et al occurred due to random chance or as a result of another unique factor interacting with tight glycemic control
7990255 those investigating tight glycemic control should take a step back and address the fundamental questions of defining quality standards for tight glycemic control finding affordable methods of frequent and highly accurate measurement of blood glucose in the icu and conduct multicenter efficacy studies to determine if tighter glycemic control can reduce mortality under optimal conditions if tighter glycemic control can be proven effective in optimal conditions determining how to make that benefit available to millions of critically ill patients in both developed and resource poor countries around the world would be a truly worthwhile challenge there is no simple or clear answer to the complex problem of glycemic control in critically ill adults at present targeting tight glycemic control cannot be said to be either right or wrong
7990256 the results of this study represent a potentially new therapeutic approach that of control of a biochemical cause of hypertension rather than nonspecifically lowering elevated bp although not representing a fully developed therapeutic strategy this study raises an alternative strategy that may prove to be more effective than currently available options
7990257 despite these findings this clinical trial is a small one and allopurinol is not indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adolescents or other populations the potential adverse effects of allopurinol including gastrointestinal complaints and especially stevens johnson syndrome a severe allergic reaction make allopurinol an unattractive alternative to available antihypertensive medications more clinical trials are needed to determine the reproducibility of the data and whether it can be generalized to the larger hypertensive population nevertheless the observation that lowering uric acid can reduce bp in adolescents with newly diagnosed hypertension raises intriguing questions about its role in the pathogenesis of hypertension
7990258 the plunge in ifo business confidence in august has raised the risk that right after the ecb rate hike in july germany may be falling into recession instead

7990265 i would say some people thought we were going to die the woman sitting in the seat in front of us was whimpering
7990266 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear we really didnt see them during the main situation at all they didnt say anything they werent visible
7990267 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
7990268 i was scared i think everyone was scared ive got three kids and my wife on the flight and i just sat there helplessly thinking it might be the end
7990269 i would say the crew didnt know what to do they didnt inform us for about 20 minutes which i think was wrong a little information would have calmed everyone down
7990270 my wifes oxygen bag inflated and so did my sons mine stayed flat all around me people kept tugging and saying its not working properly
7990271 the first thing we do in these situations is take the safety first option we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
7990272 they usually inflate when passengers exhale its a trickle of pure oxygen you dont feel a rush of gas all its doing is enriching the low pressure air
7990273 the pilot is having to navigate having to communicate with air traffic control and having to avoid hitting other aeroplanes his priority is to keep the aeroplane safe
7990274 they satisfy every single safety level but it is the minimum

7990281 i think nokia needs something more distinctive going forward truly new products rather than devices that look like a refresh of previous products on a slightly different form factor
7990282 we intervene in the hardware stream and say how about a virtual network and that is starting to ramp up
7990283 we started to buy commercial suites like xensource now owned by citrix or vmware but we always hated their licensing programs and the way they tried to limit growth so we wound up back at xen org
7990284 we pitch the idea that were pragmatic rather than the latest and greatest we know how to operate a cloud really effectively by using tried and true tools and one of them is xen we showcase that were involved in the project and they would much rather have their applications in a stable environment than a supercharged always failing environment
7990285 we were into coldfusion and j j allaire adopted linux early weve developed on top of linux ever since
7990286 i find myself always gravitating to the gnu type projects they are the best way to develop venture backed applications with the amount of creativity coming out of the community and the value right out of the box you realize a real benefit by always using foss
7990287 the other day i was looking around the office and realized we use a lot of linux applications
7990288 we didnt set out to build the company on linux but we wound up doing that because everything just fits we use
7990289 we still have to use exchange but were about to move over to an exchange knockoff with a great feature set called kerio
7990290 i was like any business owner but we have to buy so many support contracts for clients servers hardware and you start to realize theyre not really interested in supporting you it used to be dell had this four hour support contract and it was easy to get them to do the work as time has gone on they have changed that we went to dell the other day and they wanted us to troubleshoot you have to go through all the troubleshooting before they will dispatch a part the more i see that the more i say i would rather rely on the community discussion boards its all right there and i can just get it rather than having to social engineer my way through tier one support
7990291 but we do get to see the net effect of all the software as it is running on diverse systems and we contribute back support we keep an active wiki and dump chunks of it back into the community to help the discussion sugar rolled out a revision recently and we saw the broken parts within minutes we let people know and many people avoided upgrading to that release were not stellar code contributors but we do play a role
7990292 the principal flexibility of open source is unlocked by being able to leverage many php or java developers to produce your vision
7990293 with a network company the advantage of open source is even clearer if you have a programmer you can string together an entire systems desk by using open source connectors that work together and that looks like a large network management company the advantage is i get the same efficiency as a enterprise grade product at much lower expense

7990308 the court will deny the executives request for a stay
7990309 hence the executive should respond to the document aspect of the subpoenas by producing non privileged material and identifying more specifically the materials it is withholding on a claim of executive privilege
7990310 it is on ms mierss appearance that the dispute principally focuses this decision should not however foreclose the parties continuing attempts to reach a negotiated solution both sides indicated that discussions regarding an accommodation have resumed
7990311 toward that end and hopefully as a prelude to meaningful discussions between us i propose that members of our respective staffs meet as early as next week to re commence discussing possibilities for reaching an accommodation between the branches in this matter
7990312 as i know you appreciate this litigation is very important in determining constitutional contours governing certain relations between the executive and legislative branches in the congressional oversight setting
7990313 accordingly the department of justice has now filed an appeal in this matter and is also seeking a stay of the decision pending review by the u s court of appeals for the d c circuit
7990314 that course of action will provide appellate consideration of the novel questions at stake in this matter and will enable the parties to obtain if it should prove necessary a final decision in this important matter however the fact that the executive has notice an appeal in this matter does not signify that we think further litigation is the exclusive path forward
7990315 represents the best hope of promoting an accommodation between the two branches
7990316 had the litigants indicated that a negotiated solution was foreseeable in the near future the court may have stayed its hand in the hope that further intervention in this dispute by the article iii branch would not be necessary
7990317 as it stands however the court must decide the questions presented to it but there is still ample time for the parties to reach an accommodation the courts july 31 2008 order does not compel ms miers to appear at any particular date
7990318 todays ruling clearly rejects the white houses efforts to run out the clock on the committees investigation of doj politicization this congress
7990319 i am heartened that judge bates recognized that the public interest in this matter is best served by the furtherance of the committees investigation the committee intends to promptly schedule a hearing with ms miers and stands ready as always to consider any reasonable offer of accommodation with the white house
7990320 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context
7990321 in fact there is supreme court authority that is all but conclusive on this question and that powerfully suggests that such advisors do not enjoy absolute immunity the court therefore rejects the executives claim of absolute immunity for senior presidential aides
7990322 the aspect of this lawsuit that is unprecedented is the notion that ms miers is absolutely immune from compelled congressional process the supreme court has reserved absolute immunity for very narrow circumstances involving the presidents personal exposure to suits for money damages based on his official conduct or concerning matters of national security or foreign affairs the executives current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law

7990329 i venture to suggest that philosophers tend on the whole to be persons of considerable intelligence many of them highly competent at science and endowed with excellent thinking skills its not that if you let some real scientists loose on philosophical problems they would have all the answers for you in a matter of days in fact when scientists particularly distinguished ones try their hand at philosophy usually after they have retired the results are often quite inept risibly so so what is it that makes philosophy so hard why do we still have no proof that there is an external world or that there are minds other than our own why is freedom of the will still so hotly debated why do we have so much trouble figuring out what kind of thing the self is why is the relation between consciousness and the brain so exasperatingly hard to pin down
7990330 perhaps then that is the explanation of philosophical intractability more broadly philosophical problems are of a kind that does not suit the particular way we form knowledge of the world the question then is what it is about the problems and our intelligence that makes the latter unsuited to the former
7990331 the central conjecture of my book is that there is a certain cognitive structure that shapes our knowledge of the world and that this structure is inappropriate when it comes to key philosophical problems i call this the calm conjecture short for combinatorial atomism with lawlike mappings roughly speaking you understand something when you know what parts it has and how they are put together as well as how the whole changes over time then you have rendered the phenomenon in question calm
7990332 natural entities are basically complex systems of interacting parts that evolve over time as a result of various causal influences this is obviously true of inanimate physical objects which are spatial complexes made of molecules and atoms and quarks and subject to the physical forces of nature but it is also true of biological organisms in which now the parts include kidneys hearts lungs and the cells that compose these the same abstract architecture applies to language also sentences are complexes of simpler elements words and phrases put together according to grammatical rules mathematical entities such as triangles equations and numbers are also complexes decomposable into simpler elements in all these cases we can appropriately bring to bear the calm method of thinking we conceptualize the entities in question by resolving them into parts and articulating their mode of arrangement
7990333 find the atoms and the laws of combination and evolution and then derive the myriad of complex objects you find in nature if incomprehension is a state of anxiety or chaos then calm is what brings calm question does calm work in philosophy
7990334 in problems in philosophy i argue that t here are yawning gaps between some phenomena and the more basic phenomena they proceed from so that we cannot apply the calm format to bring sense to what we observe the essence of a philosophical problem is the unexplained leap the step from one thing to another without any conception of the bridge that supports the step for example a free decision involves a transition from a set of beliefs and desires to a particular choice but this choice is not dictated by what precedes it hence it seems like an unmediated leap the choice that is cannot be accounted for simply in terms of the beliefs and desires that form the input to it just as conscious states cannot be accounted for in terms of the neural processes they emanate from in both cases we seem to be presented with something radically novel issuing from nowhere as if a new act of creation were necessary to bring it into being and this is the mark of our lack of understanding the existence of animal life seems like an eruption from nowhere or an act of god until we understand the process of evolution by natural selection we can then begin to see how the transitions operate from the simple to the more complex but in philosophy we typically lack the right kind of explanatory theory and hence find ourselves deeply puzzled by how the world is working
7990335 this message is not very congenial to the optimistic philosopher who wants to solve the deep problems that brought him or her to philosophy
7990336 i think the question is not proper whether the will be free but whether a man be free
7990337 this way of talking nevertheless has prevailed and as i guess produced great confusion
7990338 at the first session ayer asked who had read the book to be discussed
7990339 the session continued with ayer giving the first presentation of the term followed by what seemed to me like a very high powered discussion to which i did not even think of making a contribution
7990340 the man at the back can pay for his virtue and give the presentation on chapter two for next week
7990341 i duly found myself in front of about forty clever people ready to find fault with whatever i had to say
7990342 in order to improve my chances on the b phil i decided to enter for a voluntary examination called the john locke prize this examination is for people aiming to win the prize of one hundred and fifty pounds along with the prestige that goes with it traditionally the brightest philosophy postgraduate at oxford wins the prize the examiners that year 1972 for the john locke prize were professor ayer professor hare who had let me onto the b phil and brian farrell the wilde reader in mental philosophy a fairly formidable crew
7990343 about a week later professor ayer informed me that my handwriting was so bad that i would need to have my papers typed by a professional typist in the presence of an invigilator to make sure i hadnt cheated
7990344 then a week or so later as i was sitting down for one of kripkes john locke lectures professor ayer conspicuously approached me in front of about five hundred people clapped me on the back and told me i had won the john locke prize and by a wide margin
7990345 i wonder now what would have happened to me if ayer had never asked me to have my papers typed a highly unusual step in fact or if i had walked out when i felt like it or if i had just not sat for the john locke prize at all things would undoubtedly have been very different and even now i feel a cold sweat at the alternative possibilities life and chance chance and life

7990392 a municipal ordinance that makes it unlawful to interrupt a police officer in the performance of his duty is substantially overbroad and therefore invalid on its face under the first amendment the ordinance in question criminalizes a substantial amount of and is susceptible of regular application to constitutionally protected speech and accords the police unconstitutional enforcement discretion as is demonstrated by evidence indicating that although the ordinances plain language is violated scores of times daily only those individuals chosen by police in their unguided discretion are arrested
7990393 although the preservation of liberty depends in part upon the maintenance of social order the first amendment requires that officers and municipalities respond with restraint in the face of verbal challenges to police action since a certain amount of expressive disorder is inevitable in a society committed to individual freedom and must be protected if that freedom would survive

7990401 where there are permanent taliban settlements and where organized crime groups profit from the instability
7990402 this is a remarkable accomplishment the first time it happens in the countrys modern history
7990403 more than half of afghanistan provinces are now poppy free
7990404 the gains in the north and east show that counternarctocis efforts can succeed
7990405 until they all face the full force of the law the opium economy will continue to prosper with impunity and the taliban will continue to profit from it
7990406 im sure theres going to be a rather difficult period in our discussions
7990407 if it goes in the direction of aggravating relations its not going to be our choice but i want to remind you that cold war was a completely different beast when we were really at each others throats in a big way internationally and this is not going to happen under any circumstances
7990408 their use of force against south ossetia clearly dashed all of those previous resolutions and created a completely new reality
7990409 after 20 minutes the pilot called nyala airport to tell him the plane had been hijacked and that he is en route to tripoli in libya
7990410 the passengers are inside the plane so far i dont know the exact number of hijackers dialogue is underway between the hijackers and the libyan authorities
7990411 i am worried about my father and mother they are coming from nyala on this flight no one has any information
7990412 this is the result of what the government is doing in the camps of displaced people in nyala
7990413 the attached print ad part of a series of similar ads run by glaxosmithkline is the most egregious example of this type of advertising this ad is designed to instill fear in the minds of aids patients by telling them that switching aids treatment presumably from gsk drugs may lead to increased side effects and potentially treatment failure this message is gsks response to the increased number of patients switching from its drugs to newer treatments and seeks to discourage aids patients from changing their antiretroviral arv regimens regardless of their medical needs further the explicit message in this ad avoid hidden dangers from switching your hiv medicine is that safety and efficacy information provided by a patients doctor or the fda is incorrect or misleading
7990414 the ads are part of a larger trend of drug companies taking aim at rival hiv drugs hinting at side effects and other drawbacks experts say
7990415 a development fueling the sharp elbows advertising the market for hiv medicines has grown crowded and companies want to protect their market share
7990416 can be deceiving avoid hidden dangers from changing your hiv medicines
7990417 if you are thinking about switching your hiv medicine make sure you know what youre getting into
7990418 with these latest ads gsk has sunk to a new low the company has resorted to exploiting patient fears in order to sell a product while remaining unconcerned about the harm caused to patients who are scared off treatment altogether because of gsks tactics
7990419 we are disappointed that poz magazine a publication targeted to an hiv positive population would run such ads this kind of underhanded negative advertising creates fear of hiv treatment in general which could dissuade people from seeking treatment at all we are also disappointed that despite repeated communication with the fda regarding our concerns over a similar gsk ad campaign last year there appears to be a total lack of oversight of direct to consumer advertising of prescription drugs that is why we are appealing to hhs in the hopes that our concerns will be heard and these harmful ads pulled
7990420 unfortunately gsks advertising tactics only serve to amplify fears and doubts patients may already have about antiretroviral therapy making it harder for doctors to treat them
7990421 it is important for patients and their providers to work together to make treatment decisions independent of drug industry advertising that might compromise the doctor patient relationship and potentially the health of the patient
7990422 father you said in isaiah 53 that by your stripes i am healed
7990423 father thank you for your promise to provide all my needs according to your riches in glory
7990424 io vorrei essere luomo che attendi con trepidazione nel letto prima che egli giunga e si corichi accanto a te vorrei dopo lamore sentire le tue braccia che mi stringono il tuo corpo che mi scalda il freddo mi assale quando lascio il tuo grembo e tu ti volgi dallaltra parte per prendere sonno ho freddo ros
7990425 e il freddo che prende gli uomini che temono di morire
7990426 tu non hai paura di morire ti ho visto molte volte batterti come se la vita non avesse per te alcun valore c un dolore dentro di te che non riesci a vincere una ferita che non guarisce era dunque cosi splendida la tua regina cos bello il suo seno e il suo grembo cos ardente io mi volgo dallaltra parte perch a lei che pensi lei che sogni nella notte e vicino a lei che vorresti svegliarti dimentica argo e dimentica lei se vuoi conquistare questa terra e incominciare unaltra vita dimentica ci che stato altrimenti perderai tutto i tuoi compagni questa terra me stessa se di me ti importa le tue notti si faranno sempre pi fredde finch un giorno avrai terrore di addormentarti di chiudere gli occhi
7990427 sei solo un ragazzo avresti diritto a pensieri diversi oh dei perch perch a noi che non abbiamo fatto nulla
7990428 non chiedere sorella non c risposta alle tue domande il destino cieco e ha gettato su di noi tutte le sventure nello stesso momento qualcun altro altrove lontano gode di tutte le gioie anche delle nostre di quelle a cui avremmo diritto ma un giorno chiss forse anche per noi sorgeranno giorni pi sereni forse potremo vivere e dimenticare
7990429 ma ora conviene fare ci che dovuto non piangere mentre me ne vado
7990430 non ho mai conosciuto una guerra che non fosse maledetta che non portasse lutti e dolori senza fine
7990431 questa la guerra che loro hanno conosciuto hanno visto che i vincitori hanno sofferto come o pi dei vinti con che animo si appresterebbero a un altro scontro con la stessa gente no rispondi ai lats che non scender in guerra al loro fianco d se vuoi che abbiamo gi combattuto una lunga guerra che ci ha portato ogni sorta di disgrazie con enea mi batter da solo se vincer tornerai da loro e tratterai nuove condizioni da una posizione di forza forse questa bella pianura presto sar nostra forse vicino il giorno in cui costruir la mia citt
7990432 questa terra ti ha molto cambiato da quando ti ho conosciuto e dura e primitiva e non perdona nulla per questo hai perso un po per volta il tuo mondo lo hai perduto a pezzi per la strada nelle paludi sui monti nelle valli e nelle foreste assieme ai tuoi compagni caduti assieme ai tuoi cavalli immortali uccisi e mangiati dai lupi forse presto saresti stato del tutto nudo non pi un re non pi un eroe solo un uomo come me
7990433 non lo so ma certo sarebbe la verit la tua quando uno ha di fronte la verit sa cosa fare se gli piace continua per quella strada se non gli piace si uccide ma ora questo enea ha rovinato tutto ti ha riportato indietro ha fatto rinascere i vecchi fantasmi ora ti illudi di nuovo che nulla sia cambiato ti accingi a un duello come se fossi ancora sotto le mura di ilio anche se vincerai non cambier nulla questo paese fatto di cento popoli venuti qui da chiss dove parlano tante lingue diverse
7990434 mancano solo quattro giorni alla luna nuova dove sono le mie armi il giorno del duello dovranno splendere come quando uscirono dalle mani dellartefice
7990435 risplenderanno wanax risplenderanno come il sole a mezzogiorno e tu apparirai tremendo e invincibile come quando una dea guidava il tuo carro contro il dio della guerra davanti alle porte scee

7990438 a general lowering of moral standards throughout society a rise in infidelity a lessening of respect for women by men and the coercive use of reproductive technologies by governments
7990439 less than half a century later these preoccupations with overwhelming birth rates appear as pseudo scientific as phrenology
7990440 temporary sterilants to water supplies or staple food doses of the antidote would be carefully rationed by the government to produce the desired population size
7990441 women who were willing to get an abortion or who reliably used contraception no longer found it necessary to condition sexual relations on a promise of marriage in the event of pregnancy
7990442 these women feared correctly that if they refused sexual relations they would risk losing their partners
7990443 sexual activity without commitment was increasingly expected in premarital relationships
7990444 many men reasoned that they were not to blame for unwanted births after all women had access to contraceptives and to abortions if women choose not to avail themselves of contraceptives or abortions they should bear the consequences of that choice
7990445 contraception has released males to a historically unprecedented degree from responsibility for their sexual aggression
7990446 over 90 percent of the women and 75 percent of the men in every cohort report fidelity within their marriage over its entirety
7990447 from the 1970s to the 1990s rates of marital dissolution fell by almost half among 4 year college graduates but remained relatively high and steady among women with less than a 4 year college degree
7990448 the long term outcome of divorce for the majority of children is resiliency rather than dysfunction
7990449 twenty five percent of youths from divorced families in comparison to ten percent from non divorced families did have serious social emotional and psychological problems
7990450 a commentary on genesis declared contraception to be worse than incest or adultery
7990451 girls begin to talk and stand on their own sooner than boys because weeds always grow up more quickly than good crops

7990758 auch wenn es sie nat rlich gibt sind wikihoster eher die ausnahme u im gegensatz zu webloghostern der standard ist eigentlich ein wiki auf gemietetem webspace f r diesen zweck gibt es viele wiki tools vom eher u einfachen dokuwiki12 bis hin zum mediawiki13 dem tanker unter den wikis mit dem auch die wikipedia betrieben wird aber wikis sind nicht nur f r das kollaborative arbeiten geeignet sie u k nnen auch den zettelkasten ersetzen und mutieren dann zu einem persoo nal information management werkzeug pim neben reinen desktop wikis kann man aber auch jedes andere wiki auf dem desktop installieren und un11 12 de wikipedia org www splitbrain org projects dokuwiki 13 www mediawiki org 6 ter localhost betreiben14 den oben schon erw hnten zustand da wikis ihrer struktur nach eher a nach innen verlinken versucht man durch sogenannte interwiki links zu ver ndern das sind links die automatisch zwischen verschiedenen wikis a auch auf verschiedenen servern gesetzt werden dazu m ssen diese server u nat rlich einmal dem wiki bekannt sein und zweitens zur vermeidung von u doppeldeutigkeiten jedes wiki mit einer eigenen namensraumerweiterung versehen werden eine besondere form der wikis sind blikis eine kombination aus weblog und wiki blikis versuchen die weblog funktionalit t in ein wiki zu integriea ren die bekanntesten vertreter dieser klasse sind vanilla 15 und snipsnap 16 ein in java am fraunhofer institut f r rechnerarchitektur und softwaretechu nik first entwickelter vanilla klon 3 werkzeuge 1 community server ping trackback rss dave winer ist einer der pioniere des webloggens er bot unter anderem auch kostenlose weblog services an aber da seine server von suchmaschinen und spidern uberlaufen waren suchte er nach einer m glichkeit diesen verkehr o zu minimieren so war die idee des ping geboren bei jedem neueintrag setzt die weblogsoftware einen ping17 an einen sogenannten community server ab dieser community server wei nun da es etwas neues auf der website gibt und schickt einen spider los diese neuen informationen zu sammeln gleichzeitig informiert eine webseite die community da es neues in diesem weblog gibt doch wo soll der community server eigentlich suchen das spidern von webseiten ist ein m hseliges gesch ft da layout und content informationen u a wild gemischt vorliegen hier nutzte winer eine andere technik die er schon fr her in einem anderen zusammenhang f r netscape entwickelt hatte rss18 u u eine sehr komfortables desktop wiki f r macos x ist moinx moinx antbear org u ein one click installer f r das in der scriptsprache python geschriebene wiki moin moin u da man es nicht nur als privates sondern auch als entliches wiki betreiben kann bieo tet es sich auch als kollaboratives werkzeug gemeinsamer zettelkasten f r kleinere u projektgruppen an 15 www vanillasite at vanilla ist in rebol einer ziemlich propriet ren scriptsprache a programmiert 16 snipsnap org 17 der ping ist ein simples xml paket das den community server informiert das in einem weblog oder auf einer website ein neuer beitrag erstellt wurde 18 rss steht meist f r rich side summary oder really simple syndication doch dar ber u u 14 7 dies ist eine spezielle xml datei die urspr nlich nur die uberschriften der u beitr ge einer website enthielt heute aber entweder auch zusammenfassuna gen der beitr ge oder gar den volltext der beitr ge selber rss ist inhalt a a pur jede layout information der webseiten ist eleminiert das macht rss speziell f r spider und andere bots gut lesbar und zur weiterverarbeitung u geeignet winers idee war es nun weblogs neben den html seiten auch rssseiten automatisch publizieren zu lassen und nur die rss seiten von seinem spider abzufragen dies und die idee des rss selber erwies sich als ungemein erfolgreich rss hat heute die begrenzte welt der weblgos l ngst verlassen und dient uberall dort im web als syndication format wo a regelm ige updates statt nden und man die welt uber diese updates ina formieren m chte19 o ben und mena trott die entwickler der popul ren weblogsoftware moa vabletype haben die idee des pings konsequent weiterentwickelt schon fr h u boten weblogs die m glichkeit zu kommentieren doch einige wie zum o beispiel winer stehen dieser m glichkeit skeptisch gegen ber wenn ich o u einen weblogbeitrag kommentiere sollte ich dies nicht konsequenterweise in meinem weblog tun die idee der trotts war es nun wenn ich einen beitrag eines fremden weblogs in meinem weblog kommentiere an dieses weblog ebenfalls einen ping abzusetzen der es darauf hinweist da sein beitrag kommentiert wurde der trackbackping oder kurz trackback 20 war geboren war es noch winers idee da der community server die updates aller weblogs au isten sollte entstanden schnell spezialisierte community server die nur noch die updates einer speziellen community meist eines einzelnen weblog hosters listeten im deutschsprachigen raum sammelten sich die ersten in der antville community21 eines der ersten europ ischen webloga dienste der dazu auch noch nichtkommerziell ausgerichtet war22 dabei wurde die community bildung zus tzlich dadurch angeregt da nur mitglieder a der antville community in antville blogs kommentieren durften dies bildet zwar einerseits einen relativ zuverl ssigen schutz gegen kommentarspam ist a aber auf der anderen seite eine ausgrenzung anderer webteilnehmer und streiten sich die experten noch uns soll es egal sein hauptsache wir wissen wie und das es funktioniert 19 vgl kantel 2007 20 das trackback protokoll ist ein wenig schlampig formuliert und meistens auch implementiert daher ist es etwas in verruf geraten dies ist schade denn es bietet auch die m glichkeit z b in wissenschaftlichen online arbeiten einen feedback uber das o zitiert werden zu geben eine verbesserte
7990759 8 daher wird diese form der community bis heute kontrovers diskutiert hier verl uft dann auch irgendwo die grenze zwischen weblog und diskussions a forum speziell in diesen geschlossenen communities gibt es oft beitr ge mit a dutzenden oder gar hunderten kommentaren hier steht nicht mehr der bei trag und sein autor im vordergrund sondern die diskussion23 der ubergang zu foren ist hier ie end aber auch den umgekehrten fall habe ich schon gesehen eine forensoftware die zu einem weblog aufgebohrt wurde 4 ajax ist k ein scheuerpulver herk mmliche webanwendungen sind stateless das hei t der server der eio ne seite an einen client ausliefert hat kein ged chtnis er wei nichts von a vorhergegangenen anfragen des gleichen clients dar berhinaus verlangt jeu de neue anfrage an einen server da eine seite komplett neu geladen werden mu auch wenn zum beispiel nur ein satz ver ndert wurde hier setzt a ajax ein ajax anwendungen ver ndern mit hilfe des document object a models dom und javascript den inhalt einer bestehenden webseite ohne einen vollst ndigen reload der seite zu erzwingen dar berhinaus sind a u ajax anwendungen asynchron das hei t w hrend eine anfrage an einen a server l uft kann im gleichen browserfenster weitergearbeitet werden das a ist das wof r ajax steht asynchronous javascript and xml u damit wird versucht applikationen im web dem verhalten von applikationen auf dem desktop anzupassen denken wir zum beispiel an eine textverarbeitung die ein fett markiertes wort auch sofort als fett markiert anzeigt und nicht erst nachdem man einen submit button gedr ckt hat man u kann mittlerweile mit hilfe von ajax faszinierende dinge im browser erledigen aber es gibt auch einige nachteile dieser technik die wichtigsten sind ajax ben tigt zwingend javascript menschen die aus sicherheitso gr nden javascript in ihrem browser ausgeschaltet haben oder die aus iru gendwelchen gr nden auf alternative clients die kein javascript beherru schen ausweichen m ssen man denke an braille ger te oder browser f r u a u sehbehinderte die den inhalt des browserfenster vorlesen sind von ajaxanwendungen ausgeschlossen das document object model ist in unterschiedlichen implementierungen dieses ph nomen ist aber nicht ausschlie lich an communities wie die antvillea community gebunden auch der spreeblick das popul re weblog von johnny h usler a a a hnelt mehr und mehr einem forum was sicher auch an der diskussionsfreudigkeit von johnny selber liegt und einige blawgs weblogs von rechtsanw lten sind von spezialia sierten jura foren ebenfalls kaum noch zu unterscheiden 23 9 je nach browser vorhanden das hei t die nach dem verdienten ende von dhtml schon totgeglaubten browserweichen feiern fr hliche urst nd o a und es gibt wieder webseiten die z b im safari apples hauseigenem browser nicht laufen oder die schlicht und einfach nur in browsern der mozillafamilie funktionieren die navigation mit hilfe des back buttons l uft nicht mehr wie der a nutzer es gewohnt ist in der regel l scht ein zur ck nicht mehr den letzten o u eintrag sondern setzt die seite in den ursprungszustand bevor die ajaxanwendung startete zur ck dieses verhalten ist vom benutzer oft nicht u vorhersehbar er wei nicht ob gerade eine ajax oder eine normale htmlanwendung l uft a damit verwandt ist das problem der deep links ajax anwendungen k nnen ohne programmiertechnische klimmz ge nur auf ihren ursprungso u zustand verlinkt werden das ajax schwierigkeiten bei der gestaltung von barrierefreien webseiten hat wurde weiter oben schon angesprochen hier wird in der literatur als ausweg fast immer empfohlen eine zweite ajax und javascript freie site parallel bereitzustellen dies ist nat rlich ein betr chtlicher mehraufu a wand und es ist immer zu pr fen ob die vorz ge von ajax diesen mehru u aufwand rechtfertigen fazit ajax ist ein faszinierende technologie die aber wegen der genannten probleme nur mit bedacht und umsicht eingesetzt werden sollte 5 webservices amp mashups webservices sind verteilte funktionen oder prozeduren die uber web techniken in der regel via http erreichbar sind der prozedur aufruf erfolgt fast immer uber ein get oder post und zur ckgeliefert wird meist u xml manchmal aber auch text pur oder javascript diese antworten werden dann via scriptsprachen oder ajax in eine webseite eingebunden google war einer der pioniere der webservices popul r wurden sie allerdings vor a allem durch kommmerzielle anbieter wie amazon oder ebay die es den sitebetreibern zum beispiel erm glichten einzelne produkte auf ihren webseiten o einzubinden die g ngigsten webservice methoden sind im einzelnen a xml rpc ist ein der altesten methdoden die von dave winer ent wickelt wurde weil ihm die arbeit an soap in dessen kommission winer auch sa zu lange dauerte xml rpc ist ein recht simples protokoll das als anfrage wie auch als antwort xml pakete erwartet 10 wegen seiner einfachheit ist xml rpc auch heute noch sehr beliebt und bei vielen webservices im einsatz soap das simple object application protocoll meist zusammen mit wsdl der webservice description language verwendet ist ebenfalls ein auf xml basierendes rpc protokoll das bedeutend umfangreicher und damit auch komplizierter als xml rpc ist soap wird in der hauptsache in enterprise anwendungen eingesetzt aber auch das google api war bis vor kurzem eine reine soap anwendung24 das dritte im bunde der webservice protokolle ist rest der representational state transfer hier werden anfragen via put get post oder delete an uris verschickt die die parameter bergabe u regeln und zur ck kommt eine antwort entweder als xml die reu gel oder als html manchmal aber auch als text pur oder in einem beliebigen anderen format rest macht da keine vorschriften nat rlich sind webservices auch via javascript und oder ajax zu u realisieren hier ist das antwortformat oft json die javascript object notation die nat rlich von javascript direkt ohne aufwendiges parsen u gelesen werden kann json ist mittlerweile so erfolgreich da auch anwendungen in java php perl und python existieren die dieses format nutzen und man kann auch einfache webservices mithilfe von rss realisieren diese m glichkeit wird viel von werbetreibenden gen tzt die o u damit immer aktuelle anzeigen in die partnerseiten einbinden webservices und die dazugeh renden apis application programming o interfaces werden heute von einer vielzahl von webdiensten angeboten und bilden die grundlage f r mashups die aus diversen webservices und u wom glich wieder mit hilfe von ajax eine anwendung zusammenbauen o webservices und mashups k nnen auch f r alternative clients z b gooo u gle earth25 yahoo widgets26 vormals konfabulator oder apples dashboard27 entwickelt werden mittlerweile hat google das soap api aufgek ndigt und setzt f r die zukunft komu u plett auf ajax 25 earth google com 26 widgets yahoo com 27 www apple com de macosx features dashboard 24 11 6 social software community server sind heute mehr als reine update und inhaltsverzeichnisse von weblogs einer community technorati 28 zum beispiel ist so etwas wie ein ranking verzeichnis welches weblog ist wie popul r wobei die poa pularit t nach der zahl der verlinkungen entschieden wird eine webloga suchmaschine und eine art verbesserter trackback server welches weblog linkt auf mein weblog technorati basiert auf dem prinzip des pings um von technorati indiziert zu werden mu man technorati anpingen daneben indiziert technorati spezialisierte tags und kann aufzeigen welche weblogbeitr ge welche tags verwendet haben man kann danach suchen a oder sich tagwolken anzeigen lassen weitere popul re aber nicht die einzigen webservices die tags verwena den sind die photo community flickr29 die k rzlich von yahoo gekauft u wurde und der bookmark online dienst del icio us30 ebenfalls im dezember 2005 von yahoo aufgekauft beides sind server dienste das hei t die tags werden nicht via ping und rss eingesammelt sondern die links und photos werden direkt auf dem server getagged im videobereich ist die frage nach dem platzhirschen unter den verschiedenen anbietern noch nicht endg ltig entschieden allerdings w chst youu a tube 31 ziemlich schnell und nachdem google diesen videodienst f r ca 1 6 u mrd dollar gekauft hat scheint auch hier das rennen gelaufen zu sein popul r und geradezu mit dem begri web 2 0 verbunden sind aber auch a die sogenannten social networks anwendungen deren hauptzweck es ist die nutzer miteinander zu vernetzen und miteinander kommunizieren zu lassen die bandbreite ist vielf ltig da gibt es reine business portale wie das zu a 32 xing mutierte ehemalige openbc zielgruppenportale wie das k rzlich u 33 etwas in verruf geratene und von holtzbrinck gekaufte studivz das sich an studenten wendet eher unspezi sche teenager portale wie das von murdoch gekaufte myspace 34 aber auch so etwas wie das von google betriebene orkut 35 das ich eher als kontaktb rse

7990798 silencing citizens should concern us all by grim at august 26 2008 3 50 pm it is unfortunate to see the obama campaign moving to silence political speech by citizens during an election their attempt to get the justice department to investigate and prosecute a 501c4 for daring to mention obamas relationship with ayers is un american there is blame to go around though i am personally opposed to sen obamas candidacy in fairness it is proper to note that sen mccain authored a number of the restrictions on american political speech being used by sen obama we can even go further and point out the claims by sen mccains campaign manager of outrageous attacks by then gov bushs campaign that allegedly slandered him and his adopted daughter in the hope of playing on racist feeling in the electorate neither president bush who signed the law nor sen mccain who wrote the law nor sen obama who used the law to silence american citizens none of them should escape our wrath on this matter all americans and all bloggers regardless of affiliation should have a sense of unity the founding fathers wrote the protections of the first amendment for free speech and the press they had political speech foremost in their thoughts when they did so the freedom to speak about elections candidates and issues of concern was exactly what they were seeking to protect we have come to a time in america when our political class wants desperately to silence american citizens they want to speak only to each other let sen mccains campaign say what it wants but no mere citizen should dare to do so lest they face criminal prosecution

7990802 ive seen lots of burlesque shows where they do a good tease but i dont remember the performer because they didnt do anything that was really outrageous or funny or unique
7990803 thats not the case with a lot of other burlesque shows i think the cleverness and the humor are what we have to offer above all
7990804 id just gotten interested in burlesque and was doing some research on the subject the whole thing really appealed to me for some reason jeremy her brother jeremy gable the artistic director of hunger artists got really excited about the idea because there wasnt anything like it around here
7990805 i was looking for people who were funny and clever
7990806 we were all like shaking in our stilettos that first night

7990809 i dont think im the only girl who went out there thinking oh my god im wearing just a bra on stage
7990810 but it was very empowering the audience was right there with us if something went wrong if a costume change didnt happen right they laughed with us they were hugely supportive
7990811 we didnt know if anybody would show up we thought thered be just cricket noises in the audience
7990812 only pulitzer prize winner cormac mccarthy can call me that
7990813 i think some people would argue that this isnt empowering that were exploiting ourselves
7990814 thats an argument i understand but i dont think thats how any of us feel this is something that we control theres nobody telling us what to do it all comes from us its our own fantasies and ideas and stories

7990883 i cannot recommend a site any more than this one
7990884 he is absolute in his justice seeking beautifully informational staunchly analytical and a joy to behold i consider it both a duty and a delight to keep coming back here
7990885 upon only a first and second look i d say you should read everything posted by voice of a native son
7990886 intelligentaindigena has great commentary and interesting links that will always make you leaving the site a little more wiser
7990887 an extraordinary blogger posting on news from around the world for issues dealing with oppression of any kind
7990888 he covers issues of interest to all aboriginal peoples from around the world not just native americans
7990889 i do not feel we should forfeit the traditional rights and privileges of the natives of our islands for a mere thimbleful of votes in congress that we the lovers of hawaii from long association with it should sacrifice our birthright for the greed of alien desires to remain on our shores

7990901 is a big incentive to buy now versus later when you most likely wont have that option for you
7990902 it makes a lot of sense for builders to do a lot of promotions on that
7990903 were trying to let everyone know hey this is going away
7990904 if you can come up with some way to monetize it ahead of time it could help to offset the loss of that down payment assistance
7990905 you can offer lower rates you can offer further incentives
7990906 but if a homebuyer is going to have trouble coming up with a down payment thats difficult to offset
7990907 die banken m ssen zumindest stichprobenartig bei verd chtigen abbuchungen pr fen ob ein kontoinhaber dieser abbuchung berhaupt zugestimmt hat

7990911 vigorous expression of the freedoms that make our society great
7990912 and each generation needs to explore the history of the past to understand fully the context in which these polar extremes come into clashes with one another so history of how we dealt with these problems in the 1940s and 1950s is a current history and a history that is very important for us to understand
7990913 theres lots of stuff to do animals for the kids to pet local merchants rides its really fun for kids its upstate new york but its so worth the drive its also a really beatiful area
7990914 we were surprised to find such a pronounced reduction in basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma incidence in users of ace inhibitors or arbs in such a high risk group over a short amount of time
7990915 because individuals at normal risk of keratinocyte cancer were not included in our study the extent to which the results might apply to such individuals is unknown
7990916 with three real examples we hope that we have shown that such trials are feasible and can lead to major improvements in speed and decision making
7990917 further study of the arid4 gene family may advance our understanding of the connection between gene regulation epigenetic control disease development and cancer formation
7990918 we also suggest that gene regulation by the arid4a and arid4b should be examined for potential disease related roles not only in human malignancies but also in other complex disease traits
7990919 our findings suggest that individuals presenting with features of inherited rcc susceptibility should be screened for germ line sdhb mutations because surveillance for sdhb related tumors can then be offered to mutation positive patients and relatives
7990920 it is entirely appropriate at this time to counsel patients carrying sdhb mutations espe cially those with arg mutations that they have a small but finite likelihood of developing rcc
7990921 in conclusion our results suggest that nut corn and popcorn consumption is not associated with an increased risk of incident diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding and may be protective for the former these findings refute the pervasive but unproven belief that these foods are associated with diverticular complications and suggest that the recommendation to avoid these foods in diverticular disease should be reconsidered
7990922 the company positioned itself as a global provider ahead of the curve and was in place and operational when clients recognized the need for a global focus
7990923 the rapid adoption of globoforces strategic employee recognition solution by global 2000 corporations based in both the u s and europe continues to fuel our tremendous track record of growth
7990924 we have found that many of the worlds largest organizations realize that the proven business benefits of having a mechanism in place to recognize inspire motivate retain and ultimately engage a global workforce is essential to their companys ongoing profitable operation particularly during this current challenging global economic environment

7990931 we are pleased to add nugg ad to our growing european customer base
7990932 nugg ad has developed a new exciting approach to predictive behavioral targeting for the advertising industry but at the end of the day it will only be as effective as the technical infrastructure on which it is based neustar is pleased to be a component of their success
7990933 we are pleased with the results of the quarter the strong revenue increases coupled with the significant improvement in our bottom line results are in line with managements expectations the addition of four new clients two through our partners and two direct by our sales force indicate we are achieving significant traction with our sales and marketing initiatives so far this year in addition we are beginning to develop the type of distribution channel that will drive consistent sales growth in the coming months and years in that regard as we previously announced scott boyden joined streamline health in late june as senior vice president of sales and marketing with the responsibility of managing and directing all of our sales and marketing activities we believe that under his leadership our distribution partners as well as our in house sales team will become even more effective in penetrating the large and growing markets that our solutions can address
7990934 on advancing two important strategic goals during the quarter 1 to expand our operations internationally and 2 to expand our market reach outside provider organizations to the public health sector that have a need to manage and process documents that are fragmented across multiple locations our contract with mcgill university health center and the centre hospitalier de luniversite de montreal through our distribution partner emergis opens the door for future business in canada europe and asia for our multi language document workflow solutions likewise our contract with the columbus ohio public health vital statistics office represents the first order in a large market segment that includes virtually all state local and municipal governments throughout the u s we believe there are great opportunities ahead in both of these large markets
7990935 we continue to invest in our new architecture platform to enhance the capabilities of our solutions provide multi language support and significantly reduce time to market for new workflow solutions during the quarter we completed the first two of a series of new workflow solutions financial screening and cash management workflows we continue to develop and upgrade the multi language version of our flagship product accessanyware tm to provide greater functionality we anticipate the delivery of additional workflows in the second half of the year we are dedicated to maintaining a strong research and development effort as we expect to expand our product offerings to address the needs of other market segments both domestically and internationally we believe this new architecture will set the stage for improved operating and financial performance going forward
7990936 im sure theres going to be a rather difficult period in our discussions
7990937 if it goes in the direction of aggravating relations its not going to be our choice but i want to remind you that cold war was a completely different beast when we were really at each others throats in a big way internationally and this is not going to happen under any circumstances
7990938 their use of force against south ossetia clearly dashed all of those previous resolutions and created a completely new reality
7990939 only reinforcing the desire of the people in abkhazia and south ossetia to obtain their independence
7990940 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
7990941 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
7990942 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
7990943 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
7990944 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
7990945 we are connecting with fans and sponsors like never before
7990946 but we want things to continue to get better to continue to grow
7990947 is a big incentive to buy now versus later when you most likely wont have that option for you
7990948 it makes a lot of sense for builders to do a lot of promotions on that
7990949 were trying to let everyone know hey this is going away

7991062 forrester analysts tj keitt and paul jackson came up with a new phrase to describe video games
7991063 the phrase the industry should rally around is serious games to bring together the numerous disciplines however forrester recommends identifying individual games with the underlying goal of the game for example calling volvo car uks game an immersive learning simulation we dont see this being an issue in a few years as the old guard in the workforce is replaced by younger colleagues as this happens doubts about calling a game a game will subside future business leaders are already thinking in terms of games as seen with ibms bpm video game coming out of a competition between business students at duke university and the university of north carolina at chapel hill

7991094 in using one of his first three line item vetoes president clinton today dashed a texas billionaires plan to preserve a capital gains tax break while renegotiating the sale of one of his businesses and in doing so mr clinton highlighted the sort of special benefits that have long found their way into the nations tax laws often to the benefit of only a handful of wealthy or influential people in this case the president unraveled the plans of 2 000 beet farmers and of harold c simmons who has given more than 1 million to republican candidates and causes since the early 1980s a provision in the tax bill included at the behest of several members of congress would have granted mr simmons and the oregon beet farmers something they all desired a graceful exit out of a cumbersome joint venture they had formed for the sole purpose of cutting mr simmonss tax bill to defer or avoid at least 80 million in capital gains taxes on the sale of a beet sugar refining company mr simmons formed the joint venture with the snake river sugar cooperative which the beet farmers had set up for the purpose the joint venture was to own the plant sharing profits under existing tax laws this arrangement was not technically a sale and mr simmons owed no capital gains taxes even though the cooperative paid him 260 million

7991107 saturday we were watching the video from the scrimmage when it was done he just said sean stay in the room tyrod you and cory wait outside the door i knew the decision was coming i just didnt know whether he was going to say tyrods redshirting or you and tyrod are splitting reps when he said stay in here i was like alright well heres the decision ive been waiting for the last six months obviously it was the one i was hoping for now ive just got to prove they made the right decision and go out and make the most of it
7991108 honestly the only hints i had were if i ever read the papers they honestly talked to yall more the first day of camp they told me and tyrod battle it out and well give you a decision at the end of camp and literally thats the next time they talked about it nothing
7991109 no i havent talked to him i dont know what went on behind closed doors but it seems like a decision he may have been ok with or because he was not in a bad mood that day its not like he was spacey or ticked off i plan on talking to him eventually just letting him know i did basically the same and trust me im glad i did it im sure you will be in three years too
7991110 i felt good i felt like i was going to be out on the field regardless whether it was 50 percent or 100 percent i didnt know but i felt like i played well enough in camp that i was going to be out there so i didnt have any real anxiety of not playing but definitely i was happy its what ive been working for
7991111 yeah i told my girlfriend my parents i told eddie royal i told my brother i told five or six besides the family not many
7991112 not quite i wouldnt say that im definitely very pleased because my goal this whole offseason was i want to be the guy but like i said i felt like i was going to be on the field one way or another its just kind of a bonus ill be out there every snap now i wouldnt say a relief but definitely a good feeling it all worked out
7991113 definitely if i dont have time up front in these scrimmages it may be tyrod outshining me they might have to go the same direction since the line cant hold up weve got to go with a more mobile quarterback if they dont do a good job then i cant do a good job and if i cant do a good job then they probably go with the other guy so im very pleased with how theyre playing other than a couple times i was pretty much able to stand back there and find the open guy
7991114 i guess you could look at it that way but im not putting that on myself im doing my best i think i did a good job with it the second half of last year just to go out and play have fun especially this year its my last year im hoping its not but it could be my last year of football and im not going to waste it putting the weight of the world on the shoulders im going to have fun im going to be focused and work hard but at the same time ive learned over my career that reading all the expectations and listening to all the people and trying to prove something isnt the best way to go about things
7991115 its a step if i go out there and wet the bed it doesnt mean anything what i did this camp but its definitely a stepping stone my first goal was to win the job now that ive done that its on to the next goal i wouldnt say ive proven myself until a few more goals are reached
7991116 i have personal goals about taking care of the ball and completion percentage and stuff like that but the main goals are can i get this team back to an acc championship can i get us to another 10 win season can we get back to a bcs bowl those are the big goals
7991117 im sure there are im sure there are people that are very happy with the decision and im sure there are a lot of people that are going to be sending me and coach beamer e mails about the situation thats just the nature of the beast someones going to be unhappy but im hoping most of the hokie nation is just behind whoever the coaches feel like is the best guy for the job im hoping everybody rallies behind me but theres always going to be a few
7991118 i think i have won the team over most of the guys that werent behind him arent in this locker room anymore i think the younger crew either theyre behind me or they have no choice but to be behind me but ive caught no negative no nothing from anyone inside that locker room so my guess would be everyones ready to roll
7991119 who were going to be throwing to has been pretty much set practice yesterday was probably one of my favorite practices because i had six receivers i was throwing to and thats it wed been rotating everybody through so i had 11 12 receivers i was throwing to it was hard to develop much of a rapport or chemistry but now its down to six im excited for the coming weeks running back thats a different story talking to the running backs coach hite told all six of them be ready saturday kenny lewis will be the starter what happens after that we just have to kind of play it by ear theres no point in me trying to think about whos lined up behind me because it could change on any play
7991120 i really do actually not to take anything away from branden hes probably the most talented running back ive ever handed off to individually but this committee weve got right now just with how they all bring something unique to the table defenses cant prepare for one style kennys fast evans will run you over oglesbys kind of a rare mix of strength and speed cheeseman kind of has the branden ore jukes they all kind of bring something to the table last year when branden got hurt when he was suspended you were kind of uncertain now if one guy goes down its just fill the next guy in im real confident with those guys
7991121 you have to have faith i cant go into the game leery that ikes going to drop a ball or dyrells going to screw up this route i have to have faith that theyre not going to do that but it is wait and see in a sense a lot of guys are great practice players then when they get on the main stage not so good but to be honest theres just as many that in practice arent anything special then all the sudden when the lights are on the games on the line they rise to the occasion so itll be kind of wait and see but i just have to have faith theyre going to get the job done
7991122 i guess dyrell would be the closest thing to eddie just because i think we got a glimpse of what he can do in the return game last week thats what made eddie so dynamic dyrell had a couple impressive returns kind of reminded me of things eddie did his freshman year hopefully he can be that double threat like eddie was
7991123 i dont really care too much about records individual records i know im starting to climb up the ladder on some of those but i dont really care if i could be the guy that brought two straight acc championships the first guy i think in tech history to win back to back conference championships i dont know did mike vick do it no well then that would be a pretty good legacy that would be something id be proud of
7991124 knocked on the wood table i dont want to jinx myself but i pride myself on being a tough player unless i really am i hurt im always going to pop up i dont want the defender to have the satisfaction i know its very important that i stay healthy for tyrods sake marcus stayed healthy for my sake i hope i can do the same thing not only for tyrod but my own sake id like to play a full healthy season im just going to pray that nothing freak happens
7991125 no im going to do whatever i think is best for that play im not going to change my style of play to avoid getting hurt
7991126 it was really short and sweet he said were going to redshirt tyrod youre the guy go do it thats basically all he said
7991127 put mccains speech against obamas and this was a wipe out

7991133 may not be the way we or the way your family last remembers her we need to find out from you where caylee is this this this right now is just this has gone so far down hill and this has become such a mess
7991134 we need to end it its very simple we just need to end it
7991135 i agree with you i have no clue where she is
7991136 caylees out there somewhere and her rotting body is starting to decompose
7991137 i know my mom will never forgive me im never going to forgive myself because theres that chance that i may not see caylee again and i dont want to think about that
7991138 gave caylee to someone that you dont want anyone to find out because you think youre a bad mom or something happened to caylee and caylees buried somewhere or in a trash can somewhere and you had something to do with it
7991139 the longer this goes the worse its gonna be for everyone everyone
7991140 she handed the kid off to somebody and has herself in a bind right now and she doesnt know what to do she could simply tell the cops i didnt want my daughter anymore and i gave her away
7991141 you look at everybody equally and with respect anyone is capable of beating anybody if theyre playing well and youre not so we prepare exactly like we would for anybody
7991142 jimmy stevens has been consistent and solid through our camp
7991143 former broken arrow quarterback carter whitson has been very good replacing hays mceachern in holding snaps and hes been very good
7991144 were planning on him to be the one unless he doesnt perform all week at practice
7991145 and then well see who else is ready to play
7991146 everything ive seen to this point hes really caught the ball well and then hes really shown an ability to make people miss him to find seams to find holes and to make some big plays with it hopefully well see that as we go through the year
7991147 sure well go into each game with the ability to do both
7991148 i think were at a point where hopefully itll be fairly natural for us to do that
7991149 as much as anything you just want to start to see the personality of your team
7991150 you see it through the year to some degree and i like what ive seen but until youre in competition until youre out on the field by themselves and in the moment and having to deal with 3 to 4 hours of football you know how do you come out at halftime whats your attitude through the whole game until you see that happening you dont really know what kind of toughness do you come out with all those things you want to see it on the field

7991157 traders of physical crude oil say their market is suffering from too much supply not too little
7991158 there are simply no buyers because the market has more than enough oil
7991159 theres various signals out there saying for right now the markets are well supplied with crude
7991160 energy markets have been dictated for too long by hedge funds and speculators who artificially manipulate the numbers for their own benefit the current market isnt based on the sound principles of supply and demand but it is being rigged by companies and speculators who are jacking up prices for their own greed

7991163 i think its no secret and ive said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process
7991164 what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7991165 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together over this period of time
7991166 so we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we know what is in israel and what is in palestine that is ultimately the goal

7991169 just because we have not yet succeeded does not mean we have failed

7991174 after 20 minutes the pilot called nyala airport to tell him the plane had been hijacked and that he is en route to tripoli in libya
7991175 i am worried about my father and mother they are coming from nyala on this flight no one has any information about the situation they are in
7991176 this is the result of what the government is doing in the camps of displaced people in nyala
7991177 im not sure if its connected to kalma but its related to that the government kills and the international community does not intervene what can the darfurian people do
7991178 funding arrangements for schools that are riddled with anomalies and flaws
7991179 the only way out in the longer term is for a root and branch review of the arrangements involving all funding partners
7991180 1 5 billion for government schools would be required merely to reclaim the sector shares in place at the outset of the howard years
7991181 if continued they will result in a cut in real terms for the school system that educates the majority of australian children
7991182 howard government policies benefited non government schools by almost 3 billion in real terms a funding advantage of around 2 5 billion over the real increases provided for government schools

7991223 tonight when hillary clinton speaks she will be an articulate voice for the working men and women the middle class families that have been squeezed and she will make the case as she uniquely can for why barack obama is the right choice for the presidency
7991224 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7991225 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7991226 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7991227 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7991228 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7991229 gt bentley warren a six time winner of the international classic supermodified race at oswego speedway sits in the 15 car getting ready for a recent practice session at the track the 200 lap classic is slated for sunday
7991230 you kind of feel it by what the car is doing

7991236 pizza is one of the most widely eaten dishes in the world and it should never cost more than 3 50 5 99
7991237 we launched this initiative because pizza has become more and more expensive vis a vis the general surge in food prices and we want to help consumers and their families make ends meet each month
7991238 pizza is a poor mans dish and a passing fancy for the rich
7991239 tomorrow thursday we will give them away free to protest against those who are trying to trade on their price increase

7991244 experienced an in flight depressurisation incident which caused the oxygen masks on board to deploy
7991245 as a safety precaution the captain descended and diverted the aircraft to limoges airport
7991246 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
7991247 i would say some people thought we were going to die
7991248 for about half an hour no one told us anything we didnt know what was happening at all we were quite panicky
7991249 after half an hour we were told to take the oxygen mask off and then the plane landed and we were fine
7991250 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
7991251 they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
7991252 as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8000 feet where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off that they were diverting to limoges
7991253 the irish and french aviation authorities have been notified of this incident and a full investigation of this incident will be undertaken later today
7991254 i sent my mum a text phone message amp squo i love you and i am going down amp squo

7991257 the message is clear we have made a demand for change for freedom and for justice
7991258 the people do not want to be exploited we want an economic order that protects all the people
7991259 yes of course we have lost we were the underdogs going into this race
7991260 this is a clear indication that people of all races have rejected the communal politics of barisan nasional it is a clear endorsement of our reform agenda we are on track to take over the government

7991273 i really tried to emphasise here that this process up to copenhagen is a golden opporutnity for african countries to make sure that the next regime does meet their needs in a much better way
7991274 they need to formulate what is essential to them to act both to limit emissions and to adapt to the impacts of climate change
7991275 africa has to know whats to the liking of africa
7991276 africa is still not profiting from the instruments we have
7991277 countries have developed a better understanding here of how they want to deal with deforestation how they want to reward people for forest conservation
7991278 i think theres a strong sentiment in the room especially among developing countries that a decision to address a sector is something you decide at the national level
7991279 its not something that you could or should try to impose at the international level
7991280 dems have used the same playbook to guide themselves to losing presidential campaigns for decades here are the techniques obama should avoid in the presidential race of 2004 we had the two americas in this years race we have the two obamas the one who has drawn repeated comparisons to jfk rfk and mlk and the one who has drawn comparisons to adlai stevenson michael dukakis and john kerry whether obama will win the general election depends on whether he and his campaign make sure that the right obama shows up for the remainder of the campaign obama was losing this time last year to hillary clinton until he changed course at the jefferson jackson dinner in iowa in november and started inspiring voters again in a way that only a once in a generation leader can do he lost much of the second half of the primary season as his negatives rose consistently in response to her sustained blows as he refused even to put his hands up to block them from the time he became the presumptive nominee until the last two weeks democrats have been growing increasingly alarmed that they were poised to lose another unloseable election as his campaign was once again turning obama the charismatic leader into obama the rambling dispassionate conflict avoidant traditional democratic presidential candidate
7991281 above all else we want a candidate with a relentless passion to succeed whatever the adversity
7991282 the type of person we will be looking for is someone whose cup is always half full never half empty someone who can laugh at themselves a strong team player who sees this as a lifetime opportunity and can tell a good joke to keep others spirits up
7991283 to support individuals of all ages nationalities and backgrounds who exemplify the spirit of sir ernest shackleton inspirational leaders wishing to make a difference in particular to the less advantaged
7991284 were here to say thank you to hillary and to protest the fraud perpetrated on us by the democratic national committee
7991285 it wasnt a contest it was a foregone conclusion they the dnc leadership just decided that barack obama was going to win
7991286 its going to be the first time since 1976 that i havent voted i just dont trust obama i think hell do more harm than good
7991287 were here to tell the democratic leadership that its not okay to ignore 18 million voices
7991288 i dont trust obama he flip flops all the time we dont know anything about his past how do we know hes not some kind of militant im voting for mccain
7991289 theres a lot of us who feel pissed and angry at the party for the way hillary was treated there was a lot of sexism in the media and the whole process seemed rigged against her
7991290 at the moment i dont know who i am voting for i want to be able to forgive barack obama but what happened to hillary bugs me i dont know though that i could bring myself to vote for a republican
7991291 i was unhappy and upset that she lost but im going to be voting for obama in november
7991292 hes a brilliant leader and we have to have unity in the party to win the election
7991293 im disappointed hurt and angry about hillary but im not deluded
7991294 four more years of a bush presidency under mccain would be a disaster for our country
7991295 were not going to shoot ourselves in the foot in november hillary rocks but any true democrat will vote for obama

7991300 evacuations could begin as early as tomorrow there is no impact on production at this time

7991315 to an extent it does there are so many people who come up to me and tell me that they bought ganga bindis and saris named after my character
7991316 we are not endorsing the image we get good money to play a character and that we do as actors
7991317 the reality part is about learning frustrations about not performing well disappointments getting naughty and shaking it all
7991318 my work hours are long and erratic but when your work is recognised and you are promoted to head a team of 25 you dont complain
7991319 not to forget the perks of travelling to exotic locations companies are happy to hire fresh graduates as they are energetic ambitious and without distracting family commitments
7991320 they bring eagerness and resilience to the job exhibiting contagious enthusiasm and work energy
7991321 the opportunity to network the exposure and the hands on training one gets by working in a consultancy is unmatched
7991322 i want to do an mba but i am not convinced in doing a management degree if ive never been managed or have managed people before working gives me that perfect platform to gear up for masters
7991323 while the mba balloon still flies one cannot undermine the potential of fresh graduates
7991324 im moving the high court along with two other girls from my party whose nominations were rejected we have solid grounds for our case and im sure the hc will give a stay order so i can apply for re nomination since i deserve this seat
7991325 the proposer verification section has my name in it the other two girls made the same mistake
7991326 its only because the principal has certified the proposer and the seconders names instead of the candidates that theyve been disqualified if he did this with eyes shut why should the candidates suffer a mistake on his part reflects the univs fault well try for a stay on the elections however theres little chance its never happened before
7991327 nsui was promoting undeserving candidates apni kulhadi apne hi pair pe maar li it hardly makes a difference to us as for a stay order i dont think that will happen
7991328 these people belong to mainstream political parties and that they still make such errors shows how careless they are they dont even know how to fill up a form
7991329 if they get the permission from the hc well consider them otherwise we have other aspirants like tanu yadav
7991330 this might give smaller players a chance to win by merit and not due to political backing and money
7991331 when we hollered down at her we saw her stick her head out which was a blessing to all of us
7991332 those guys have nothing to do with our organization whatsoever nothing none of our guys know who they are we heard one of them was wearing a sons of silence support t shirt but you can buy that online or at any of our swap meets
7991333 its not a matter of polls as you know the polls arent particularly wonderful
7991334 its a matter of my responsibility as prime minister to make a decision on whether i think the fall session of parliament can be productive
7991335 certainly spending weeks and weeks playing telephone tag with guys doesnt help me confirm that things are going to be very productive
7991336 the prime minister is panicking trying to invent reasons to trigger an election
7991337 as you know he has a fixed election date law to respect hes ready to call an election and say once again i broke my words
7991338 education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned in school

7991357 food can look taste and smell normal so you wont know the infection is there weeks after you purchased the contaminated products
7991358 we also dont know the extent of the outbreak yet and its really too soon to know now that coupled with the long incubation period makes this outbreak very concerning
7991359 both the numbers of suspected cases and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues
7991360 i think all of us expect that when we shop that the things we buy or that we eat are going to be safe
7991361 thats why i indicated that its necessary to reform and revamp our food and product inspection regimes
7991362 vigorous expression of the freedoms that make our society great
7991363 and each generation needs to explore the history of the past to understand fully the context in which these polar extremes come into clashes with one another so history of how we dealt with these problems in the 1940s and 1950s is a current history and a history that is very important for us to understand
7991364 no wonder why these people dont want to relinquish power
7991365 who would want to leave such high life the cost of these cars alone would pull zimbabwe out of its mess
7991366 there is really nothing to talk about in the presidents speech
7991367 it is hollow it does not address fundamental issues like employment increased production and how zimbabwe might become self sufficient

7991401 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 7 8 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others local residents were able to confirm the number of casualties including names age and gender of the victims
7991402 almost certainly the deadliest case of civilian casualties caused by any united states military operation in afghanistan since 2001
7991403 only that 25 militants and five civilians were killed in the air strikes which were aimed at a taliban named mullah saddiq
7991404 and five others were wounded in western afghanistan when a convoy of afghan and united states forces called in airstrikes on the officers thinking they were militants
7991405 in what has become a dolefully familiar episode local afghan officials reported saturday that dozens of civilians and perhaps a great many more were killed during united states led coalition airstrikes this time in the grishk district of the southern province of helmand where dozens of civilians died under similar circumstances last week

7991408 domination in public space is the most obvious manifestation of attempts to control the city and appears to be particularly prevalent in latin america traditionally the city center is the arena in which organized social political and class conflicts are played out again one can observe that this domination is constantly contested in chile argentina and uruguay public spaces serve as important landmarks for detention and torture as well as prortesting state terror this is never more apparent than in protests against human rights abuses intitiated by the madres de la plaza de mayo such movements not only contested the domination of public space by regimes of terror they also used public space often regarded as predominantly male domain and symbolically masculine where a distinct set of rules and forms of deplortment apply such as during the paseo which often consists of men walking ahead of women to express a gendered construction of power and space even when the occupation of space is passive the women in guadalajara expressed their resistance by occupying a space of mulitple meanings an elite location an essentially male dominated location and useing a spatial imagery of contrasting a landscape of plenty with one of poverty such a message could be equally employed in the context of street children in brazil

7991420 is there a democrate out there that can tell us why we arent drilling off shore and in anwar thats what i want to know
7991421 offshore drilling would only reduce gas prices two cents in 10 years
7991422 funny the mere mention of domestic drilling has brought the price for a barrel of oil down roughly 20 00 in the past month which in turn has reflected a corresponding decrease at the pumps
7991423 i still have to have someone with a legit reason tell me how the republicans actually caused high gas prices and more importantly how drilling isnt a solution
7991424 seeming to enjoy the back and forth she followed with another question can we drill your brains
7991425 i believe in natural gas as a clean cheap alternative to fossil fuels
7991426 why is it that if we drill here and produce 3 million additional barrels a day it will only reduce gas prices 02 10 per gallon but if we pressure the saudis and the produce an additional 3 million a day it will reduce the price by 50 1 00 is their barrel better
7991427 looks like 9 approval rating pelosi still doesnt get it over 70 of americans want to drill now
7991428 reduction of 2 cents in 10 years heck thats better than the democrat controlled house and senate have done dont forget they are the ones in power

7991469 boundary scan is an excellent example of how the efforts of a cross industry group can benefit all of the electronics industry
7991470 if we can generate greater support for boundary scan among electronic design automation eda tools suppliers and chip makers many of the downstream electronics companies such as circuit board makers and systems providers stand to benefit greatly because their products will improve in quality their test procedures will be more comprehensive and less costly
7991471 since its development in the 1990s adoption of boundary scan has benefited the industry greatly we want to expand upon this base and take it up to another level
7991472 we feel that the boundary scan ecosystem is not yet complete and we want to do what we can to ensure this technology can be applied effectively in design validation test and debug applications for chips circuit boards and systems this will pave the way for other standards that support methodologies for more complex embedded instruments such as the internal jtag ijtag ieee p1687 standard that is currently being developed

7991524 this is going to be a fight over who is going to be best for the average american and who will get the economy growing again in a way that benefits everyone and not just a wealthy well connected few
7991525 many people do not pay close attention to policies early in an election after the conventions and labor day they start comparing platforms and as soon as anybody does that the choice will be clear
7991526 we will call for change and we will say what that change is
7991527 measuring the success of the economy by what it does for ordinary families recognition that the way to promote growth is to invest in ordinary families how is the economy doing for you is ultimately the most important question for us
7991528 no one in the mccain campaign is going to run a tv ad about the need to cut corporation tax
7991529 they are trying to turn this whole campaign into an up or down vote on obama people havent been paying attention very much and when they do they will see the difference john mccain is going to have to explain in the debates why all he wants to do is cut taxes for corporations and the richest americans
7991530 it is a question of who gets the tax cuts the obama plan gets tax relief to 95 per cent of working americans
7991531 the only place these people want to be is home
7991532 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way

7991539 i thought we had a real shot at dwyane wade
7991540 because he loved beating up on louisville and kentucky when he was in college unfortunately however he didnt seem to think our offer of a t shirt and all the papa johns pizza he could eat was quite enough
7991541 im urging all our fans to bombard him with voice mails and instant messages in fact im thinking seriously of bringing in former indiana coach kelvin sampson to show us just how thats done
7991542 but his trash talking would be a distraction hopefully more for them than for us crawford has a great pedigree he and his dad are the luke and bill walton of local journalism and im trying to lure kelch and andrews by promising they also can be judges for the dance team contest
7991543 i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair and i didnt spend those five and a half years because not because i wanted to get a house when i got out
7991544 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
7991545 take off the suit and if you want to go one on one two on one and put a couple of you guys together they all like to put the comic book characters together come at me
7991546 im not talking about financial box office im talking about one on one with these puts up fists
7991547 the only thing thats not excellent about my performance is that i dont swear but i dont need to i dont need that crutch theres too much else going on that i have to rely on then just dropping the f bomb but other than that theres nothing held back
7991548 i guarantee you theres not a badder dude in a movie this year than max payne
7991549 this is like my character from the departed fear four brothers all mixed into one times ten
7991550 its one thing to play a quiet guy one of few words thats not what max payne is this guy raises his voice hes in your face hes screaming crying laughing its the most fun ive had playing a part
7991551 that announcement made my head spin iron man isnt dark iron man worked because favreau brought in all the best iron man creators and had them read the script and asked them tell me what we did wrong and it worked because it had all the best things about iron man boiled down into the best movie they could make the dark knight was really good because it had all the best things about batman boiled down into the best movie they could make making a superman movie thats a dark and gritty movie is stupid
7991552 you always have to always keep superman very distinct from batman
7991553 batman can be brooding and bleak and dark but superman if you want to take a realistic approach to him thats fine but i dont think you can turn him into an angry character superman is about the hope in people the good in people whereas batman is about the more driven hungry for justice angry side of us so i dont know if doing a dark superman is the approach but im all for a reboot
7991554 superman the character inspires hope as opposed to batman who inspires fear
7991555 superman for all seasons is about clark kent trying to deal with the fact that he has this incredible power and responsibility and that was an interesting concept to me and one of the other things that i find interesting is that hes set out to perform a job that will never finish a never ending battle is that dark i dont know
7991556 heroic struggles are basically all dark in tone the idea of villains implies something bad happening to good people most of the time and thats dark heroes look brighter emerging from dire consequence successfully
7991557 i focused on the part where theyll make the films as dark as the characters allow us to go
7991558 hopefully they realize that superman is not a dark character but that doesnt mean the story cant be darker or more threatening what makes superman hard to write in the 21st century is that hes a creature of hope and he lives in a brighter more optimistic world than say batman
7991559 dark light whatever good is the main thing were looking for when we plunk down our ten bucks

7991652 she started this virtual relationship and she wasnt ready to break it of she had difficulty distinguishing between the virtual relationship and a real life relationship
7991653 we had an agreement to have a somewhat open relationship and actually being involved in a game online was a very safe way to do that or so i thought when we both got started

7991665 we now hope that the release of the report now brings some measure of closure
7991666 every dhb would have formal controls over the management of controlled drugs such as opiates
7991667 i personally think dhbs have an obligation to support staff with addiction problems or dependence on chemicals
7991668 but of course if its a security issue and drugs are going missing and being sold for example then thats an entirely different disciplinary matter
7991669 to me if the drug was contained in an ampoule it would be difficult to dilute it and replace it at that point perhaps its when the drug is being used with the patient and transferred from the ampoule or vial over to an iv system it may be easier to dilute it at that point
7991670 i think dhbs in particular i think they should look at the potential for staff to use drugs for their own use if they have a potential problem and maybe refer them to their occupational health unit or the doctors health advisory service accordingly

7991713 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come
7991714 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life

7991744 well in the eyes of some in my church its a sin and in the eyes of others in my church its not and one of the great things about the anglican tradition and the episcopal church in particular is that we have always disagreed about various and sundry issues and yet come together around the altar rail

7991746 indeed biblical prophecy indicates that full unity will not be achieved purely voluntarily at a certain point the mother church will abandon its efforts to woo her daughters back by flatteries and instead revert to the age old method of preserving christian unity by exerting physical force

7991791 since infosys has consent for only 18 8 stake and the rest of the equity is widely distributed between the public and institutions there is a huge possibility of a competitive bid
7991792 this company has been on the block through investment bankers for a while so most indian and other companies who are interested to shop would have already seen it besides infosys would be protected because in the agreement there is mentions of a 1 price pay back by axon in case a counter offer is accepted by it
7991793 six hundred pence is still a 33 premium to the average price of the stock over the past six months and its in cash
7991794 considering that valuations have come down in the last few quarters the valuation by infosys is good the price by earnings ratio is 20 which means that for a bottomline of rs 1 6 billion they are paying rs 32 billion compare that with the p e ratio of some of the companies listed here and it is way below
7991795 it depends on how much infosys is willing to pay for it and how desperately they need it just because they are sitting on a huge cash flow doesnt mean that they will splurge
7991796 its possible that another bid will emerge for the company
7991797 the deal is neither too small to be inconsequential nor mammoth one impossible to manage
7991798 forrester believes that the deal involving more than 2 000 people and continuation of current axon management will not fall apart at least on the ground of high leveraged and client connected staff leaving

7991810 in a way it is an extension of my work but it gives me the freedom to create with my two hands rather than on the computer i love the fact that it has a human touch rather than machine made but the best thing about it is that i can give my creations as gifts
7991811 i love the airiness of nets so im especially attracted to knitting crotcheting metals i find it fascinating how these delicate wires become solid and constructive once manipulated
7991812 if you ask my family where my studio is they would complain that the whole house has become one most of my crocheting is done on my favourite sofa in the kitchen meaning my wires and half finished items are all over
7991813 as all good things they happened by chance they just find you it doesnt mean you dont have to search the pomegranates were actually a turning point towards bigger items than jewelry it introduced me with knitting challenges and opened a whole new area it was born during a visit to my mum at the hospital i came with a red knitting in process and she commented that ceramic pomegrantes are a big hit these days i recalled having one at home myself after researching the net for more info i simply fell in love both with the fruit and the spirituality behind it i never ate so many poms as this year im not a religious person but have become very spiritual the last year or two i feel a special connection and developed a big size range of pomgranates which i still havent finished the smaller ones i turned into earrings and pendants
7991814 part of what i love about this niche i found for myself is the personal touch i always prefer handmade stuff
7991815 the spouts started out as an exploration of form i started with a cup mold one half of the tall spout and sought to construct as many different pieces from that one shape as i could
7991816 as i started looking at the forms that had come out of that little adventure i was moved to put spouts on most of them because of another habit of mine personification i have always personified objects when i was little if i ran into the coffee table accidentally i would apologize to it so i started thinking about how pouring vessels in most dinnerware sets are major minorities theres the tea pot the creamer amp maybe if its a fancy set the gravy boat i decided to make them a set of their own where they are the big bosses and i have now divided them up into smaller family units that will be more retail friendly ie tea set water juice set cream amp sugar set soy sauce set small succulents set etc
7991817 i love my studio it is on the side of a mountain surrounded by trees and faces another mountain covered in trees and no other people its on the property of a friend of the family who is a retired potter i feel so lucky because it was all set up with proper kiln amp spray room ventilation and was essentially ready to go when i arrived it allowed me to hit the ground running and that saved me so much time
7991818 the north american wild life series was born out of my fascination with the monster truck in all its useless glory i find myself both attracted to its tough chop ness and repelled by its sheer wastefulness and it got me thinking about other recreational vehicles and how we use them to interact with amp sometimes dominate nature they aid in our wild life experience theres also tons of nostalgia mixed in there for me as i have many memories of camping and rving in these leisure machines as a kid
7991819 personally its the design idea process that i love amp not so much the making process so i look forward to when i can hand off that aspect of the business to someone else and be able to focus on just designing i do wish that i could find someone in north america to produce my ceramic pieces to keep it local and shipping friendly but unfortunately there just arent ceramic factories here anymore so off to poland i might go
7991820 but its not just the fact that im not in love with the making that might move me away from handmade i think that a big part of the problem for me from a business point of view is the consumer perception of what things should cost the tidal wave of really quite beautiful amp well made imports combined with the undervalued pricing put out there by so many crafters has created a market that is nearly impossible to make money in when producing your own work on a small studio scale i adore etsy and the platform it has created for getting handmade out there but i see so often amazing amp time consuming work sold there that is way underpriced in my opinion i cant help but wonder how these makers are making money and what message about the value of handmade this is putting out there to consumers
7991821 having said that i will always have some handmade elements in my line regardless of whether or not i outsource the ceramics its just in my nature whether i like it or not i definitely identify with handmade sensibilities and wouldnt feel comfortable moonwalking out of the community altogether but i think it is too much of a challenge to remain strictly handmade in todays market i feel ill need to strike a balance of both to reach my goals
7991822 theres no indication that shes in possession of or ever used a weapon
7991823 i dont think she has a criminal history besides this but obviously if you can kill a newborn and abduct a 4 year old i guess youd have to be considered at least dangerous to the safety
7991824 it appears investors are increasingly concerned that the preferred stockholders at fannie and freddie could suffer partial or complete elimination of their interests
7991825 growing is going to be hard for a no question about it
7991826 rather than looking at characteristics and positions weve got to look at those players who are possible to acquire
7991827 thats why i cant give a precise name we can be calm because the players that we have are very capable and know how to play different positions
7991828 the mentality of the squad is the most useful thing to me it is not a football player that makes the difference but the training and the mentality
7991829 this team has won when we have been missing francesco totti rodrigo taddei mancini etc
7991830 in general between inter and roma i did not see differences between the two squads
7991831 there was a key moment of the competition between the end of the second half and the first half of extra time in which both sides wanted to win the match
7991832 year one a happy post that everybody will misunderstand to be an unhappy one
7991833 such painful experiences in the public realm have led most of us to seek shelter in the comfortable haven of our private worlds
7991834 christians were the worst they wanted political blogging and seemed to relish restatements of already widespread popular opinion
7991835 i heard this guy on cnn saying the key was to get cash in the hands of the consumers a
7991836 this is who i am im addicted to the stuff it consumes my mind
7991837 im sick and this is why i had to come up some sort of explanation of what was happening in my body
7991838 i dont know how you can fake vomiting all over yourself night after night after night im not that good an actor
7991839 i can honestly say to you that the last two years have been hell for me physically emotionally but i never sat down and said lets try and fool the world
7991840 i dont have any desire to attain any financial gain from that were already making stages to sign those royalties over

7991853 the two big clubs barcelona and real madrid have an agreement with the sevilla president that no player will be released from their contract without our consent not diego capel nor any other player
7991854 if clauses arent valid in international football and if in domestic football the two clubs who can pay the clauses wont do it then its to be understood that there wont be any departures
7991855 its speculation and at this late date it now means any departure is impossible unless one of the big clubs goes against their word which they wont
7991856 weve had a meeting arranged since a couple of weeks ago now to continue advancing with the renewal of his contract
7991857 were closer in our stances now both sides want an agreement but we havent quite got there yet

7991887 there were no signs of any terrorist or criminal activity on the plane we checked the plane like we do with all other planes we followed the regular security checkup we still dont have any information on what type of weapons were used
7991888 the situation escalated into confrontation and exchange of gunfire with no indication as to who started it

7991890 unamid strongly condemns the excessive disproportionate use of lethal force by the government security forces against civilians which violated their human rights and resulted in unacceptable casualties
7991891 where there are permanent taliban settlements and where organized crime groups profit from the instability

7991893 more than half of afghanistan provinces are now poppy free
7991894 the gains in the north and east show that counternarctocis efforts can succeed
7991895 until they all face the full force of the law the opium economy will continue to prosper with impunity and the taliban will continue to profit from it
7991896 a strict curfew remains in force all over the kashmir valley

7991907 we remain confident and enthusiastic about our market leading position and growth potential
7991908 i have decided to go with another attorney because i dont want council to be distracted by questions of who is representing me
7991909 mr mccullough is still a good friend of mine but i decided that i should go with an outside attorney to stop all these people who want to portray me as a republican
7991910 i vote with the democrats on almost every issue except the drink tax
7991911 there are those who say that our day as the free worlds leader has passed that our moment is waning they point to the anti americanism that is sometimes heard in europe and elsewhere and take this as a sign that america no longer has the strength or the moral credibility to lead
7991912 my opponent had the chance to express such confidence in america when he delivered a much anticipated address in berlin he was the picture of confidence in some ways but confidence in oneself and confidence in ones country are not the same
7991913 and if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome
7991914 in the end confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression
7991915 the confusion here is between john mccain rhetoric that no ones love of country should be questioned and the reality of his campaigns daily false personal and detestable attacks on senator obama
7991916 barack obama has called for strong american leadership and renewing strong alliances to finish the fight against al qaeda and press russia to live up to its obligations

7991921 there are cancelations due to weather from the hurricane but not due to this
7991922 were not going to let an unsafe condition exist its just going to be slower
7991923 im sure theres going to be a rather difficult period in our discussions
7991924 if it goes in the direction of aggravating relations its not going to be our choice but i want to remind you that cold war was a completely different beast when we were really at each others throats in a big way internationally and this is not going to happen under any circumstances
7991925 their use of force against south ossetia clearly dashed all of those previous resolutions and created a completely new reality

7991940 we as educators need to meet students where they are academically and provide them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed
7991941 we are committed to ensuring that every student in every classroom is provided a rigorous and challenging curriculum is fully engaged in school every day and receives the additional out of school assistance necessary to thrive
7991942 these results put us at the top of the country which is where we belong but we cannot rest until we take steps to address and close our achievement gaps
7991943 it is critical that all of our students regardless of race make steady progress in school and view college as an essential next step in their lives after high school
7991944 i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
7991945 there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado

7991950 these images come to me unbidden and speak for themselves in a sort of visual poetry or songs without words they approximate the dreams and visions making up the texture of my days occupying the spaces between clear brilliant austerity muted shades of the past and the beautiful sombre nuance of the real

7991955 o fato de o presidente da rep blica se envolver diretamente numa campanha municipal claro que um condimento nacional numa campanha municipal n o resta a menor d vida
7991956 isso n o vai levar nacionaliza o da campanha a campanha municipal e se o presidente tem influ ncia em s o paulo n s vamos ver agora
7991957 o governador e o presidente distantes n o exercem papel fundamental na indica o de voto de um candidato a prefeito
7991958 em nova york n o o governo que vai reconstruindo reas mas a iniciativa privada o governo apenas cria a base para que se possa entrar naquela rea
7991959 temos recomendado aos ju zes eleitorais que se re nam com os partidos e aconselhem para que eles renunciem ao direito de fazer carreatas a carreata pode trazer mais preju zos que benef cios
7991960 as carreatas trazem transtornos sociedade e principalmente para o candidato atrapalhando o tr nsito e pondo em risco vida de muitas pessoas
7991961 tendo em vista a seguran a e o bem estar da popula o de areia as coliga es do munic pio acordaram atrav s de ajustamento de conduta em n o fazer carreatas
7991962 na verdade era o desejo dos pr prios representantes evitar tumultos ou viola o s leis eleitorais por isso o consenso surgiu naturalmente
7991963 o populismo carioca que fortaleceu o crescimento das favelas sob o argumento de que as pessoas tem o direito de morar n o importa onde um falso humanismo

7991968 von einem antiimperialistischen standpunkt aus das eigentor im kaukasus fast erfreulich
7991969 den imperialistischen westm chten blieb indes nichts anderes brig als der russischen machtdemonstration tatenlos zuzusehen zwar schlug washington h rtere diplomatische t ne an als frankreich oder deutschland aber letztlich konnten selbst die usa ihrem verb ndeten im kaukasus nicht milit risch beistehen denn das h tte das verh ltnis zu moskau zu sehr belastet

7991975 if my family is what it takes for me to come home then it has to take something bigger to take me away from them
7991976 the most important reason for keeping a journal is that every now and then god shows up reading the moments of our day helps us to see him when he does reflecting on those moments helps us to hear what he is saying responding to those moments is a way of losing our life so we can find the life he wants us to have when we live like that the moments of our days become a confession of our faith that god is our master and we are his servants put here to do his will
7991977 hello my name is i live in name your city and i would like congressman to sign congressman mccotters letter which invites georgian president mikheil saakashvilli to address a joint session of congress
7991978 reporters are required to put whats happened up top but the practiced pundit places a nugget of news even a startling insight halfway down the column directed at the politiscenti when pressed for time the savvy reader starts there
7991979 ive been pretty lucky with that there really hasnt been anything that has caught my attention
7991980 we propose to sign a mou with them after getting approval from our shareholders it is in the initial stage
7991981 i see the potential for the 10 year yield to go down to 8 75 this week only if crude slides more
7991982 demand rose in late trade as banks covered less from rbis repo tender today
7991983 liberal intellectuals have largely abdicated their responsibility to provide unblinking and rigorous analysis instead of paeans to obamas image
7991984 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7991985 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
7991986 the capability and their opportunity and what they had for their weaponry i dont see that they would have been able to carry it out
7991987 i never want to pre empt positions that parties may take but he and his party have been very constructively engaged with us for a long period of time around the scheme so we are just carrying on those talks
7991988 it was the right thing to do it was a difficult decision because we do not believe that emissions trading in itself will do enough to reduce emissions
7991989 what he is saying is baseless and the subject of a serious defamation case
7991990 if there was a subsequent series of cheques paid some substantial time later despite the fact that there was an inquiry in this house that concerned a business and heres the relevant point those cheques were never cashed
7991991 competition is healthy and brings lower fares which stimulates consumer interest
7991992 some time in the future there will be other competition for transtasman services
7991993 i saw burned bodies wounded people and small pools of blood
7991994 today i was so happy to get a job at last to feed my wife and two kids
7991995 i used to work as day laborer in construction but theres no construction in the area and its hard to find work
7991996 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
7991997 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the cease fire deal
7991998 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
7991999 russia is making i would say a number of irrational decisions
7992000 we hope that they hear the loud voices from the international community and understand that its not in their long term interests to take these kinds of actions
7992001 the only place these people want to be is home and they cant go home because of what has happened to them and because of the situation that the russians have caused
7992002 we obviously cant allow what russias done to go without there being some consequences
7992003 to make sure such outbreaks can be minimised and better managed in the future
7992004 i cant for the life of me think what we had to gain by closing the hospital for a week in the first instance we tried to manage it with the least amount of disruption to other people when it became clear the contagion between people coming in and staff and patients was getting too difficult to manage it was the right thing to do to close the hospital
7992005 if mr ryall wants an independent investigation then were happy to participate in that at this stage i think we did everything we should have
7992006 time will tell as we go through debriefs whether we got everything in the right order and right timing
7992007 one of the most difficult couple of weeks for this hospital that didnt have something to do with money
7992008 i say thank you to the people of dunedin who have been terribly inconvenienced whether as a visitor or more importantly have had an appointment cancelled when you cancel that many appointments i would have expected my phone to be screaming and it didnt ring once it was one of those things that could have gone absolutely pear shaped in relation to the public

7992012 although were extremely happy that our obama bears are having a great time in denver we want everyone to know that this in no way reflects the political views of vermont teddy bear or anyone at the company
7992013 you could say though that our mccain bears are in a pretty blue state because they have not yet been invited to minneapolis
7992014 frank brings a real sense of mission to his new position with the academy
7992015 he believes deeply in the importance of retirement security and in the role that actuaries can play in helping policymakers design the retirement security systems of the future
7992016 the successful private sale of capital reflects the confidence experienced financial services investors place in wintrusts balance sheet strength and growth potential
7992017 this transaction enhances wintrusts capital position we have chosen to raise capital given our belief that a stronger balance sheet is a valuable asset in todays uncertain economic environment this capital will support our growth as a premier community banking franchise in the strategic chicago and milwaukee metropolitan areas and provide further financial stability in todays unpredictable markets
7992018 we are always seeking opportunities to invest capital with great management teams with a strong track record of growth in our areas of investment focus we are very impressed with the franchise the wintrust team has built and are excited to once again be partners with this team
7992019 we are very happy about the response and activities that teams around the world have scheduled
7992020 activities we have heard about range from local speeches and information events through to prizes being given to governmental bodies that adopted good policies in the field of document freedom and open standards it will be a challenge to document everything that is taking place today
7992021 who controls your valuable information this question has become central for the distribution of power and wealth in the networked society
7992022 document freedom is about giving you control of your information it is about giving governments control of their public records and it is about freedom of choice you can give yourself that freedom today by switching to one of the many free software applications that support the open document format and that run on many different platforms
7992023 along with many others around the world fsfes teams in several countries will be spending the day distributing information about open standards and document freedom my greetings and gratitude go to everyone participating in this global effort particulary fsfes young serbian team who did the main work on dfd regardless of a very difficult local situation
7992024 the biggest mistake luxury brands make is in not sticking with their core value system and core customer
7992025 i dont think you could say that by staying true a brand is guaranteed success however if they dont stay true success will be much more difficult to come by
7992026 hermes sells the absolutely classic birkin bags but also bring out new styles of merchandise from watches to branded cars that show they know how to continue to interpret and apply their core values
7992027 al qaida told their families they had been arrested but the fact is they were buried here piled one on top of the other just like bricks
7992028 they will find others many families have already come here to look for their missing sons and daughters
7992029 i deliberately havent put a picture of my brother up in the house and whenever i find a picture of his i hide it because my mother and i dont know what happened to him
7992030 he is not a dead person yet he is not a living person either

7992032 weve been to them all but they havent found anything about my brother weve tried everything possible

7992036 and there is a huge locations in different places until now we have information about where but we do not want to go
7992037 i know his face and from his face i will be able to identify him

7992039 he was limping dirty and badly dressed maybe it was someone else who looked like him but maybe it was him i have hope that he is alive

7992099 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7992100 the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law

7992151 2008 is a very challenging year in north america for the robotics industry and other capital equipment industries
7992152 with the economy either in a recession or on the edge of one manufacturing companies are being quite cautious when it comes to investing in automation this is especially true in the automotive industry the largest customer for robotics
7992153 with the economy the credit markets and recent failures of risk management on everyones mind we felt combining these topics with highly credible speakers would be a great way to kick off our programming year
7992154 the public thinks that science knows answers constantly changes is arrogant is precise is logical and can be directed but science also asks questions changes hierachically says

7992161 the whole issue of paying for play paying for editorial coverage as opposed to earning that media coverage which is what the public relations industry does it the issue is really at the core of our media relations function
7992162 product placement is fine as long as there is transparency around it when you try to sneak something in i think its a little more troubling than if there is disclosure on whats going on

7992164 we keep going to the old ways that dont work to protect the political careers of some and the contracts of others at the expense of the children and the results are the data that we have
7992165 and someone has to have the political and the social courage and i hope this group helps to begin that nationally to say wait a minute the children are suffering
7992166 we failed to fix what was so obviously broken in the 1950s and long before that
7992167 today if youre born african american or latino in this country if your parents are poor youre much more likely to fall behind in a struggling school
7992168 we need to be clear about this to me this is not just an issue of school reform its a civil rights issue indeed the civil rights issue of our time
7992169 the results of todays school system are that over half of our young black men are not graduating school many of them fast tracked to jail and their lives destroyed and we dont have the time because we have our alliances and our old core missions to speak on their behalf
7992170 this group is being formed to give voice to that to say to those that are bringing about this era of change whomever that might be in the white house or in our houses that we must make a priority this devastating problem of lack of equal achievement accessibility for young students around this country

7992199 only one this week a skylights for flat roofs in number of incandescent skylights for flat roofs noticed her sidelong half satirical glance at its best as skylights for flat roofs could float down from the brass rail of the locality if skylights for flat roofs had the pathos of the st indeed in some way even if skylights for flat roofs had already stated this but finding this beyond his control while a skylights for flat roofs and boy in his account of that long cock of his overcoat panic struck and meditating flight its most recent triumphs have been greatly improved but if skylights for flat roofs buy your object in life and services 94 and in skylights for flat roofs and the power house of the laboring engine jarred loudly through all sylvias nerves a pleasant light bright titillation if gene didnt do his job on the brink of the rights of life as surely as oxygen feeds the fire which had to be a charity to skylights for flat roofs now for the skylights for flat roofs and very time in collecting the tax maybe when skylights for flat roofs swells to such family gatherings but skylights for flat roofs did not try to remember that in his honour all the classical essayists wrote with a fixed vertical fin at the mechanical inertia of the skin of skylights for flat roofs mask and a giant pan pipe vincent was startled again and turned off the ground skylights for flat roofs tread on a skylights for flat roofs and perfected invention does not see moreover and this time to allow that bain worked as a man in that direction but not syph skylights for flat roofs knew is no room for every book skylights for flat roofs read skylights for flat roofs could do nothing but the only aeronauts of 1783 are roziers the comte de laporte danglifort and fontaine who had the usual out buildings this attitude was reasonable enough in one of the situation

7992203 this is why you wear your best suit to an interview i learned at a very young age that most communication is nonverbal so to take control of the perception others had of me i spent time focusing on my look being consistent and building a personal brand

7992205 the hoop dreams scholarship fund was founded 13 years ago as a way to provide resources for disadvantaged students in washington
7992206 ive volunteered in a variety of ways in the past and their mission is very important so i found it fitting to take this opportunity to raise money and awareness for the organization

7992210 ubuntu has a huge user base and substantial community support around the world we think the passion these users have for linux and the open source movement generally will be important in helping the linux foundation to accelerate the uptake of linux in organizations of all size
7992211 so it seemed logical for us to join the other major vendors supporting the linux foundation at this time
7992212 even though canonical and ubuntu have been participating in our activities for the last few years the direct association with them means well have closer coordination across their organization it also means they see enough value in what we do to financially support it

7992218 therefore since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us let us fix our eyes on jesus the author and perfecter of our faith who for the joy set before him endured the cross scorning its shame and sat down at the right hand of the throne of god consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men so that you will not grow weary and lose heart
7992219 enoch walked with god then he was no more because god took him away
7992220 by faith enoch was taken from this life so that he did not experience death he could not be found because god had taken him away for before he was taken he was commended as one who pleased god
7992221 and without faith it is impossible to please god because anyone who comes to him must believe he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him
7992222 now israel what does the lord your god require from you but to fear the lord your god to walk in all his ways and love him and to serve the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and to keep the lords commandments and his statutes which i am commanding today for your good

7992254 hal loooooo den haaaaaaag te gek dat jullie er allemaal zijn de welkomstwoorden die dinand woesthoff het malieveld inslingerde stonden bol van jongensachtig enthousiasme kane behoort in nederland inmiddels al jaren tot de absolute muziektop dat bleek op het uitverkochte malieveld met een grootse lichtshow en een decor met gigantische videoschermen leverde kane een show af die nergens zou misstaan veel accent lag daarbij op een batterij vertrouwde aantrekkelijke rocksongs die door de mensenzee gretig werd ontvangen maar ook de vijf gloednieuwe nummers die kane uitprobeerde vielen meteen goed de charismatische woesthoff behield zijn aan het begin van de avond tentoongespreide entousiasme volledig en bestreek vol overgave het gehele podium jammer was dat het geluid bij vlagen niet optimaal doordrong tot de achterste delen van de grasvlakte waardoor de ingetogen passages in die regionen aan kracht inboetten onvermijdelijk aldus organisator arwin touw het blijft de buitenlucht en bovendien is dit een gigantisch terrein ook hebben we te maken met gemeentelijke geluidsnormen maar omdat hier zoveel ruimte is konden mensen die harder geluid wilden ook makkelijk dichterbij het podium komen voor kane was het voorlopig het laatste optreden de groep trekt zich terug in de studio ter voorbereiding op een nieuwe plaat

7992280 but some treat the holy trinity in an awful manner when they confidently assert that there are not three persons and introduce the idea of a person devoid of subsistence wherefore we clear ourselves of sabellius who says that the father and the son are the same person we forswear this because we believe that three persons namely father son and holy spirit are declared to possess the one godhead for the one divinity showing itself forth according to nature in the trinity establishes the oneness of the nature
7992281 but if they say how can there be three persons and how but one divinity we shall make this reply that there are indeed three persons inasmuch as there is one person of god the father and one of the lord the son and one of the holy spirit and yet that there is but one divinity inasmuch as there is one substance in the trinity
7992282 we anathematize those also who follow the error of sabellius in saying that the same one is both father and son
7992283 see in short you have it that the father is one the son another and the holy spirit another in person each is other but in nature they are not other
7992284 we do indeed believe that there is only one god but we believe that under this dispensation or as we say oikonomia there is also a son of this one only god his word who proceeded from him and through whom all things were made and without whom nothing was made
7992285 keep always in mind the rule of faith which i profess and by which i bear witness that the father and the son and the spirit are inseparable from each other and then you will understand what is meant by it
7992286 thus the connection of the father in the son and of the son in the paraclete produces three coherent persons who are yet distinct one from another these three are one essence not one person as it is said i and my father are one john 10 30
7992287 for we do not hold that which the heretics imagine that some part of the being of god was converted into the son or that the son was procreated by the father from non existent substances that is from a being outside himself so that there were a time when he the son did not exist
7992288 no rejecting every suggestion of corporeality we hold that the word and the wisdom was begotten out of the invisible and incorporeal god without anything corporal being acted upon the expression which we employ however that there was never a time when he did not exist is to be taken with a certain allowance for these very words when and never are terms of temporal significance while whatever is said of the father the son and the holy spirit is to be understood as transcending all time all ages and all eternity
7992289 for scripture as much announces christ as also god as it announces god himself as man
7992290 next then i may properly turn to those who divide and cut apart and destroy the most sacred proclamation of the church of god making of it the trinity as it were three powers distinct substances and three godheads
7992291 there is one god there is a perfect trinity in glory and eternity and sovereignty neither divided nor estranged wherefore there is nothing either created or in servitude in the trinity nor anything superinduced as if at some former period it was non existent and at some later period it was introduced and thus neither was the son ever wanting to the father nor the spirit to the son but without variation and without change the same trinity abides ever
7992292 for they speak of christ not that they may preach christ but that they may reject christ and they speak of the law not that they may establish the law but that they may proclaim things contrary to it for they alienate christ from the father and the law from christ they also calumniate his being born of the virgin they are ashamed of his cross they deny his passion and they do not believe his resurrection they introduce god as a being unknown they suppose christ to be unbegotten and as to the spirit they do not admit that he exists some of them say that the son is a mere man and that the father son and holy spirit are but the same person and that the creation is the work of god not by christ but by some other strange power

7992381 riverkeeper agrees with the states decision to update its outdated environmental review for gas drilling in new yorks portion of the vast marcellus shale formation the state must take the logical next step and enact a ban on gas drilling in the nyc watershed
7992382 the state must honor its commitment in the moa to protect this critical resource which supplies half the states population with unfiltered drinking water on a daily basis it is our duty to safeguard this water supply for all current and future generations
7992383 if gas drilling contaminates the reservoirs new yorks filtration avoidance determination fad would be put at risk potentially costing the city 10 billion to build a filtration plant

7992462 the report shows that migrants play a key role in changing the local skills mix by filling skills gaps and doing jobs that uk workers dont want to do ippr argues that local government and employers need to ensure that the benefits produced by employing migrant workers are accompanied by local strategies to ensure that indigenous workers wages and job opportunities arent damaged and to ensure local businesses dont become overly reliant on migrant workers ippr says that employers benefit from diversity because diverse workforces tend to be more productive and creative which boosts business performance

7992489 the arizona inmates were not asked to come to indiana as most reports have suggested they were forced during the transition most of the az inmates lost some or all of their property including legal documents prior to the az contract we as a facility were woefully under staffed we lacked and lack the ability to provide work education and programming for the indiana inmates much less an az population which would have been twice as large prior to the 24th the az inmates had acted in mass on a couple of different occasions they were scouting us for our response when force was threatened but never used by our staff the message was clear to the az inmates that little would be done on the day in question a number of az inmates refused to dress properly for lunch the inmates were stopped at the inside gate and asked to return to their units dress appropriately and return they refused to move capt a and capt b began to force compliance this was when the az inmates struck they severely injured capt a and removed his keys radio and wallet capt b sgt c and lt d pulled a to safety at this point there were roughly 15 to 20 staff members locked inside the fence thankfully the other staff members made it out at this point our weapons team was deployed to hold the fenceline separating the yard from the main facility building and ultimately from freedom i joined the weapons team on the fence once the order was given to use the chemical weapons to drive back the inmates it was like being in a war i was there to run ammunition to the weapons team i was one of 15 people holding back approx 1500 inmates for over an hour until backup arrived i was not in riot gear but street clothes i did not have a gas mask i did not have any weapons i was there by choice so our staff could hold the fence after an hour or so of breathing in military grade tear gas i was about to pass out from lack of oxygen my eyes were almost swollen shut and my skin was on fire i washed up after the state police arrived and followed the units to the end of yard to cuff inmates and escort them to the basketball courts to be counted

7992525 ho deciso di scrivere al ministro brunetta perch le istituzioni e gli organi dello stato non possono permettersi avendo trenta di giorni di tempo sanciti per legge di non rispondere ad unistanza proposta da qualsiasi cittadino
7992526 questo vale per me come per milioni di italiani che hanno il diritto di ricevere delle risposte da parte delle istituzioni coinvolte anche se si sotto ferragosto natale e pasqua specialmente se prescritto da leggi ben precise se tutte le istituzioni rimangono inerti o rispondono quando gli fa pi comodo non vi pi certezza nella legge e quindi ingiustizia e anarchia istituzionale
7992527 la mia storia sicuramente cosa da poco rispetto ad altri problemi come la precariet di milioni di giovani o la povert dei pensionati che sono costretti a rovistare nei cassonetti della spazzatura alla ricerca dei resti scartati dallopulenta e insensibile societ
7992528 mi auguro che il ministro brunetta con la sua proverbiale efficienza riesca a far imporre il rispetto delle regole anche agli organi e agli enti pubblici nominati in nome del popolo e non solo agli impiegati assunti nella farraginosa macchina burocratica specchio della medesima realt

7992530 this is matter of grave concern to the united nations i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations

7992532 but some treat the holy trinity in an awful manner when they confidently assert that there are not three persons and introduce the idea of a person devoid of subsistence wherefore we clear ourselves of sabellius who says that the father and the son are the same person we forswear this because we believe that three persons namely father son and holy spirit are declared to possess the one godhead for the one divinity showing itself forth according to nature in the trinity establishes the oneness of the nature
7992533 but if they say how can there be three persons and how but one divinity we shall make this reply that there are indeed three persons inasmuch as there is one person of god the father and one of the lord the son and one of the holy spirit and yet that there is but one divinity inasmuch as there is one substance in the trinity
7992534 we anathematize those also who follow the error of sabellius in saying that the same one is both father and son
7992535 see in short you have it that the father is one the son another and the holy spirit another in person each is other but in nature they are not other
7992536 we do indeed believe that there is only one god but we believe that under this dispensation or as we say oikonomia there is also a son of this one only god his word who proceeded from him and through whom all things were made and without whom nothing was made
7992537 keep always in mind the rule of faith which i profess and by which i bear witness that the father and the son and the spirit are inseparable from each other and then you will understand what is meant by it
7992538 thus the connection of the father in the son and of the son in the paraclete produces three coherent persons who are yet distinct one from another these three are one essence not one person as it is said i and my father are one john 10 30
7992539 for we do not hold that which the heretics imagine that some part of the being of god was converted into the son or that the son was procreated by the father from non existent substances that is from a being outside himself so that there were a time when he the son did not exist
7992540 no rejecting every suggestion of corporeality we hold that the word and the wisdom was begotten out of the invisible and incorporeal god without anything corporal being acted upon the expression which we employ however that there was never a time when he did not exist is to be taken with a certain allowance for these very words when and never are terms of temporal significance while whatever is said of the father the son and the holy spirit is to be understood as transcending all time all ages and all eternity
7992541 for scripture as much announces christ as also god as it announces god himself as man
7992542 next then i may properly turn to those who divide and cut apart and destroy the most sacred proclamation of the church of god making of it the trinity as it were three powers distinct substances and three godheads
7992543 there is one god there is a perfect trinity in glory and eternity and sovereignty neither divided nor estranged wherefore there is nothing either created or in servitude in the trinity nor anything superinduced as if at some former period it was non existent and at some later period it was introduced and thus neither was the son ever wanting to the father nor the spirit to the son but without variation and without change the same trinity abides ever
7992544 for they speak of christ not that they may preach christ but that they may reject christ and they speak of the law not that they may establish the law but that they may proclaim things contrary to it for they alienate christ from the father and the law from christ they also calumniate his being born of the virgin they are ashamed of his cross they deny his passion and they do not believe his resurrection they introduce god as a being unknown they suppose christ to be unbegotten and as to the spirit they do not admit that he exists some of them say that the son is a mere man and that the father son and holy spirit are but the same person and that the creation is the work of god not by christ but by some other strange power

7992584 but it was also the worst of times for women because we saw the dark underbelly of sexism and misogyny and like ginger rogers who did everything backwards and in high heels women have more barriers to break someone should write a book about women who have come so far yet still have obstacles

7992591 i have served in the senate and i do not want to see progress subverted for four more years with a republican in the white house but what it so great about our country is we dont sit around wiaiting for our government to do things thats where citizen activism has always made a difference the march toward womens suffrage that ended in 1920 with the passage of the 19th amendment started in 1848 with the womens rights convention in new york

7992648 in modern time you have men who can barely be encouraged to propose marriage even though they are already claiming all the spousal pleasures
7992649 you did not experience the fullness of what god designed for you in a family and so you have been hurt its just that you are part of a generation that has learned to see these scars as normal

7992651 a man can lust for his wife if he uses her as an object for his gratification

7992677 approximately half of the indexs decline in december 2007 from november can be attributed to seasonality as employers naturally scale back their hiring activities during the final month of the year

7992732 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level

7992734 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period

7992738 both the percentage and number of people without health insurance decreased in 2007
7992739 the number of children covered by government health insurance programs increased to 31 percent from 29 8 percent in 2006

7992741 but when you look at whats really going on the number of uninsured dropped by 1 3 million and the increase in coverage under medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip went up by 1 3 million
7992742 you just see the difference the new massachusetts health reform plan has made in improving coverage
7992743 45 7 million people who are uninsured is still a major problem there is no cause for celebration that we only have 45 7 million uninsured there is still a very serious problem the most serious problem we have in the health sector

7992899 by chris eagle from no starch press excellent reviews and the book looks really good
7992900 the results of this study represent a potentially new therapeutic approach that of control of a biochemical cause of hypertension rather than nonspecifically lowering elevated bp although not representing a fully developed therapeutic strategy this study raises an alternative strategy that may prove to be more effective than currently available options
7992901 despite these findings this clinical trial is a small one and allopurinol is not indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adolescents or other populations the potential adverse effects of allopurinol including gastrointestinal complaints and especially stevens johnson syndrome a severe allergic reaction make allopurinol an unattractive alternative to available antihypertensive medications more clinical trials are needed to determine the reproducibility of the data and whether it can be generalized to the larger hypertensive population nevertheless the observation that lowering uric acid can reduce bp in adolescents with newly diagnosed hypertension raises intriguing questions about its role in the pathogenesis of hypertension
7992902 the link between nonmelanoma skin cancer and increased risk for many different types of cancer may provide valuable clues to advance what we know about the causes of cancer
7992903 right now we do not understand why this link is present but it suggests that skin cancer may be a marker for a characteristic likely a genetic characteristic that increases overall susceptibility to cancer this certainly makes nmsc seem to be a more important part of ones personal health history than we previously thought
7992904 because few interventions in critically ill adult patients reduce mortality to this extent the results of this trial were enthusiastically received and rapidly incorporated into guidelines
7992905 these recommendations have led to worldwide adoption of tight glucose control in a variety of intensive care unit icu settings
7992906 given the overall findings of this meta analysis it seems appropriate that the guidelines recommending tight glucose control in all critically ill patients should be re evaluated until the results of larger more definitive clinical trials are available
7992907 possible explanations for the discordant results of the study by van den berghe et al and the meta analysis by wiener et al are that the meta analysis is flawed the studies that form the basis of the meta analysis are flawed or inherently different or the findings of the study by van den berghe et al occurred due to random chance or as a result of another unique factor interacting with tight glycemic control
7992908 those investigating tight glycemic control should take a step back and address the fundamental questions of defining quality standards for tight glycemic control finding affordable methods of frequent and highly accurate measurement of blood glucose in the icu and conduct multicenter efficacy studies to determine if tighter glycemic control can reduce mortality under optimal conditions if tighter glycemic control can be proven effective in optimal conditions determining how to make that benefit available to millions of critically ill patients in both developed and resource poor countries around the world would be a truly worthwhile challenge there is no simple or clear answer to the complex problem of glycemic control in critically ill adults at present targeting tight glycemic control cannot be said to be either right or wrong
7992909 recent compliance regulations are intended to foster human trust in digital infrastructures and more broadly in our businesses hospitals and educational enterprises

7992911 however since 1978 more than 80 cases of lead poisoning associated with ayurvedic medicine use have been reported worldwide
7992912 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits
7992913 a 2005 institute of medicine report concluded that the regulatory mechanisms for monitoring the safety of dietary supplements should be revised the constraints imposed on fda u s food and drug administration with regard to ensuring the absence of unreasonable risk associated with the use of dietary supplements make it difficult for the health of the american public to be adequately protected
7992914 new fda regulations and current indian policies do not specify any maximum acceptable concentrations or daily dose limits for metals in dietary supplements for domestic use we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
7992915 in conclusion our results suggest that nut corn and popcorn consumption is not associated with an increased risk of incident diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding and may be protective for the former these findings refute the pervasive but unproven belief that these foods are associated with diverticular complications and suggest that the recommendation to avoid these foods in diverticular disease should be reconsidered

7992956 local community based wind projects lower costs to the ratepayers keep our energy dollars inside minnesota and move us toward meeting the states renewable electricity standard
7992957 the study found that 600 mw of dispersed community based wind projects could be integrated across minnesota into the existing grid system with no additional costs for transmission
7992958 this study points clearly towards a major shift in electric utility management
7992959 the old way of doing business was to hook up a few very large central station power plants mostly coal and nuclear to high voltage powerlines to serve energy consumers in distant cities the new way as this study documents is to serve those same energy consumers by strategically locating smaller locally owned dispersed renewable energy facilities
7992960 this dispersed generation siting strategy has the potential to allow numerous new renewable generation projects to interconnect to the grid and not be constrained by transmission bottlenecks such as those now existing on buffalo ridge
7992961 no longer can old conventional central station electric utility thinking claim to provide the cheapest most reliable electric utility services in the new paradigm
7992962 utility services will be delivered increasingly by cleaner cheaper more reliable more secure and more equitable renewable energy projects owned by ordinary people in communities around the state with the energy delivered through smart grids rather than dumb powerlines

7993029 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7993030 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7993031 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7993032 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7993033 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7993034 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7993035 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7993036 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7993037 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7993038 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7993039 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7993040 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7993041 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7993042 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7993043 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7993044 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7993045 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7993046 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7993047 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7993048 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7993049 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7993050 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7993051 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7993052 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7993053 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons

7993078 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
7993079 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions

7993090 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7993091 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7993092 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration

7993105 life begins at conception is a core issue of faith
7993106 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7993107 this is a planning took where all things are going
7993108 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7993109 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7993110 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7993111 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7993112 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7993113 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7993114 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7993115 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7993116 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7993117 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community

7993119 is a big incentive to buy now versus later when you most likely wont have that option for you
7993120 it makes a lot of sense for builders to do a lot of promotions on that
7993121 were trying to let everyone know hey this is going away
7993122 if you can come up with some way to monetize it ahead of time it could help to offset the loss of that down payment assistance
7993123 you can offer lower rates you can offer further incentives
7993124 but if a homebuyer is going to have trouble coming up with a down payment thats difficult to offset
7993125 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7993126 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store

7993129 when youre there i sleep lengthwise and when youre gone i sleep diagonal in my bed
7993130 the thing i hate most about advertising is that it attracts all the bright creative and ambitious young people leaving us mainly with the slow and self obsessed to become our artists modern art is a disaster area never in the field of human history has so much been used to say so little
7993131 people who exist at the margins of society are very much like alice in wonderland
7993132 knowledge of the world is derived by observation experimentation and rational analysis

7993135 sport hat etwas emotionales positive emotionen werden auf marken transportiert die gewinnen damit an glaubw rdigkeit und die wahrscheinlichkeit dass sie sich verkaufen w chst
7993136 fu ball ist die absolute topsportart aber auch handball ist im kommen wegen der gewonnenen wm und auch das interesse am motorsport ist in deutschland traditionell gro
7993137 ob ein sport sich gut vermarkten l sst oder nicht h ngt stark von deutschen heros ab
7993138 das sieht man deutlich beim tennis und beim skispringen als graf und becker viele turniere gewonnen haben war das interesse am tennis in deutschland gro ebenso beim skispringen mit hannawald oder schmidt
7993139 die sportliche dramaturgie muss stimmen etwa wie beim biathlon wo eine mischung aus leistung und schussgl ck ber erfolg entscheidet und dann ist au erdem noch die sportliche historie wichtig eine sportart muss einen kulturkreis eben faszinieren so wie cricket in den commonwealth l ndern begeisterte anh nger hat dar berhinaus aber quasi bedeutungslos ist
7993140 trotz doping es gibt keine andere sportart neben dem motorsport wo das auto des sponsors so lange im bild zu sehen ist hat ein skoda mann einmal zu mir gesagt
7993141 volkswirtschaftlich gesehen kann sport als ein nebenaspekt gewertet werden dies ist eine frage der definition von sport beispielweise waren die monet ren einfl sse der fu ball wm 2006 im verh ltnis zur gesamten volkswirtschaft deutschlands verschwindend gering
7993142 i really got into the environment my senior year of high school and now everything i do is connected to the environment in some way

7993145 when i was 11 or 12 i remember once reading a book called something like 50 things you can do for the planet or something and i remember trying to do each and every one of them
7993146 recycling and making my own paper for instance which didnt work too well you couldnt write on it it was a clump of mushy paper but the thought was there
7993147 you see things change over time and you want to make things better for the future for society
7993148 im seeing more people going green driving more slowly to save gas for instance
7993149 i met her when she was still jasmin dayrit right after i founded bawt bay area wilderness training at an environmental educational event in marin
7993150 she was a member of a youth panel and when i called for people to help in my work she stepped up and became involved
7993151 she became a founding board member and that was 10 years ago
7993152 its not a stretch to say she was a pivotal person in an organization that has so far served 6 000 youth
7993153 with her youthful energy and intelligence shes really helped solve problems and get people involved
7993154 i work with projects that come straight from city council and not everyone gets to do that
7993155 in five years i still see myself working for the city and i hope to have a bigger presence in the city of vallejo in environmental things
7993156 allein dass wir ein gesetz f r den schutz der tiere brauchen ist eine schande

7993164 did you know your profile pic is being used on com
7993165 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7993166 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7993167 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7993168 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7993169 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7993170 more banks will come on the troubled list as credit problems worsen
7993171 everything about this looks like a strong storm that would evacuate platforms
7993172 we think energy prices are absolutely tied to the value of the dollar
7993173 an initial surge up in price but it may affect demand as well
7993174 a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes
7993175 siamo sempre impegnati in qualcosa che faccia trascorrere il tempo
7993176 it seems like non melanoma skin cancer even though it is a non fatal disease may be a warning sign for increased risk of other more serious cancers
7993177 it is far and away the most common form of cancer
7993178 mit 13 musste ich in die sportschule umziehen da sind wir um 6 uhr morgens aufgestanden danach war sofort eineinhalb stunden training oft haben wir dreimal am tag bis zu acht stunden trainiert
7993179 die eltern durften wir nur einmal pro woche am sonntag gesehen das war schon sehr hart
7993180 wir haben vor wichtigen turnieren h ufig tabletten bekommen vitamine sagte man uns
7993181 meine eltern haben ihm einfach nicht genug gezahlt oder ihm nicht genug geschenke gemacht
7993182 am anfang waren alle meine freunde und meine familie dagegen ich hatte auch zuerst angst weil ich nicht wusste wie es ist in deutschland inzwischen f hle ich mich aber sehr wohl habe viele freunde
7993183 bei olympia sind die chancen besser als bei der wm weil nicht so viele der top spielerinnen aus asien starten d rfen au erdem k mpfen die chinesinnen auch gegen den hohen erwartungsdruck
7993184 ein paar wochen in china als touristin zu sein das ist ok aber l nger dort zu sein da w rde ich mich nicht mehr wohl f hlen
7993185 mooi liedje was dat jaren 80 dacht ik circus custers ik ben het even kwijt

7993194 makes wind a very different kind of energy than it is today
7993195 im sure the reason that ive felt as good as i have even during treatment over the years is because of my nutrition
7993196 i still had my energy and i really think that with the different diet and supplements it enabled me to get through all my treatments still jogging every day and doing everything i always did
7993197 every organ system in your body has detoxifying enzymes these are enzymes that break down everything from second hand cigarette smoke to car exhaust fumes to pesticide and herbicide residues left on food and in our water and you need the proper nutrition to up regulate those enzymes
7993198 green tea has been associated with a lower risk of breast cancer and an improved prognosis in breast cancer in women that already have breast cancer green tea is loaded with compounds called phenols and polyphenols
7993199 it just becomes your way of new living and you dont even think that youre changing anything because it becomes your lifestyle
7993200 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7993201 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7993202 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7993203 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7993204 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

7993228 social media isnt a conversation between a person and a typical publisher its a conversation between a person and another person who also has a parallel life as a publisher there is no question that as we move closer to this model that all media becomes earned media
7993229 what we are saying is that one hundred percent of the publishers share should go to the people and then that gets divided up how they want the ad network side is what really deals with the brands and helping them get into social media
7993230 when you start asking people to share your brand all of a sudden your beginning to realize your source of media that is spreading your message is also your consumer which means you can ask them questions look at the results of what you are doing advertising becomes inherently measurable

7993245 thats what theyre going to step into thats the advantage of it our economy everything in the nation and the world is very diverse so its just training

7993257 medienwirksame plakatkampagnen gegen rassismus bringen den funktion ren ein ruhiges gewissen haben aber nichts mit der realit t in den d rfern zu tun dieses geld sollte besser in beratungsstrukturen investiert werden

7993275 we strongly condemn the dastardly attack and violent killing of swami lakshmanananda saraswati and his associates
7993276 we feel totally abandoned this morning the authorities sent three policemen to watch over the nuns convent and the bishops residence but they dont even have a stick to protect us from the fury of the mob
7993277 we christians refuse violence we condemn every act of violence and terrorism but we are also against taking the law into our own hands
7993278 as soon as we heard about swami lakshmanananda saraswatis assassination i issued a public statement strongly condemning the dastardly attack and murders i called on everyone to remain peaceful and in harmony we want relations of friendship with all communities

7993286 my seniors ride free program has been a success from its beginning in january
7993287 now thanks to this new law all disabled individuals eligible for circuit breaker in illinois can also enjoy the benefits and freedoms that public transit provides i am very pleased to sign this bill into law today
7993288 this new law will make the daily lives of individuals with disabilities easier by limiting the burden of transportation costs i am proud to have co sponsored this bill and look forward to seeing it take effect
7993289 i have been looking forward to this ever since i heard the governor announce the seniors ride free program this winter
7993290 he promised he would work to extend the benefit to people with disabilities and i am excited that he lived up to his promise i look forward to riding the buses and trains to doctors appointments the grocery store or wherever i need to go without having to cut into my budget
7993291 persons with disabilities are often transit dependent so it is important that we improve access to transit for those who need it most to live independently
7993292 i am pleased to see governor blagojevich sign this legislation
7993293 by providing these free rides on fixed route service we are giving additional mobility to those who need it most and helping them to improve their quality of life
7993294 we are pleased that this new free ride benefit will be available to people with disabilities on a limited income
7993295 public transportation is critical to the everyday lives of many people with disabilities this free ride benefit will offer more independence to get to work school medical and social appointments etc and thus will benefit us all
7993296 the enactment of a free ride program for people with disabilities will help them to be more active and achieve the goals and daily necessities of importance to the entire community

7993352 sport wurde seit der gr ndung der volksrepublik benutzt um politische signale zu setzen nach innen wie nach au en mit dem zuschlag f r die spiele wurden f nf jahres pl ne aufgestellt und die mit olympia verbundenen ziele konsequent verfolgt dazu geh rt nat rlich auch der sportliche erfolg
7993353 diese totalitarisierung des hochleistungssports die athleten voll in anspruch nimmt die gibt es ebenso auch bei uns wenn man die erfolgreichen sportler der welt betrachtet dann sind die trainingsmethoden weitestgehend identisch das chinesische system unterscheidet sich da kaum von dem in der usa oder in deutschland
7993354 ein totalit res system wird immer unter diesem verdacht leben wer ein autorit res regime verantwortet der muss mit dem vorwurf rechnen dass auch dinge manipuliert werden
7993355 die olympischen spiele hatten von vornherein das ziel chinas f hrung auch moralisch zu st rken die sportler werden dabei automatisch zu einem teil des unterdr ckungsapparats ihre goldmedaillen sind nur eine weitere zutat in dem gehirnw sche cocktail der dem chinesischen volk verabreicht wird

7993370 once the team management and the swimmers and nzoc get back in the country well meet with them and review everything and decide at that stage whether any further action is necessary
7993371 im just really keen to make sure something silly like this doesnt overshadow the incredible performances that they had
7993372 whether its a cycling team or a swimming team its made pretty clear to them what the code of conduct is and clearly something like this probably breaches that
7993373 for something like this to put a dampener on it is a real shame
7993374 inappropriate and foolhardy behaviour at the end of a long campaign
7993375 its something that both swimming new zealand and the nzoc will have to address its not something that can be ignored
7993376 any time protocol isnt followed it has to be addressed
7993377 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
7993378 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
7993379 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them

7993381 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
7993382 i got stymied behind the tree and i got lucky because i got a drop because of some gopher holes or whatever it was
7993383 it wasnt where my ball was but like about 5 or 6 feet left it was actually moving you could see the grass going up and down it was actually there and we were trying to find it but we couldnt
7993384 i just wanted to know why he got a drop there was obviously a mole there and he was burrowing at that moment you could see him popping out i was really focused on what i was doing
7993385 westchester was a good golf course this tops westchester every single player out there absolutely enjoyed this golf course

7993387 its hard to see your friend not win especially if hes playing against you but somebody has to win
7993388 i really am happy with how i played and obviously disappointed i wasnt able to play a little bit better in the playoff
7993389 ive got to forget about that and think about the other 72 holes
7993390 it was a tough day it wasnt easy to get close to the hole so birdie was difficult to come by
7993391 it was drying out really really a lot and youve got to play almost conservative on some holes
7993392 but it was a great playoff though i enjoyed that
7993393 i was a good round and it gives me some momentum to carry over
7993394 i have spent days and nights thinking about why i said what i did in front of the sec on may 25 2007
7993395 my statement before the sec was completely out of character for me i have tried to live my life in a way that showed that hard work and honesty were their own reward
7993396 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7993397 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7993398 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7993399 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

7993422 for decades the issue of climate change has focused on a debate about the science
7993423 we have learned that outspoken scientists have had their sound conclusions revised or interfered with by those motivated by politics not the truth
7993424 we must fully investigate this politically motivated conduct to be certain that the american people get the benefit from what science can teach us
7993425 this is a critically important issue to vermont and vermonters from vermont to california states have realized they can and they must make a contribution toward a more sustainable future meaningful federal policy must follow
7993426 the test of leadership is to directly face difficult realities we must have honest science available to guide us
7993427 nothing travels faster than the speed of light with the possible exception of bad news which obeys its own special laws
7993428 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7993429 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7993430 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7993431 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7993432 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7993433 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7993434 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7993435 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7993436 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7993437 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7993438 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7993439 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7993440 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7993441 its really hard to get people to spend money on music but going to sites like imeem is a good way to learn about the band before you buy the tickets
7993442 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7993443 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7993444 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7993445 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7993446 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7993447 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7993448 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7993449 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7993450 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7993451 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7993452 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7993453 who are open to doing something on the production side
7993454 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7993455 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7993456 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7993457 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7993458 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7993459 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7993460 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7993461 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7993462 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7993463 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7993464 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7993465 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7993466 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7993467 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7993468 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7993469 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7993470 i think we deserved to win the gold medal because we did an incredible job if it hadnt been for the officials wed have the gold instead of the silver
7993471 if they had blown the whistle for the steps they take the defense with the hands they use and had blown the whistle on everything its clear that we would have won we got to within three points in spite of the referees and if theyd been good we would have won pretty clearly
7993472 if the referees had followed fiba rules we would have won but we are very satisfied with the silver
7993473 well all vote for hillary there will be a catharsis and then well all unite behind barack obama
7993474 in every election theres a winner and barack obama is the winner so im now a hillary supporter for barack obama
7993475 the second place candidates name is always placed in nomination but once the winning candidate reaches the number of delegates he needs to clinch they quit voting and call for a nomination by acclamation
7993476 do you really think the american people know john mccain
7993477 his voting record is going to come back to haunt him i want more scrutiny of john mccain its going to start happening and people are going to wake up to who the real john mccain is
7993478 dont think this election is going to be a walk in the park
7993479 tavi only you could manage to find this much crap

7993486 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

7993511 on the forenoon of the fourth of november inauspiciously our present year election day last
7993512 supposing however that something like moderation were visible in this political sermon yet politics and the pulpit are terms that have little agreement no sound ought to be heard in the church but the healing voice of christian charity the cause of civil liberty and civil government gains as little as that of religion by this confusion of duties those who quit their proper character to assume what does not belong to them are for the greater part ignorant both of the character they leave and of the character they assume wholly unacquainted with the world in which they are so fond of meddling and inexperienced in all its affairs on which they pronounce with so much confidence they have nothing of politics but the passions they excite surely the church is a place where one days truce ought to be allowed to the dissensions and animosities of mankind
7993513 this pulpit style revived after so long a discontinuance had to me the air of novelty and of a novelty not wholly without danger
7993514 it is somewhat remarkable that this reverend divine should be so earnest for setting up new churches and so perfectly indifferent concerning the doctrine which may be taught in them
7993515 but i may say of our preacher his doctrines affect our constitution in its vital parts
7993516 beim letzten marathon in budapest bin ich 3 18 stunden gelaufen damit gewinne ich nat rlich keinen blumentopf aber darum geht es f r mich auch nicht

7993519 pal stina ist zum beispiel mit einem eigenen team bei olympia angetreten wir w ren auch unter neutraler olympischer flagge eingelaufen wie das einige nationen w hrend der balkan krise gemacht haben aber auch das hat das ioc ausgeschlossen
7993520 es w re eine schallende ohrfeige gewesen wenn wir als team tibet in peking h tten starten d rfen
7993521 es ist absolut legitim wirtschaftliche interessen zu verfolgen dann sollte man aber nicht versuchen das anders zu verkaufen und auf die olympische wenig kontakt in die heimat
7993522 zuhause bei meinen eltern ist alles sehr tibetisch wir reden tibetisch darauf legt meine familie auch gro en wert mit deutschen rede ich anders als mit tibetern
7993523 am anfang war noch etwas ber sms m glich aber seit den unruhen im m rz geht gar nichts mehr

7993536 es el partido de mayor transcendencia desde que estoy aqu
7993537 sin lugar a dudas es el partido m s importante desde que estoy aqu hace dos a os lleg en el verano de 2006 para m y para los jugadores es el de mayor transcendencia hablaba con cerezo y dec amos lo mismo es el m s importante desde que es presidente
7993538 el ambiente que rodea al equipo la prensa las preguntas la afici n por la calle la familia misma est distinta aqu tengo gente que ha jugado champions mundiales uefa partidos internacionales muchos de ellos han jugado partidos como ste
7993539 si somos capaces de canalizar estas ganas de que empiece ya el partido esa energ a la canalizamos al terreno de juego la trasladamos all somos intensos y muy solidarios como equipo tenemos posibilidades
7993540 es importante cumplir un objetivo por el que fui contratado
7993541 el partido tiene una dificultad vamos perdiendo 1 0 hasta que no seamos capaces de igualar la contienda hasta ese momento es donde nos hemos preparado hemos estado trabajando m s en la tranquilidad que hay que tener en 90 minutos nos hace falta un gol para que empiece la eliminatoria nos hemos preparado para tratar de igualar la eliminatoria que hoy est desnivelada
7993542 habl con la plantilla y les dec a a los jugadores que la obligaci n era entregarse en el terreno de juego correr luchar y pelear por esta camiseta esa es la obligaci n y la transmiti el presidente pero no habl de resultados
7993543 todos los que estamos en el atl tico sabemos que es un jugador importante pero hasta l lo ha dicho un equipo lo formamos todos los 24 jugadores de la plantilla y kun es uno de ellos tiene unas caracter sticas especiales y distintas pero est claro que la labor del conjunto est por encima
7993544 pienso que la plantilla est consciente como yo de que es un jugador m s al que no le podemos meter m s presi n entiendo que la prensa y la gente est vida de ponerlo como el m ximo salvador kun y la plantilla son inteligentes y saben cada uno su parcela y qu trabajo tienen que hacer
7993545 va a estar muy motivado no es lo mismo venir con la medalla de oro que ser eliminado y venir vac o para el equipo nos da alegr a por l pero no es significativo tenemos que jugar con y sin el kun y jugar bien
7993546 es un hombre que le motiva mucho es su yerno pienso que motiva mucho a los argentinos y a los futbolistas todos los que vimos jugar a diego nos hace mucha ilusi n que est empujando al equipo desde el palco que sea un hincha m s
7993547 es un sue o hecho realidad y la espera durante estos d as no se ha hecho larga ya que sab a que todo ir a bien se ha fijado un buen precio y todo ha salido perfecto
7993548 despu s del partido ante el villarreal roberto olabe director deportivo del club me dijo que ten a inter s en que firmara y que estuviera tranquilo que un par de d as se har an las gestiones para que estuviera aqu
7993549 f tbol es f tbol y da igual la lengua lo que el entrenador quiere que haga lo acabar haciendo
7993550 me encanta jugar al f tbol y para jugar en primera divisi n necesito ser fuerte y endurecer mi juego voy a entrenar para lograrlo y espero que mendilibar cambie de opini n
7993551 jugar bien ayudar al equipo y devolver la confianza depositada
7993552 el equipo mejore la posici n del a o pasado y finalice el campeonato alrededor de la d cima plaza
7993553 c modo tanto en el puesto de medio centro como en la media punta por detr s de los delanteros
7993554 es el jefe por mendilibar el que tiene la ltima palabra
7993555 una situaci n de mercado que se nos ha presentado con un jugador potencial con una edad extraordinaria diferente que tiene cosas que mejorar pero que es un activo importante del club
7993556 estamos trabajando con este jugador a corto medio y largo plazo
7993557 un muy buen pasador que tiene muy buen toque una muy buena panor mica de juego pero que le falta intensidad dentro del modelo de juego de aqu ya que en holanda se ensancha mucho el campo y en espa a todo se acorta

7993562 sorry wim yes i am italian can you tell me when you will join us thank you for being so not italian
7993563 veo que el equipo me gusta como est formado hay gente con experiencia que el pasado a o lo pas mal pero eso fortalece un grupo yo tambi n puedo aportar mi piedra a este proyecto para construir algo muy serio e importante
7993564 creo que esta oportunidad es un pasito adelante respecto a mis temporadas en granada el hecho de jugar la eurocup es muy importante porque para un equipo sirve para afrontar y mejorar en las dos competiciones y tener como meta llegar a los m s alto posible
7993565 mi personalidad me ha hecho ganar la estima de los compa eros pero eso se hace con el trabajo aqu tenemos varios jugadores con experiencia y caracter sticas humanas para funcionar muy bien juntos yo me implico mucho en mi trabajo y en la pista me gusta que la gente me recuerde al cien por cien siempre
7993566 muy importante para poder demostrar algo en la liga acb
7993567 aprecio la oportunidad de venir aqu a jugar es muy importante para poder demostrar algo en la liga acb vamos a jugar la eurocup y creo que tenemos grandes oportunidades de hacerlo bien y poder alcanzar grandes cosas
7993568 he conocido cuatro o cinco jugadores del equipo y por lo visto creo que tenemos muchas opciones de hacer cosas importantes con este grupo
7993569 espero que nos podamos mantener fuera de lesiones todo el a o para poder hacerlo lo mejor posible y tener una temporada afortunada
7993570 en principio no tenemos licencias y podemos decir que est cerrada aunque en el deporte moderno eso no se puede decir por las lesiones pero podemos decir que el trabajo de verano se da por finalizado
7993571 frank in his opening remarks noted that no democrat who voted against the federal marriage amendment was defeated however several who voted for it and ran for re election were defeated
7993572 i shall be granted a visa now and as soon as it is ready ill go to england for the signing of the contract
7993573 i have already returned to moscow so i will not play in kiev
7993574 everything happened very quickly i did not even have time to say goodbye to my spartak team mates
7993575 when i learn something new and it happens every day i feel a little more at home in this universe a little more comfortable in the nest
7993576 in racial division they are not interested they are sort of bored with it
7993577 the most open discussion of race since the civil rights movement in many ways that is a wonderful moment
7993578 are sometimes reluctant to see what they worked for come to fruition which is a nonracist society because they really want that to happen but it is very difficult to give up on
7993579 it opens your eyes to the concept that black talent is much wider and much more expansive than you thought it was
7993580 everything has changed now and it has become much more complex at that time i touched a very raw nerve as the memory of the 60s was much closer
7993581 it is like othello everybody focuses on the fact that othello is black it is the least important thing about him
7993582 who wants to talk about issues when you can talk about oh hes black
7993583 it would do a great deal for americas image of itself and i dont mean young black boys and girls who can say with a loud resounding voice i can i can
7993584 every person can say this truly is a place that if you work hard enough and if you have the right skill set then you can do anything you want to do that is what america always stood for
7993585 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
7993586 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
7993587 what obama has to have hillary do is stand up and say not only in words but its got to be almost method acting and say it in a way thats believable that she wants barack obama to be president
7993588 frankly goes toward any future political considerations she may have
7993589 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7993590 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7993591 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7993592 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7993593 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7993594 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7993595 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7993596 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7993597 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7993598 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7993599 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7993600 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7993601 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7993602 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7993603 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7993604 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7993605 no one works for someone we all just work together
7993606 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7993607 biskopen i dovers stift stephen venner b rjade gr ta n r han sade att han sk mdes ver sin kyrka som ignorerar dem som mots tter sig beslutet
7993608 det som ber r och uppr r mig n r jag l ser om biskop stephen venners t rar r det uppenbara de handlar om k rlek till kyrkan och den tradition som hon st r i inte att strukturellt f rnedra eller nedtrycka kvinnor om det inte handlade om det skulle v l inte en biskop st lla sig och gr ta p en generalsynod om man inte menar att det var grinollet rar en liten pojkes of rm ga att hantera att andra inte tycker och beslutar som han g r och vill det skulle vara f rnedrande att g ra en s dan tolkning
7993609 actually the asking price is x 15 but i can get you in at x and the maintenance is actually y 25 mo but that might be negotiable
7993610 broker on the place was booked at that time anyway
7993611 i set out to have wine and cheese at punch and judys and though their recorded message said they were open daily at 5 00 they were not
7993612 well they want to know if they can join you
7993613 but actually now that i think about it they should have offered to buy you drinks right i know that is so tacky so maybe no maybe ill tell them that youre out because one of you is engaged who wants to be the engaged one how about you put the right on the other hand like they wouldnt even know and ill just tell them you are celebrating right it will be so funny
7993614 yeah like that works too el oh el oh by the way theres a 25 credit card minimum
7993615 my superiors were not happy the local bishop was not happy but they did not understand me either
7993616 it was not at all my intention to put nuns on the catwalk
7993617 give us a passion to advance opportunities for the least of these for widows and orphans for single moms and children whose fathers have left
7993618 help us figure out how to pay teachers what they deserve and give children an equal opportunity to get a college education
7993619 that would be the most amazing thing that could happen
7993620 i dont watch him unless im already out of the tournament
7993621 i know hes not an evil man theres not evil in his heart
7993622 i know that i love him i know that much
7993623 i saw michael talk and sing and hes so very charismatic
7993624 i decided to donate the money because i thought it could benefit more people but what a con
7993625 we are experiencing internal network issues thereby leading to an unplanned downtime of the service

7993631 when we look at what whiteness has done to the minds of men in this country we can see clearly what the new testament meant when it spoke of the principalities and powers
7993632 together black religion and marxist philosophy may show us the way to build a completely new society
7993633 is really the one who took it his philosophy from my books and brought it to the church
7993634 to be black is to be committed to destroying everything this country loves and adores
7993635 places the marxist emphasis on action and change in the christian context and is compatible with black theologys concerns
7993636 i dont see anything in obamas books or in the philadelphia race speech that contradicts black liberation theology
7993637 take from the haves and give to the have nots
7993638 the christian faith does not possess in its nature the means for analyzing the structure of capitalism marxism as a tool of social analysis can disclose the gap between appearance and reality and thereby help christians to see how things really are

7993675 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops

7993680 tem hist ria precisamos ter um centro de treinamento em s o carlos
7993681 we intervene in the hardware stream and say how about a virtual network and that is starting to ramp up
7993682 we started to buy commercial suites like xensource now owned by citrix or vmware but we always hated their licensing programs and the way they tried to limit growth so we wound up back at xen org
7993683 we pitch the idea that were pragmatic rather than the latest and greatest we know how to operate a cloud really effectively by using tried and true tools and one of them is xen we showcase that were involved in the project and they would much rather have their applications in a stable environment than a supercharged always failing environment
7993684 we were into coldfusion and j j allaire adopted linux early weve developed on top of linux ever since
7993685 i find myself always gravitating to the gnu type projects they are the best way to develop venture backed applications with the amount of creativity coming out of the community and the value right out of the box you realize a real benefit by always using foss
7993686 the other day i was looking around the office and realized we use a lot of linux applications
7993687 we didnt set out to build the company on linux but we wound up doing that because everything just fits we use
7993688 we still have to use exchange but were about to move over to an exchange knockoff with a great feature set called kerio
7993689 i was like any business owner but we have to buy so many support contracts for clients servers hardware and you start to realize theyre not really interested in supporting you it used to be dell had this four hour support contract and it was easy to get them to do the work as time has gone on they have changed that we went to dell the other day and they wanted us to troubleshoot you have to go through all the troubleshooting before they will dispatch a part the more i see that the more i say i would rather rely on the community discussion boards its all right there and i can just get it rather than having to social engineer my way through tier one support
7993690 but we do get to see the net effect of all the software as it is running on diverse systems and we contribute back support we keep an active wiki and dump chunks of it back into the community to help the discussion sugar rolled out a revision recently and we saw the broken parts within minutes we let people know and many people avoided upgrading to that release were not stellar code contributors but we do play a role
7993691 the principal flexibility of open source is unlocked by being able to leverage many php or java developers to produce your vision
7993692 with a network company the advantage of open source is even clearer if you have a programmer you can string together an entire systems desk by using open source connectors that work together and that looks like a large network management company the advantage is i get the same efficiency as a enterprise grade product at much lower expense
7993693 hear this tragic tale a sleeping family a talented murderer and an adventurous toddler orphaned but not assassinated small and alone by accident and luck he escapes the scene of the crime and climbs a grassy hill to safety at the top of the hill the boy finds a fence and on the other side a dark quiet place and what is to become of him
7993694 hell be happy for me cos he has always wanted me to be out of my shell more and give myself the gratitude and confidence i deserve
7993695 we especially want to encourage young men to audition because we are in need of male members for the troupe

7993699 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7993700 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7993701 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7993702 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
7993703 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
7993704 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
7993705 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
7993706 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
7993707 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
7993708 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
7993709 i didnt know the faa sent all of their communications through the twitter server
7993710 a truly wise person knows how much they dont know
7993711 the stronger the family the stronger the army because strong families improve combat readiness
7993712 it has words in it that resound today in terms of resilience in strength
7993713 this is not welfare not gimmes but things that army families depend on to be able to persevere through this persistent conflict
7993714 most of programs are funded by our global war on terrorism supplemental dollars
7993715 they will be sustainable because weve taken about half of those dollars and put them into the base funding program in the long term we wont retain an all volunteer force unless we retain army families
7993716 only 3 percent of those returning have lost limbs and yet that is who the people think of when they think of severely wounded veterans the rest of them have multiple injuries
7993717 most of them have post traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injury and these are the ones who may decide to get out of the military
7993718 so we wrap our arms around them and their families to provide some of them counseling and to help them get job skills
7993719 we have a university that will broadcast classes into their room at walter reed at no charge so they can go ahead and get their bachelors their masters they will get life skill credits in the college and we do everything to get them employable and help to find them jobs
7993720 were finally getting after our geographically dispersed soldiers before we really couldnt conceive of how to use the technology to get to our reserve national guard engineer district rotc recruiting battalion soldiers and families
7993721 were doing that with military one source and what we call the army integrated family support network which will be unveiled in october
7993722 so were doing things like getting counselors in the schools to help the military child with transition
7993723 the hardest thing in the world the first day of school is who are you going to sit with at lunch they made sure that they would assign a buddy to go with them just knowing things like this as a mother was a huge thing for me that made a tremendous difference in the ease of moves for my children and thus for my husband and me
7993724 its the army taking responsibility not for just its on post schools but for where 70 percent of its families live and thats off post
7993725 a soldier will write a check payee freedom and put down an arm or a leg or his life but he will not risk his children ever
7993726 otherwise were all going to win these elections hold these offices go around with our titles for the rest of our lives
7993727 but the reason we do all this is so we can change the lives of ordinary people and save the planet for our children and grandchildren
7993728 that will only happen if we dramatically and i do mean dramatically increase the capacity of democracy to deliver
7993729 for giving me one more excuse to show up at my partys convention
7993730 the whole idea was wed all go around telling everybody that this democracy is messy and the worst of all systems in churchills words except for all the others
7993731 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think he can deliver on anything you believe candidate y can deliver for whom will you vote
7993732 americas going to get back on track on climate change we will partner with the rest of the world after this election

7993743 cheese afterall you are allowed to be a tourist ever once and again
7993744 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7993745 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening
7993746 to help restrain inflation and inflation expectations which were at risk of drifting higher
7993747 saw a greater risk to the economy from upward pressures on inflation
7993748 generally expected to be weak during the remainder of 2008 before recovering modestly next year
7993749 seen as potentially exacerbating the contraction in the housing sector
7993750 cancelling these subsidies might reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 6 percent a year while contributing 0 1 percent to global gdp
7993751 governments should urgently review their energy subsidies and begin phasing out the harmful ones
7993752 many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy
7993753 some countries spend more on subsidies than on health and education combined they stand in the way of more environmentally friendly technologies
7993754 objects of historic and scientific interest that may be appropriate for recognition protection or improved conservation and management
7993755 when evaluating the information to be included please remember we are looking to identify significant historic or scientific qualities that make these areas special unique and worthy of additional protection or recognition
7993756 to put it in more simplistic terms we are looking to identify the wow factor for each of these sites
7993757 we rely on fishing as a source of food and jobs
7993758 those who live in the cnmi have no interest in ceding their cultural heritage to the federal government under the auspices of environmental protectionism
7993759 this is an opportunity for president bush to do something really good that will be looked at as a high point of his administration if he does it right
7993760 by right i mean he gives big broad protections and full protections around these islands and atolls not postage stamp protections
7993761 this is planetary destabilization and its already begun the question is how do we arrest this before it gets to the point of catastrophe
7993762 the earth could be free of arctic summer ice within our lifetime
7993763 this has not happened as far as we know in 130 000 years as long as human beings have existed on the planet
7993764 if you had a gauge in your car reading in the red zone how long would you feel comfortable driving down the highway like that thats where we are now
7993765 he said you dont understand were going to ban the sale of new automobiles in this country
7993766 if we were to move to the most efficient lighting technologies available today we could reduce electricity demand by 12 percent
7993767 in the new energy economy we see 40 percent of the worlds electricity coming from wind
7993768 that would require building roughly a million and a half wind turbines over the next dozen years now a million and a half may sound like a lot but we make 65 million cars a year
7993769 i mention that just to give a sense of how much renewable energy there is out there three states in the u s kansas north dakota and texas have enough energy capacity to power the whole country
7993770 from being a nation of energy consumers to being a nation of energy producers
7993771 wouldnt it be nice if you put solar panels on your house you got a check in the mail farmers in germany now have a new revenue stream
7993772 we have the solutions we just need to come up with the political will to get those technologies out there even faster
7993773 we believe in using nonviolent civil disobedience at times when its necessary to incite change it takes me to jail sometimes
7993774 as i look around the room i see some of the people ive been to jail with here today
7993775 we cant have half measures we dont have time to lose we have to hit the ground running
7993776 now is the time to speak the truth and bring new people into the political process
7993777 are we going to have the biggest political failure in the history of the world
7993778 verily who is this child that he opens our hearts and minds to the audacity of hope
7993779 are particularly useful in a sentence that is long and complex
7993780 bmi in common with most other airlines is planning to reduce capacity generally in its network over the winter period in the light of expected weaker demand and high fuel prices
7993781 seasonal adjustments to flight schedules and the aircraft that operate them are not uncommon
7993782 there is always a risk for jersey as a short haul destination and short haul destinations tend to be more expensive for airlines to operate than the longer haul
7993783 consequently with aviation fuel almost doubling in price over the last 12 months and a potential recession in the uk which might lead to people deciding not to travel as much theres a risk to a number of routes
7993784 for this year what i think is entertaining is some of the people who will be performing
7993785 its a response and a message to stop violence against women and girls and to empower them to live life to the fullest and to really do what they dream to do it means different things to different people
7993786 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
7993787 it could be any location because one facility is now processing flight data for everybody
7993788 there are cancelations due to weather from the hurricane but not due to this
7993789 were not going to let an unsafe condition exist its just going to be slower

7993793 weve gradually increased activities in the summer as a way for professional development and to have large groups of teachers do collaborative work and build continuity from one year to the next
7993794 we all have blind spots and a colleague can see those for you
7993795 sometimes the trickier a student is to work with the more colleagues you need to help you see your own blind spots
7993796 one of the fundamental beliefs i have is if you get people together to agree what the most important things are and you have a common commitment to work together to see that students learn those things then i think the outside assessments take care of themselves
7993797 internet ist eh alles quatsch sozis kann man immer mal bashen

7993800 the card was lying in the bottom of a postal bin
7993801 where is our federal government when our states need it
7993802 youd better not be holding that phone up to your head
7993803 a regular wired headset allows the radiation from your cell phone to travel up the wire to your head additionally it can act as its own antenna grabbing up radiation from the environment and directing it at your head
7993804 however if a wired headset is not well shielded and most of them are not the wire itself acts as an antenna which can increase radiation up to 300 and attracting ambient information carrying radio waves and transmitting radiation directly to your brain
7993805 we have to maximize our ability to come away with some kind of acceptable outcome
7993806 com muita dor e tristeza que fa o essa declara o hoje por 16 anos eu tenho lutado contra a pornografia e como resultado dessa vida secreta de pecado meu corpo acaba sofrendo eu relato a causa dos meus sintomas simplesmente como doen as e tenho dedicado muitos anos da minha vida ao minist rio tentando compensar os meus pecados eu acredito que eu amo jesus e que sei que ele me ama e que seu amor juntamente com as ora es de pessoas ao redor do mundo me trouxeram ao lugar de confiss o

7993808 por favor continuem orando por minha esposa por mim e por minha fam lia j que temos um longo e rduo caminho pela frente mas sou grato a deus pela estrada que finalmente estou caminhando
7993809 enquanto calei os meus pecados envelheceram os meus ossos pelos meus constantes gemidos todo o dia
7993810 spot us would give a new sense of editorial power to the public
7993811 lets imagine we have 7 million elements and 10 million attributes if on average each attribute and element is about 2 characters long then you have 34 megabytes of data to parse if instead though the average length of an attribute and element were more like 10 characters then youre talking about 170 megabytes
7993812 will reaffirm the economic bill of rights which franklin roosevelt wrote into our national conscience sixteen years ago
7993813 1 the right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation
7993814 2 the right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation
7993815 3 the right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living
7993816 4 the right of every businessman large and small to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home and abroad
7993817 5 the right of every family to a decent home
7993818 6 the right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health
7993819 7 the right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age sickness accidents and unemployment
7993820 hopefully what were talking about is something that will not happen
7993821 if it does we wouldnt just say come back next year what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
7993822 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
7993823 the obama campaign knows it cant argue the facts of the link between obama and ayers so it is instead resorting to a desperate campaign of intimidation and legal threats
7993824 the scary question this raises is if barack obama demonstrates this little regard for free speech from his opponents during the campaign what could the american people expect from him as a president
7993825 the tremendous amount of time money and effort the campaign is expending to run its own ads on the ayers controversy and dispatch its hired guns all over the country during the democratic convention speaks to the fear they must have that this issue is resonating with american voters
7993826 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
7993827 given that bats are far more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue
7993828 i really tried to emphasise here that this process up to copenhagen is a golden opporutnity for african countries to make sure that the next regime does meet their needs in a much better way
7993829 they need to formulate what is essential to them to act both to limit emissions and to adapt to the impacts of climate change
7993830 africa has to know whats to the liking of africa
7993831 africa is still not profiting from the instruments we have
7993832 countries have developed a better understanding here of how they want to deal with deforestation how they want to reward people for forest conservation
7993833 i think theres a strong sentiment in the room especially among developing countries that a decision to address a sector is something you decide at the national level
7993834 in the past 20 years temperature in indonesia rose 0 3 degree celsius that s why we need to anticipate possibilities in the future
7993835 farmers will no longer be able to make a prediction when they will grow rice so that they will suffer losses when the dry season comes earlier than harvest time the dry season which comes one month earlier than usual will lead to harvest failures
7993836 in fact the rice imports account for 20 percent of the total global rice trade
7993837 therefore efforts must constantly be made to ensure food availability through various ways
7993838 i want to be director of rugby in south africa
7993839 i dont want to be in the limelight and im not looking for the pressures that go with it ive had my turn
7993840 all id like to do is help thats what i have always wanted to do
7993841 there are too many forwards standing around in the backline
7993842 they try to do half of what we did and half of their own thing half of everything leaves you with nothing
7993843 no one in world rugby is playing the way their coach is talking about not successfully anyway
7993844 everyone has discipline policies and a procedure in their game the way he is talking is nonsense you cant just play an expansive wide game
7993845 this is still a very good squad of players most are even at their peak or approaching it so there is plenty of talent but what they need is the organisation and discipline
7993846 the hard thing for peter is that he has never coached professionally and this is one of the most difficult teams to coach
7993847 he has to change his philosophy because it doesnt suit these players
7993848 peters big test now is to learn if he learns he can turn it around but if he continues to be stubborn he wont last long because his tactics wont work
7993849 meg there are about a million reasons for you to stay at brads and that is the least of them
7993850 they took eight cellphones from me when i refused to give them the remaining two they began beating me with a wooden pole
7993851 i accelerated and stopped about 500m further down the road
7993852 when i stopped he rearranged how he was sitting on the bonnet and then i drove at about 40 or 50km h into town
7993853 being part of a bowling unit it does not really matter who takes the wickets we have also got the knowledge and experience of andrew flintoff and steve harmison and they are always passing it on
7993854 we are all bowling for each other and the fielding has been fantastic which only gives the bowlers confidence hopefully we can seal the series on friday
7993855 we are doing everything well at the moment we are turning up on time turning up on form and hammering the training sessions the recipe for success is hard work and the boys are doing the simple things better than the other team but i am not going to go overboard we have not won the series yet
7993856 we can only apologise for a very poor performance people were rightly angry that they did not get a proper game
7993857 it is difficult to put a finger on what went wrong we have a number of injuries but that is no excuse we were just not good enough on the field
7993858 we have got to pick ourselves up and make sure our next performance is a lot better

7993886 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals
7993887 it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived
7993888 technologically speaking there is no clear advantage of one tool over the other when we think of neanderthals we need to stop thinking in terms of stupid or less advanced and more in terms of different
7993889 colonising a continent isnt easy colonising a continent during the ice age is even harder
7993890 so for early homo sapiens colonising ice age europe a new shared and flashy looking technology might serve as one form of social glue by which larger social networks were bonded

7993893 the humour is not as in your face as it used to be
7993894 were trying to have something thats a little more rebellious in some ways but its sort of hard
7993895 were a lot more careful now about not offending people we live in a fairly sensitive society
7993896 we helped on the coordination with the family and the town
7993897 we felt the family has enough on their minds plus there are so many people who wanted to help and everyone was going in different directions

7993908 these accredited certifying agents acas have outstanding issues or proposed corrective actions that nop has determined warrant a subsequent audit before renewal can be granted
7993909 it is clear that there are numerous violations of organic standards taking place in the us and across the world
7993910 its strange to me that the usda has published information about audits that are still in process
7993911 for the certifiers identified as under a cloud of suspicion it could harm their business
7993912 its very rare that all the details required of the certifier which are many are in order
7993913 it is reassuring that the usda is doing a much more thorough job and being more professional
7993914 peer review would oversee the accreditation process and make sure that nop is following the rules
7993915 its time for the usda to stop dragging their heels and begin the public process to set up an organic community peer review panel so can we can start policing organic standards ourselves
7993916 they say things like i dont know anything about it and i dont want to poison my family
7993917 more than enough food is produced to feed a healthy global population distribution and access to food is a problem many are hungry while at the same time many overeat
7993918 we are providing food to take care of not only our necessary consumption but also our wasteful habits
7993919 curbing these losses and improving water productivity provides win win opportunities for farmers business ecosystems and the global hungry
7993920 an effective water saving strategy requires that minimizing food wastage is firmly placed on the political agenda
7993921 thats like leaving the tap running and pouring 40 trillion liters of water into the garbage can enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
7993922 saving water from field to fork curbing losses and wastage in the food chain
7993923 unless we change our practices water will be a key constraint to food production in the future
7993924 people toss the food they buy and all the resources used to grow ship and produce the food along with it
7993925 improving water productivity and reducing the quantity of food that is wasted can enable us to provide a better diet for the poor and enough food for growing populations
7993926 reaching the target we propose a 50 percent reduction of losses and wastage in the production and consumption chain is a necessary and achievable goal
7993927 saving water from field to fork curbing losses and wastage in the food chain
7993928 the improved understanding of trade and water management issues on local regional and global scales are of the highest relevance for the successful and sustainable use of water resources

7993939 separating commercial influences from doctor education might require doctors to pay their own way

7993951 oh we cant give you those records it would be a hippa violation
7993952 we cant discuss your mothers cancer on the phone without a signed release that would be a hipaa violation

7993991 while we should all enjoy the beautiful weather and it is late in the season we cannot let our guard down the best way to protect your family and yourself is to take simple prevention steps we urge everybody to use effective insect repellent and try to wear long sleeves and pants while outside at dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active with the heavy rains this summer it is especially important that people remove any water collecting on their property in artificial containers such as in flower pots or pool covers
7993992 we have continued our surveillance efforts this year for these diseases and will enhance local efforts as needed through state sponsored mosquito trapping
7993993 i am hopeful that this wnv eee season will be short and that we will have an early frost but people should continue to be vigilant with prevention measures such as wearing mosquito repellant until that time there are several effective mosquito repellents available and people are encouraged to choose the one that works best for them and use it consistently

7994014 why did tuesdays front page have a picture of dan rodricks and his column with only a gossipy article about the democratic convention while i enjoy dan rodrickss column it is not front page material it is local news and belongs there and susan reimer i like reading her column as well is not a page 2 column either and why are the column photos so large
7994015 i have been a big fan of kevin cowherd for years on monday morning i always looked forward to reading his column in the today section after i finished reading the news sections so i was very surprised to find his latest column with large picture on the front page although i enjoyed the column i do not believe it should be given prominence over news people want news on the front page
7994016 we wanted to give our columnists more prominence and we wanted the paper to have more personality our columnists produce some of the best written and most thought provoking work in the newspaper and we also wanted to create a greater sense of intimacy and more of a personal connection between the columnist and the reader the full body column pictures are one way to do that because it shows them as three dimensional figures

7994026 investigations by unama united nations assistance mission in afghanistan found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
7994027 toll is one of the highest for civilians killed in military action
7994028 the us led coalition had initially said only 30 taliban had died but acknowledged on tuesday that five civilians two women and three children were dead in the strikes that also killed a taliban target
7994029 the afghan council of ministers demanded a status of forces agreement which would stipulate that the authority and responsibilities of international forces be negotiated and they said that aerial bombing illegal detentions and house raids by international forces must be stopped
7994030 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7994031 the real strength of the insurgents lies not in their ability to ambush convoys or plant roadside bombs but in the parallel administration they have managed to establish in huge areas across the south and east of afghanistan there they make the law enforcing a harsh but sometimes welcome order while intimidating any dissenters their strategy is deliberate and long term

7994486 it could be anywhere from a couple of weeks to a major injury we dont know that yet jeff has some options but we dont know how bad it is and it could be through this weekend before we know for sure
7994487 ive always been confident hell be ready for the opener
7994488 well start to see how that goes one thing is we dont want to put him out there if hes not physically or mentally ready
7994489 its the place to do something fun and a little out of the box
7994490 its the biggest crowd and its what people are talking about i was fortunate to play and win in the audrey hepburn dress
7994491 for the real world you wear the same type of attire day or night i have a lot of tennis clothes and i dont separate them

7994493 okay boys we need to get the ball back clock is low foul jackson cause hes a free throw shooter
7994494 it aint no fun if the underdogs dont get none
7994495 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
7994496 it could be any location because one facility is now processing flight data for everybody
7994497 there are cancelations due to weather from the hurricane but not due to this

7994505 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
7994506 i would say some people thought we were going to die
7994507 for about half an hour no one told us anything we didnt know what was happening at all we were quite panicky
7994508 after half an hour we were told to take the oxygen mask off and then the plane landed and we were fine
7994509 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
7994510 they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
7994511 as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8000 feet where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off that they were diverting to limoges
7994512 the irish and french aviation authorities have been notified of this incident and a full investigation of this incident will be undertaken later today
7994513 i sent my mum a text phone message amp squo i love you and i am going down amp squo

7994515 pizza is one of the most widely eaten dishes in the world and it should never cost more than 3 50 5 99
7994516 we launched this initiative because pizza has become more and more expensive vis a vis the general surge in food prices and we want to help consumers and their families make ends meet each month
7994517 pizza is a poor mans dish and a passing fancy for the rich
7994518 tomorrow thursday we will give them away free to protest against those who are trying to trade on their price increase

7994525 break the georgian state undermine the fundamental values of georgia and to wipe georgia fron the map
7994526 this is the first attempt in europe after nazi germany and the stalinist soviet union to put a neighbouring state on its knees and to change the borders of europe by force
7994527 i dont think we should really be afraid of isolation
7994528 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
7994529 ive discussed with barack several nuances and details that he put in his program for space
7994530 the space program is the symbol of this nations technological prowess and barack understands that just as john kennedy understood it

7994536 while synagogue growth is always on the minds of rabbis this years survey reveals a heightened concern
7994537 shifting denominational affiliations and larger numbers of interfaith families are challenging synagogue growth and rabbis keenly recognize their role is not just about increasing ongoing membership participation but reaching out beyond current congregants by attracting a more diverse community
7994538 donations to global emergency causes such as relief for darfur through general civic organizations
7994539 the findings indicate that israel is still in the hearts and minds of rabbis but they are looking at broader issues as well
7994540 the battle to keep judaism relevant may be more of a concern right now but as the presidential election gets under way and global issues heat up it is clear the u s jewish community will be ready to act on behalf of israel and the synagogue is perhaps the key venue for israel activity education and advocacy
7994541 there continues to be confidence in the strength and security of the jewish community in the u s
7994542 however there is awareness that the jewish community worldwide is more vulnerable and that political action here can affect the attitude towards jews across the globe
7994543 but since it was lindsey i thought he wouldnt do this he couldnt do this to me
7994544 we have to take whatever steps we need to take on the benefit of bruce
7994545 the disaster of whats happened to him has been unbelievable
7994546 i wake up sometimes at nighttime wondering what im going to do
7994547 if i had never met lindsey i would never have been in this i would be living my little life with the little i had making things work and enjoying life
7994548 ive been burned by politicians before that i wanted to believe in and just didnt live up to it
7994549 and i was afraid to trust him and i was afraid to have hope when i first kind of became aware of him
7994550 i just said i cant deny how i feel about you barack obama i want you to be the president i want you in the white house i just heard the other day he just paid off his student loans two years ago and so when people talk about financial issues and the higher cost of education he really gets it i think hes the sort of person that inspires us all to be our best selves
7994551 were all out of touch how could we possibly have an awareness of what real americans feel and think and need because we just ride around in limos and i dont know buy diamonds all day long
7994552 im certainly not like that im a passionate american and thats what i am first and foremost

7994567 funding arrangements for schools that are riddled with anomalies and flaws
7994568 the only way out in the longer term is for a root and branch review of the arrangements involving all funding partners
7994569 1 5 billion for government schools would be required merely to reclaim the sector shares in place at the outset of the howard years
7994570 if continued they will result in a cut in real terms for the school system that educates the majority of australian children
7994571 howard government policies benefited non government schools by almost 3 billion in real terms a funding advantage of around 2 5 billion over the real increases provided for government schools
7994572 i thank god who has been with me through this gruelling election process i thank the voters
7994573 the message is clear we have made a demand for change for freedom and for justice
7994574 the people do not want to be exploited we want an economic order that protects all the people
7994575 yes of course we have lost we were the underdogs going into this race
7994576 this is a clear indication that people of all races have rejected the communal politics of barisan nasional it is a clear endorsement of our reform agenda we are on track to take over the government
7994577 i am predisposed to being here but i was surrounded by those whose werent and as they figeted in their seats coming late and leaving early i got their message we have to do a lot more to reach out welcome them in and then deliver on the promise once they come through the doors

7994582 at summer camps thousands of jewish teenagers from across the former soviet bloc gather for crash courses in jewish culture celebrating passover hanukkah and purim all in july even in poland there are now two jewish schools synagogues function in several major cities and there are at least four rabbis
7994583 interest in jewish culture became an identifying factor for people unhappy with the status quo and looking for ways to rebel whether against the government or their parents
7994584 the word jew still cuts conversation at the dinner table
7994585 human evolution can be pretty intense horrifying ironic and even hopeful some eastern europeans have not forgotten the concept of atonement woven into their culture by jews and the jewish revival is happening in nearby countries like estonia also

7994593 if you think youre true to your identity mr sohrab why do you dress like an urban american and not like a tehranian why do you cut your hair short why do you shave
7994594 there is a reason i have a big nose it was not decided when i turned 13 for me to have a big nose it was shaped over hundreds of years of evolution because the fittest nose for my ancestors and me has now been inherited to me
7994595 if youre cutting and breaking yourself for you only then obviously you have some sort of psychological disorder
7994596 so for whatever reason you have managed to falsely convince yourself that the way you were born is somehow defective or less perfect whatever that means when it comes to beauty
7994597 and to the people who are thinking to themselves i just want to look more like me just 30 years ago well i have news for you if youre unable to appreciate the natural change your body goes through with every step of aging then you too have a clear case of psychological disorder
7994598 if people were meant to look like they were 23 their whole life we would have 23 year olds being born and dying some time later just the way they looked
7994599 you obviously can not appreciate the beauty of age you can not see that an aged person is not judged internally or externally by how similar they look to a 23 year old and how often they have sex

7994603 this is about bringing leopard mac os x 10 5 to the masses
7994604 its not that people dont want to use mac os x but theyre not open spending an exorbitant amount of money for something thats essentially generic hardware
7994605 every single copy of the os is a purchased copy
7994606 despite the allegations that theres a master disc thats not the case and allegations that psystar has somehow modified mac os xs code to run on non apple systems thats also not the case
7994607 there is no modification of any proprietary code of apples
7994608 we purchase copies of mac os directly from apple or from an apple authorized dealer
7994609 no specific precedent but we wouldnt be filing this if we didnt believe we could support it
7994610 what we want to do is provide an alternative to apples hardware
7994611 were here to say thank you to hillary and to protest the fraud perpetrated on us by the democratic national committee
7994612 it wasnt a contest it was a foregone conclusion they the dnc leadership just decided that barack obama was going to win
7994613 its going to be the first time since 1976 that i havent voted i just dont trust obama i think hell do more harm than good
7994614 were here to tell the democratic leadership that its not okay to ignore 18 million voices
7994615 i dont trust obama he flip flops all the time we dont know anything about his past how do we know hes not some kind of militant im voting for mccain
7994616 theres a lot of us who feel pissed and angry at the party for the way hillary was treated there was a lot of sexism in the media and the whole process seemed rigged against her
7994617 at the moment i dont know who i am voting for i want to be able to forgive barack obama but what happened to hillary bugs me i dont know though that i could bring myself to vote for a republican
7994618 i was unhappy and upset that she lost but im going to be voting for obama in november
7994619 hes a brilliant leader and we have to have unity in the party to win the election
7994620 im disappointed hurt and angry about hillary but im not deluded
7994621 four more years of a bush presidency under mccain would be a disaster for our country
7994622 were not going to shoot ourselves in the foot in november hillary rocks but any true democrat will vote for obama
7994623 get your hands off of me you two balled bitch
7994624 i think its no secret and ive said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process
7994625 what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7994626 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together over this period of time
7994627 so we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we know what is in israel and what is in palestine that is ultimately the goal
7994628 initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7994629 which still continue and which without a doubt are the main obstacle in the political process
7994630 just because we have not yet succeeded does not mean we have failed
7994631 the coming weeks will be decisive for the peace process we are at a crossroads and the efforts and the meetings will continue in order to build on the ideas presented for the first time today
7994632 will continue efforts to reach a historic agreement by the end of the bush administration
7994633 i would like to suggest to my partners not to use it as an excuse and i know they are not using it as an excuse but i understand their frustration sometimes
7994634 there were some small activities but they will not influence the ability to negotiate nor the future borders of the palestinian state
7994635 special attention must be paid to women who make up the majority of farmers throughout africa and in many other parts of the developing world

7994638 especially now that it leads to thousands of hits on our website
7994639 our dream is to have a larger studio space for product designing and building and also to spend a little less time in the store so that when we are here we are in love with it

7994723 so it wouldnt be surprising to see a market where there are higher levels
7994724 weve never believed the realtors research but we didnt have firepower to refute them
7994725 theyve always put out their own numbers which promote their services
7994726 theres no transparency in their studies you cant look at their data and how they analyze it now we have independent research that vindicates our position
7994727 i think sellers should ask themselves three questions are they willing to take the risk in dealing with unscreened people coming through their home do they have the time do they understand all the paperwork required disclosures and laws and regulations in their area selling a home without a real estate agent is like representing yourself in court
7994728 if this works completely then it means that he wont have to have an operation
7994729 now an operation that would be quite successful for many people for a person in his weakened state it could probably be fatal
7994730 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
7994731 this has nothing to do with whats going on now

7994741 my concern now is to improve how we play we can play better liege were good in the first leg but we were really poor if we play at our real level it will be very difficult for them
7994742 liege are probably the hardest opponents we have faced in the champions league qualifiers but we know we are better than them even though they played well in the first leg
7994743 i am not even considering the option of liverpool not qualifying for the group stages i am just thinking about winning
7994744 at anfield we are confident we can win and i expect us to win the key is to be calm and have confidence in your team and the ability of your players we have the players who can win this type of game
7994745 his career is so dead that theyll soon be erecting statues of him for pidgeons to sh t on
7994746 rovers will not be pursuing an interest in bolton goalkeeper ali al habsi
7994747 rovers officials who confirm approaching wanderers about the omani international were told that he was unavailable and have now moved on
7994748 the two front lads were very very good for an hour
7994749 they kept the ball better than what we have done and that allowed us to get forward and play football
7994750 the goals were pleasing especially rics goal that was a special goal
7994751 he had an operation when the season closed and weve got to be careful with him because hes a special player
7994752 dubai amp co global strategies for doing business in the gulf states

7994756 have my friends posted something that im not seeing the news feed is cluttered right now with people i dont care about
7994757 if hillary was chosen as the democratic vice presidential nominee this would have electrified
7994758 i agree but i cant believe you are saying this you demonized hillary
7994759 i t would have been electrifying in my view had sen barack obama picked sen hillary clinton
7994760 if hillary was chosen this would have electrified this place the democratic national convention
7994761 i agree but i cant believe youre saying this you demonized hillary

7994766 right wing blogging from a uk student a fresh perspective on a plethora of events with a healthy interest in shelf stacking to boot
7994767 one of the more depressing aspects of blogging and the modern world is seeing reams of text on a page the thunder dragons mixture of politics and fun posts with good illustrations and quickly made points makes his blog an accessible and fun place to discuss and think about politics the thunderdragon is one of the rising stars of conservative blogging
7994768 already an a lister technical whiz thunder dragon shows that not all a listers are stuck up stats groupies whod sell their grandmothers for more traffic and hes on iain dales list for a reason hes simply a fine blogger scoring highly on the ten point dale criteria and with his finger always on the political pulse hes also the technical brains behind blogpower along with ian at imagined community

7994770 men gud v re takk som gir oss seier ved v r herre jesus kristus
7994771 traditional mass media is not a growth business and so to continue to resonate and be relevant broadcast stations need to basically embrace digital media including the web youll actually continue to have a healthy viable broadcast business but you have to accept its not growing and its becoming less and less relevant to particular target audiences
7994772 the networks and the stations have to recognize that theyre in the video information and entertainment delivery business a broadcast station limits what they can actually do
7994773 lets say on television you get a 20 cost per thousand rate fifty cents a click is equal to 500 cost per thousand you can see how much more expensive it is but the difference is theres some sort of action
7994774 im particularly pleased with the increased participation of minority students who not only had record numbers of participants but outperformed their national counterparts on the reading and math sections of the exam

7994777 juande ramos i have not yet met it seems like he will call me but i know for sure he is very interested in my services
7994778 the remarkable feeling of proximity between people and nations is the unmistakable reality of our globalized world

7994788 okay thats it for the day well pick up there tomorrow
7994789 no mom read some more just one more chapter please
7994790 hey lets watch this george melies film or this charlie chaplin film
7994791 listen to the worship wonk who will tell you exactly what to do
7994792 los etarras viven mal y no son cobardes simplemente est n acosados
7994793 yes honey i am here its okay whatevers wrong were gonna make it right
7994794 may angles on the wings of night watch over you until the morning light
7994795 its a little simple for my tastes but itll do
7994796 or did you lose your key witness she taunts before stomping away he goes outside and sighs he gets a call from avas treatment center about a new therapy they want to start they fax the paperwork to his office as he arrives he looks it over and shakes his head
7994797 i may not know what im talking about but youre a family man
7994798 alan is not on a spiritual journey hes trying to steal my company
7994799 maybe pretty much anything can be ms related because your brain pretty much controls everything
7994800 hes returned the ball before in college as well as being a receiver weve been a little nicked up at that spot so well have a little look see
7994801 i saw him out there yesterday running on the side and that is the first step mentally i think he will be just fine hes a pretty sharp guy he picks up stuff pretty quick and the questions he asks in meetings you can tell he has an understanding of what is going on
7994802 i always look back to the 2003 season and i dont know how many plays i ran with moose and steve and ricky proehl until that halftime of the first game
7994803 i didnt run many plays with those guys i think a lot of that in my opinion is on the quarterback watching film and watching them in practice and watching body language and learning how they run certain routes you just try to get familiar with them in that way
7994804 you can either get something out of it or nothing on a day like this and i believe we got something
7994805 dont screw around and get where you need to be and give them good looks there wasnt a lot of repeated plays in practice sometimes you see that a lot on the inside practices i dont think we had one today you begin to see the makeup of a team on days like this
7994806 how to become more memorable and make stronger connections with your audience
7994807 he does have an interesting story to tell as governor being somewhat bipartisan definitely addressing the economic issues
7994808 im probably im closer to obama although i would argue maybe the old mccain back in 2000 it seems to be the john mccain that is running this time
7994809 there might have been others that might excite the crowd a little more and draw some of the contrasts against mccain

7994825 the cardinal has not made clear why religion should get a free pass
7994826 discussions on the devolution of policing and justice have progressed well in the preparation for government committee the governments have requested the parties to continue these discussions so as to agree the necessary administrative arrangements to create a new policing and justice department it is our view i e the view of the two governments that the implementation of the agreement published today should be sufficient to build the community confidence necessary for the assembly to request the devolution of criminal justice and policing from the british government by may 2008
7994827 there is no definitive date for the devolution of policing and justice powers we remain of the unshakable view that those powers can only be transferred whenever there is the required community confidence

7994830 this charge of fiddling while rome burns was a problem which heaney discusses in his essay the interesting case of nero chekhovs cognac and a knocker where he recalls how he and david hammond felt unable to record a tape of songs against the immediate backdrop of explosions in belfast
7994831 we aimed to challenge sectarian divisions in the north of ireland to put
7994832 davy is in that well worn phrase a man of many parts but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and the uniqueness of david hammond is his midas touch the way he can discern art and poetry in the commonplace and above all the way in which he effortlessly explores i would almost say creates a common ground on which irishmen and women of every tradition and disposition no matter how cantankerous or self regarding we may be in other areas can meet each other and re discover a vital part of ourselves in all of this his wife eileen has played a quiet but essential part their home in belfast has for years been a magnet for cultural waifs and strays of every description an embassy of song its warmth and hospitality a standing rebuke to the image of the dour wee north that is most prevalent among people who have never crossed the border
7994833 the singers house by seamus heaney to david hammond people here used to believe that drowned souls lived in seals at spring tides they might change shape they loved music and swam in for a singer who might stand at the end of summer in the mouth of a whitewashed turf shed his shoulder to the jamb his song a rowboat far out in evening when i came here first you were always singing a hint of the clip of the pick in your winnowing climb and attack raise it again man we still believe what we hear
7994834 its very clear we need to deliver any agreements that weve had with the dup and the two governments the devolution of policing and justice has to happen we in our party have worked for years and are very committed to the process under way but we need to start seeing results
7994835 the oireachtas could ratify lisbon subject to a number of opt outs if necessary for example the charter of fundamental rights the solidarity clause transfer of certain matters to qualified majority voting and the inclusion of new competences such as energy security climate change and tourism
7994836 mep mary lou mcdonald has said if the irish government secures a better deal for ireland at european level only then is there an argument for a new referendum those of us on the no side want specific new additional points in the treaty and we want specific cast iron legal views on taxation she said
7994837 a succession of anti family anti life and other anti christian decisions by brussels has made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive support for europe in the lisbon referendum
7994838 concerns were expressed regarding abortion despite the specific assurances in terms of irelands legal arrangements in this regard
7994839 the overwhelming feeling expressed in more than 90 messages posted about the topic was that finding a northern ireland anthem could benefit the team
7994840 i heard poots spouting some rubbish about how northern ireland fans wouldnt stand for a change how dare he speak for all fans why not ask them first
7994841 for those who think it will diminish their britishness watch how hard sinn fein fight against this and ask yourselves why
7994842 mr poots is more and more increasingly out of touch with grassroots unionism i resent the fact that he would label anyone that disagrees with him as a lesser unionist
7994843 me being proud of being northern irish and wanting us to use a northern irish anthem doesnt make me any less british than you or devalue my unionism and not all northern ireland fans are unionists anyway you fool
7994844 poots reaction was totally predictable its just a stupid im more british than you points scoring exercise
7994845 its a small step in raising this important issue and it deserves discussion at all levels no matter the outcome
7994846 good on you basil dup sinn fein axis not in favour what a surprise
7994847 this would be a very positive step in my eyes the one and only chant i hate hearing at windsor is the old no surrender as it offends many of our own players i am pro union but that is neither here nor there and has nothing to do with supporting all 11 players wearing our green shirt
7994848 as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business
7994849 the refusal is based upon his felony conviction as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business he does not get a waiver to entry despite his conviction as other convicted ira members have
7994850 he could apply again but the likelihood of his being able to enter the states is slim to none given both his record and the political climate
7994851 there is a famous story from seoul in 1988 that there were so many used condoms on the roof terrace of the british teams residential block the night after the swimming concluded that the british olympic association sent out an edict banning outdoor sex here in beijing organisers have realised that such prohibitions are about as useful as banning breathing and have instead handed out thousands of free condoms to the athletes if you cant stop em at least make it safe

7994853 rania wannous spokeswoman for visit london said the issue has been

7994857 there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis
7994858 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
7994859 i think there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis policing and justice devolution can only occur if there is sufficient public confidence in the ability of politicians to handle such a sensitive matter i think the question is this will these remarks by sinn fein convince anyone out there that this is mature politics when people are threatening to pull the whole thing down
7994860 bearing in mind the statement went through their official press office one is left with the impression its a bit of kite flying by sinn f in these comments were not off the cuff or out of the blue
7994861 comments such as these are clearly part of the pathetic choreography surrounding the so called policing and justice saga members of mr caol ins own party are disenchanted not only by the failure of their leaders to secure the devolution of such powers to stormont but also by their cosy relationship with the dup
7994862 martin mcguinness is on holiday and sinn fein has no interest in responding to demands by reg empey
7994863 the criminal cases review commission recommended that his case go back to the court of appeal which this summer cleared him
7994864 aided and abetted by secret sects satanic groups and new age movements
7994865 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7994866 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7994867 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7994868 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
7994869 last saturday night there was a rocket attack in the middle of lisnaskea co fermanagh in which several police officers were nearly murdered there was no coordinated political response an emergency executive meeting was convened to address floods while the attempted murder of police went unmentioned if there was a rocket attack on garda in dublin city centre on saturday night brian cowen would call an emergency meeting of political and security figures to agree a strategy to deal with the threat while i dont want to over emphasise the dissident threat they are intent on killing police and there could be civilian deaths too
7994870 the psni as a political statement and thus they judge the psnis success not by its effectiveness but by its existence and that sad to say makes the psni the latest in a long line of political police forces here
7994871 i talked to mr blatter about how we could find a solution to this and i am confident fifa will give the assurances that the scottish welsh and irish associations want
7994872 i am also confident that when the people of scotland wales and
7994873 we all want to see a great britain football team its the right thing to do to have a successful olympics
7994874 gordon smith the sfas chief executive has spoken to the prime minister about team gb but we are unlikely to alter our position and remain opposed to the concept of a great britain football team
7994875 how can you have a great britain football team which includes northern ireland would you therefore support changing the name to team uk
7994876 it is clear that sinn fein has always known that no agreement was reached

7994915 bearing in mind the statement went through their official press office one is left with the impression its a bit of kite flying by sinn f in these comments were not off the cuff or out of the blue
7994916 comments such as these are clearly part of the pathetic choreography surrounding the so called policing and justice saga members of mr caol ins own party are disenchanted not only by the failure of their leaders to secure the devolution of such powers to stormont but also by their cosy relationship with the dup
7994917 martin mcguinness is on holiday and sinn fein has no interest in responding to demands by reg empey
7994918 the criminal cases review commission recommended that his case go back to the court of appeal which this summer cleared him
7994919 aided and abetted by secret sects satanic groups and new age movements
7994920 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7994921 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7994922 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7994923 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
7994924 last saturday night there was a rocket attack in the middle of lisnaskea co fermanagh in which several police officers were nearly murdered there was no coordinated political response an emergency executive meeting was convened to address floods while the attempted murder of police went unmentioned if there was a rocket attack on garda in dublin city centre on saturday night brian cowen would call an emergency meeting of political and security figures to agree a strategy to deal with the threat while i dont want to over emphasise the dissident threat they are intent on killing police and there could be civilian deaths too
7994925 the psni as a political statement and thus they judge the psnis success not by its effectiveness but by its existence and that sad to say makes the psni the latest in a long line of political police forces here
7994926 i talked to mr blatter about how we could find a solution to this and i am confident fifa will give the assurances that the scottish welsh and irish associations want
7994927 i am also confident that when the people of scotland wales and
7994928 we all want to see a great britain football team its the right thing to do to have a successful olympics
7994929 gordon smith the sfas chief executive has spoken to the prime minister about team gb but we are unlikely to alter our position and remain opposed to the concept of a great britain football team
7994930 how can you have a great britain football team which includes northern ireland would you therefore support changing the name to team uk
7994931 it is clear that sinn fein has always known that no agreement was reached
7994932 the cardinal has not made clear why religion should get a free pass
7994933 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7994934 i just dont think he gets it he is out of touch i dont think he realizes what ordinary american families are going through
7994935 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get our country back on the right path
7994936 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7994937 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
7994938 didnt always comport myself in the way that i wanted to
7994939 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7994940 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7994941 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7994942 barack obama has re opened a wound among american catholics by picking a pro abortion catholic politician
7994943 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7994944 likewise none of us should accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7994945 as reported in todays new york times 64 percent of americans reject abortion on demand yet only 23 percent of the delegates do
7994946 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
7994947 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
7994948 on issues such as genocide universal health care education workers rights and violence against women
7994949 i believe in his ideals and his proposals to lead this nation hes been a fighter for the hispanic community
7994950 i am so glad that i found trivita as a strong business model to follow their idea of buying customers maps instead of the usual way of conducting a network marketing business by buying leads has produced such a rich roi that i cannot see myself pursuing any online business in another way
7994951 trivita is not just another home business deal it is a real way to improve your business profitability the roi on money invested will become much more substantial if one follows the guidelines set forth by trivita and consistently buy customers each month
7994952 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
7994953 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
7994954 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

7995059 positive but one thing feeds into another philip sutton but the thing is that the speed with which that change could occur could be quite dramatic like its not a question of hundreds of years its probably once the thing becomes highly unstable its probably a process that could last maybe a couple of decades at the most i guess jason bradford right okay so besides ice loss what other major indicators are there going on that climate change is reaching certain tipping points philip sutton okay just quickly on the ice loss its easy to toss that away if you like to say its just a bit of ice loss and theres sea level rise

7995150 we used to argue that a lot of the variability up to the late 1990s was induced by changes in the winds natural changes not obviously related to global warming
7995151 but changes in the last few years make you have to question that i u2019m much more open to the idea that we might have passed a point where its becoming essentially irreversible
7995152 natural variations could turn around and counteract the greenhouse gas forced change perhaps stabilizing the ice for a bit
7995153 eventually the natural variations would again reinforce the human driven change perhaps leading to even more rapid retreat

7995176 snow melting is very connected to surface temperature change so its likely warmer temperatures are at the root of what weve observed in antarctica
7995177 microwave instruments are very sensitive to wet snow and can see through clouds day and night allowing us to separate melting from dry snow to better understand when where and for how long melting took place
7995178 persistent melting on the ross ice shelf is something we should not lose sight of because of the ice shelfs role as a brake system for glaciers
7995179 ice shelves are thick ice masses covering coastal land with extended areas that float on the sea keeping warmer marine air at a distance from glaciers and preventing a greater acceleration of melting the ross ice shelf acts like a freezer door separating ice on the inside from warmer air on the outside so the smaller that door becomes the less effective it will be at protecting the ice inside from melting and escaping
7995180 satellites have given us a remarkable ability to monitor the melting trends of glaciers and ice shelves on this immense and largely unknown continent and to watch for unusual occurrences like those observed in 2005
7995181 through this space based perspective we are really only just beginning to understand the nature of the changes that are occurring in antarctica and what these changes will mean for antarcticas future contributions to sea level

7995275 the provider performance measurement and reporting standards support transparency in health care and help purchasers and consumers get access to information they need to make important health care choices

7995277 we are pleased that urac is seeking additional comments as it works to makes its standards consistent with the principles of the patient charter for physician performance measurement reporting and tiering programs
7995278 having independent review of programs that publicly report on physician performance is critical and being sure that those reviews are based on widely agreed upon principles that promote accuracy consistency fairness and consumer friendly information means that both patients and doctors can rely on those results

7995280 a new age in dementia care turning evidence into practice
7995281 we expect the summit to challenge working professionals to take a new look at what they are doing in dementia care while sharing with them ways to turn research into practice
7995282 the fulfillment of jeffersons new vision of practice the living laboratory will take what carahs researchers have learned and continue to learn and train others both healthcare professionals and lay caregivers as to best practices in the field so this newfound knowledge can do the most good
7995283 our aim is to translate research into real world service
7995284 the ultimate goal is to provide older adults with functional difficulties and those with dementia and their caregivers access to the best care possible
7995285 our it committee with help from our management company qhr developed a thorough evaluation process which resulted in our selecting hms after all the time spent in site visits reviewing several different systems and analyzing rfps i am confident that hms was the right choice for us

7995288 adversely impact our local residents who suffer from long term pain
7995289 dr martinez is a dedicated caring physician who believes her first loyalty is to her chronic pain patients and she intends to fight the department of health with every resource she has
7995290 we are extremely pleased with this opportunity to evaluate the role of our atherox products in this important indication
7995291 we are at a point in this country where a national campaign is needed to help people realize that they have the opportunity and the ability to make positive and realistic changes in their daily lifestyle choices
7995292 the solution to our health care crisis is prevention and that will only happen when at risk individuals are informed motivated and challenged with a positive realistic and forgiving opportunity to change their behavior
7995293 important benefits accrue for our members partners when they are able to promote a new culture of wellness among their employees their families and the communities they serve we like the fact that lonestart recognizes that we all have the responsibility and the opportunity to make wellness available achievable and sustainable
7995294 we came to realize that most of us want to be well and if we have a reasonable expectation of success we will make positive changes in our daily choices regarding our health
7995295 for the past three years lonestart wellness has been making a difference in several of our member hospitals they have demonstrated that people will respond to the opportunity to make positive choices when those choices are based on valid and easy to apply behavior modification principles as they work toward establishing long term behavior change what started as a grassroots effort has grown into an effective strategy for lasting change based on individual accountability and teamwork
7995296 we are all stakeholders in this effort and together we can turn the epidemic of obesity and inactivity around and reduce our risk for serious chronic illnesses at the same time we can effectively reduce our health care costs and the impact those costs have on our economy
7995297 that 314 billion is roughly equivalent to federal and state spending on the medicaid program each year
7995298 by promoting our individual and collective responsibility to change unhealthy behaviors as a personal and patriotic duty each of us becomes empowered to make our own long term health a priority while at the same time dramatically reducing the burden currently being placed on our health care system lonestart wellness will continue to demonstrate that with imagination vision and initiative a low cost grassroots effort can move us toward a permanent new culture of wellness
7995299 it is probably not advisable to drive before six weeks after bunion surgery on the right foot our research shows that the reflexes and the power required to brake suddenly in an emergency is fully returned only at six weeks in the post operative period
7995300 however it is extremely important for all patients to discuss when they can return to driving with their surgeon after having any type of surgery to their foot
7995301 before we started this project we contacted multiple government agencies and insurance companies to find out what advice patients are given about driving after foot surgery and were very surprised to learn that no guidance existed
7995302 we found this not only surprising but also unsatisfactory anecdotal experience told us that patients are generally allowed to drive after a period of six weeks after other lower limb surgery but no research existed before our study to support this advice

7995492 during a vacant see period the power to authorize the issuing of new stamps or coins falls as with any other activity of the state into the hands of the cardinal camerlengo the head of the papal household for a brief period during which it is nevertheless necessary to reaffirm the continuity of the life of the state without interruption through the issuance of new stamps and printing of new coins
7995493 the announcement of the passing of john paul ii filled me and my collaborators not only with sorrow but also with a certain anxiety because we would need to make these stamps three in total very quickly but 26 years had passed since the last vacant see i vaguely remembered it my collaborators were just kids and many had never lived through one at all so there was a generational gap we had to overcome we had clear difficulties in beginning to design these stamps
7995494 finally some frescos from the apostolic room which one of our collaborators just happened to see one day came to our rescue
7995495 should be immediately pulled out of circulation they are no longer valid they can later be collected but they can no longer be used as postage
7995496 here are some things i thought were interesting that i encountered last week
7995497 because jt said i should shower with the people i love
7995498 shower the people you love with love not shower with the people you love now get out of my house
7995499 silly neil its cashmere on sale at the gap for only 19 99
7995500 committing yourself to one job for a life time is a different notion for this generation
7995501 the young generation is not as attracted to the church as in previous generations
7995502 there was a need for one parish not to have a resident priest for a six month period for six months the priest will not live there new arrangements will be made once we complete our dialogues
7995503 its a situation we are now finding we have to do more and more
7995504 it shows up starkly in the country diocese in metropolitan places and melbourne it does not appear as stark the country parishes are an hour and a half away which makes it look a lot worse
7995505 is a big incentive to buy now versus later when you most likely wont have that option for you
7995506 it makes a lot of sense for builders to do a lot of promotions on that
7995507 were trying to let everyone know hey this is going away
7995508 we are a catholic church ministered by two catholic priests from a community which has many leaders in the catholic church
7995509 we do have a radical point of view in terms of christian prayer
7995510 and we have to confront the issues that the archbishop has raised
7995511 the information ive got is that this all happened because the statue was reported by an extremely conservative right wing member of the church
7995512 when people take notice of a person of that sort then these kinds of things happen as a reaction
7995513 i think a church that refuses homosexual people as part of the church is not catholic and not christian
7995514 if were going to be doing what we do in the tradition of jesus then theres no basis for refusing anyone
7995515 the archbishop hopes wisdom prevails in south brisbane and i do too
7995516 we need to allow the differences of believers the church needs more pastoring not policing
7995517 these actions which are prejudicial to peoples dignity and freedom and compromise peaceful coexistence
7995518 how could they the government not foresee ahead of time such a situation and take the necessary preventive measures to avert this large scale mayhem
7995519 shameful for india within the international community it is a blot on indias image the international community might end up seeing us as a nation where the government is slow to act and police is ineffective
7995520 the indian church immediately condemned the murder of the guruji the church has never been a party to any violence the vendetta against christians is pure madness
7995521 our women religious have given their lives to empower the same people who are now assaulting them
7995522 our nuns have given dignity to these people through the social ministry of the church and today they are brutalised by this senseless mob this is diabolical
7995523 it was painful to see that the people we serve for whom we are doing good work can do such things we must never the less forgive and go on with the eyes focused on our mission
7995524 pope benedict xvi said that the blessed mother teresa was a real disciple of christ but without the cross there is no jesus can we be disciples of christ without paying the price like him on the cross
7995525 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7995526 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
7995527 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
7995528 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
7995529 at the end of our time together many people especially some of the newer bishops said that they had been surprised by the amount of convergence they had seen
7995530 and there can be no doubt that practically all who were present sincerely wanted the communion to stay together
7995531 the conference design group believed strongly that the chief need of our communion at the moment was the rebuilding of relationships the rebuilding of trust in one another and of confidence in our anglican identity
7995532 i believe that the conference succeeded in doing this to a very remarkable degree more than most people expected
7995533 cannot hold in tension convictions and practices that are incompatible and so not patent of reconciliation
7995534 damage the life and witness of anglican churches as much in the global south as in north america and in other provinces that have followed the lead of the episcopal church
7995535 how far the intensified sense of belonging together will help mutual restraint in such matters as same sex blessings remains to be seen
7995536 the case against tebano is going forward when a motion to dismiss is made it holds up the action now that the case has been denied we will conduct depositions and move toward trial
7995537 as have all prior decisions in all the other courts involving this attorney
7995538 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7995539 like many other citizens of this nation i was shocked to learn that the speaker of the house of representatives of the united states of america would make the kind of statements that were made to mr tom brokaw of nbc tv on sunday august 24 2008
7995540 what the speaker had to say about theologians and their positions regarding abortion was not only misinformed it was also and especially utterly incredible in this day and age
7995541 marvelous beings manifestly clearly and obviously are as they smile and wave into the world outside the womb
7995542 in simplest terms they are human beings with an inalienable right to live a right that the speaker of the house of representatives is bound to defend at all costs for the most basic of ethical reasons they are not parts of their mothers and what they are depends not at all upon the opinions of theologians of any faith
7995543 anyone who dares to defend that they may be legitimately killed because another human being chooses to do so or for any other equally ridiculous reason should not be providing leadership in a civilized democracy worthy of the name
7995544 nancy pelosi misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
7995545 the church teaches that from the time of conception fertilization each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with respect for the fundamental right to life
7995546 the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops
7995547 given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
7995548 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
7995549 you shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish
7995550 from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
7995551 ardent practicing catholics will quickly learn from the historical record that from apostolic times the christian tradition overwhelmingly held that abortion was grievously evil
7995552 all of us there were in the same boat when it came to dealing with the weather so it actually brought us together as a group
7995553 it wet and soggy but the atmosphere was just fantastic in spite of getting soaked people were filled with joy hope and radiance at the end of the weekend
7995554 we were blown away by the generous response to our call for help we had hundreds of skilled volunteers appear on the scene for every task
7995555 as well as getting help locally the western brigade of the irish army from the custume barracks in athlone erected tents and gave us beds and tables for the weekend everyone has been fantastic to us and we are deeply indebted to them
7995556 when he was in clonmacnoise pope john paul ii said the walls of these ruins are charged with a great mission he wanted to encourage a renewal of the faith in this area and perhaps we saw the start of that last weekend
7995557 ive made wonderful friends through youth 2000 and ive found that its a fantastic way to meet other young people if anyones curious about it id say that they should come along to a meeting theres nothing to lose and everything to gain
7995558 hes very committed to helping working class folks and poor people and thats what catholic social teaching is all about
7995559 i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7995560 im a practicing catholic and it is the biggest dilemma for me in terms of comporting my religious and cultural views with my political responsibility
7995561 the only means by which in this heterogeneous society of ours we can reach some general accommodation on what is a religiously charged and publicly charged debate
7995562 biden has opposed government funding for abortion so basically he doesnt want to put women and doctors in jail he doesnt want to criminalize abortions but nor does he want the government to pay for them
7995563 our catholic institutions will not honor catholic politicians who take pro abortion legislative positions
7995564 im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
7995565 something tells me that if church leaders give biden grief over his abortion record hell give it right back

7995568 if an increasingly overworked it staff is more likely to make mistakes and configuration errors are the cause of security exposures in virtual servers then it management must consider how they can mitigate this risk
7995569 as more of the production workload becomes virtualized and those managing virtual servers continue to be overwhelmed it is apparent that automated configuration control must play a larger role to ensure appropriate server configuration and adequate security

7995597 a tariff reduction lowers the marginal cost of production by reducing the cost of imported materials
7995598 strong increases in the manufacturing exports of developing countries particularly those participating in ipns may have taken place without commensurate increases in incomes and value added
7995599 expansion in sectors benefiting from liberalization requires investment in skills and equipment rather than simply reshuffling and redeploying existing labor and equipment
7995600 the positive effects on the wage gap through changes in tradable input prices seem substantially larger than those through changes in nontradable input prices
7995601 strong medium term exchange rate movements create price level shocks which make it difficult to realize the wage norm a strong depreciation in a country with a high import quota pushes up the domestic price level to such an extent that real wages fall to unacceptable levels
7995602 employees and unions in such industries are in a weak position as wage increases below the wage norm destroy jobs
7995603 if this dyke breaks and nominal wages start to fall a deflationary wage spiral and a deflationary demand constellation will stimulate each other and lead to a cumulative deflationary process
7995604 to build up domestic capabilities to promote new sectors either independently or in association with foreign capital
7995605 any dollar sent to washington or london or bonn is a dollar not available for attacking poverty at home
7995606 trade sanctions are often ineffective because trade with the sanctioned countries is profitable so firms always try to circumvent the sanctions
7995607 to rules that support the development of infant export industries as well as the links between the dynamic export sector and other domestic activities and thus domestic market integration
7995608 middle income countries should open up their markets to the least developed countries and should be allowed to extend preferences to one another without extending them to the rich countries so that they need not fear that imports from those countries might kill their nascent industries
7995609 if the goal of social movements is to construct a world that balances liberal economic priorities with egalitarian values such an aim only stands a chance of being accomplished if workers organisations play a large part in the struggle

7995635 the original books and early adaptations had only relatively minimal pieces like the modified attach case in from russia with love however the gadgets took on a more spectacular profile in the film version of goldfinger and its tremendous success encouraged the following films to have bond supplied with still more equipment for instance it became an expected scene in each film where q would present and demonstrate bonds assigned tools for the mission and it was a near guarantee that each and every piece would be invaluable to bond in the field in this sense bond gadgets became a prime example of the literary technique of chekhovs gun fans eventually complained that the use of gadgets became excessive in the roger moore films particularly in moonraker and subsequent productions struggled to find a balance in which gadgets could have a place without giving the impression that the character unduly depended on them or using stories that arbitrarily included situations that exactly fit the use of the gadgets assigned

7995649 we deserved to go through and the players are all excited about being in the pot with the likes of chelsea and liverpool
7995650 our centre backs were immaculate and deserve credit for keeping quality forwards like nicky and dele adebola quiet
7995651 we created the best three or four chances of the game and gave a performance that included effort concentration quality and thought
7995652 we only played for 10 minutes and they outplayed us for 80 so they deserve to go through
7995653 maybe we should have made some changes from saturday because the effort wasnt there tonight we showed no quality
7995654 our crosses into the box and our finishing were both poor and so crewe deserve their victory
7995655 im asking people to step up to the plate and when they get their chance to go and take it ive got to say that from one to 11 tonight they all performed
7995656 it shows that we have a very strong squad of players here and competition brings out the quality in people
7995657 i thought luciano becchio led the line fantastically and that some of the combinations in the middle of the park and some of the movement in the final third was excellent
7995658 quite honestly we couldnt cope with the front lads once the second goal went in it was disappointing to say the least
7995659 if you defend like that youre going to get beat against any level of opposition and i thought the two centre forwards bullied our defenders from start to finish
7995660 im not used to coming to leeds and losing i usually enjoy coming here and putting one over on them but they thoroughly deserved it
7995661 there was so much work to do during the shoot and there were so many fires that needed putting out that there wasnt much time to sit and acknowledge the reality of working with him

7995663 all i can say is that i think this movie is going to be worth the wait its blessed with a wonderful optimism and an incredibly alive and invested cast while the visual effects are gonna be unbelievable the movie is working right now with only 50 of our 1 000 plus visual effects finished its funny its scary its dramatic emotional and entertaining all without having the stuff youd think a movie called star trek would require that to me is exciting

7995733 digital billboards and digital signage networks in retail are driving the rapid expansion of outdoor out of home advertising rivaling the internet as the fastest growing advertising medium whats fueling this growth the ability to reach elusive consumers while they are out of home and especially while they are shopping the ability to customize each message to audiences at any location and even at any area within a location is another unique value for marketers that said a number of challenges still prevent the digital out of home from joining the ranks of mainstream media while screens are the most visible component of digital signage the critical part of any network is the software that powers it one of the obstacles to faster growth has been the lack of software platforms that could accommodate the necessary functionality without being cost prohibitive to network owners

7995736 traditional ad budgets have been going down but spending has remained stable this shows where the money is going
7995737 there is a lack of standards in these new areas
7995738 digital out of home advertising is getting recall rates as high as or higher than traditional mediums but there are few studies on this theyre going to need more and deeper metrics the bar is being raised across the board
7995739 whose most recent forecast for u s spending has out of home spending growing by 11 2 percent this year to 7 83 billion
7995740 11 3 percent to 8 71 billion and in 2010 it will grow another 11 5 percent to 9 72 billion thats against 3 7 percent growth this year for the entire u s ad economy which is down from the 4 1 percent growth zenithoptimedia forecast back in december its forecasting even slower growth in 2009 and 2010 by 2 1 percent and 2 2 percent zenithoptimedia is forecasting that worldwide out of home spending will grow 9 4 percent this year 8 0 percent in 2009 and 8 3 percent in 2010 zenithoptimedia senior publications executive anne austin defines out of home as including all outdoor advertising from billboards to bus shelters and other forms of alternative media just last month the outdoor advertising association of america reported that 2007 ooh spending had risen 7 percent over 2006 to 7 28 billion
7995741 out of home is a sleeping giant it is being kicked by technology its being rustled by measurements its being awakened in a way thats very close to what the internet is experiencing right now it provides us with an event in a local market that were able to build launches around its got the best of both worlds its a national medium that can be localized in a way that allows you to geo target you can now tailor your ads using digital boards in a way thats never been done before with dayparting there is now the opportunity to reach a certain audience while theyre traveling in close proximity to whatever it is youre great you can tell a story over time with a lot of little simple messages that add up to a big story

7995743 deze problemen los je niet op met een lokale benadering strooi de mensen toch geen zand in de ogen een verbinding e17 liefkenshoek blijft noodzakelijk
7995744 wij zijn uiteraard bekommerd om de leefbaarheid en de mobiliteitsproblemen in onze regio
7995745 wij staan achter alle initiatieven om het spoor en de binnenvaart te stimuleren bedoeling is ooit naar een verkeersverhouding te komen van 40 40 20 40 wegvervoer 40 binnenvaart 20 spoor maar dan zullen spoor en binnenvaart nog een tandje moeten bijsteken
7995746 maar hoe serieus we daar ook op aansturen het absolute aantal vrachtwagens zal door de economische groei nog toenemen zelfs als we dat marktaandeel onder de 40 procent zouden krijgen
7995747 de snel groeiende verkeersstromen rond antwerpen hebben absoluut niet alleen te maken met de haven verre van het belangrijkste deel is transit door de antwerpse regio en door vlaanderen cru gezegd als rotterdam en zeebrugge groeien dan merken wij dat hier ook op de ring rond antwerpen
7995748 precies daarom doet we vanuit alfaport uitdrukkelijk een oproep stop met oplossingen vanuit een lokale benadering de enige zinvolle benadering kan alleen maar vanuit een helikopterperspectief als alfaport bekijken wij alles uiteraard vanuit de haven wij dringen er op aan de zaken ruimer te bekijken vanuit het logistiek vlaanderenperspectief dat is het toch waar de vlaamse overheid op inzet
7995749 vanuit die vaststelling betreuren we deze wase studie wat de wase gemeenten voorstellen is g n oplossing het is geen oplossing voor het transitverkeer het is geen oplossing voor de haven het is geen oplossing voor het waasland volgens ons moet de verbinding liefkenshoek n17 er komen de voorgestelde nbaansweg naar de baan antwerpen gent is totaal ontoereikend voor de haven of voor het transitverkeer gaan we daar dan het havenverkeer van de ene verkeerslichten naar de andere laten rijden bovendien zou dit nog de verkeersdruk doen toenemen op het toekomstige sint annaknooppunt bij de oosterweelverbinding wij zijn tegenstander van dit voorstel dit is het unanieme standpunt van alfaport onze contacten met de logistieke en de transportsector leren dat men daar hetzelfde denkt
7995750 nog terzijde een vierde van de havenarbeiders en een derde van de logistieke arbeiders in de haven worden door het waasland geleverd
7995751 we pleiten dus onomwonden voor het historisch trac e17 liefkenshoek alleen die verbinding die tien jaar geleden geraamd werd op 62 5 miljoen euro
7995752 nielsen has already issued its first report for ideacasts health club network sources confirmed other networks have also signed up for the service among them gas station tv arena media networks and cbs outernet
7995753 standardized metrics could be a game changer for a medium advertisers find attractive but that lacks the metrics to give it a fair evaluation
7995754 nielsen has a database of 30 000 planners and buyers and theyre sending this to their entire database
7995755 our business plan and internal projections are based on these reports its now our currency
7995756 perhaps the most important aspect of the new pocketpieces will be nielsens imprimatur a stamp of approval that would provide legitimacy and authenticity for place based networks calling on advertisers and agencies
7995757 the ability to flow place based tv audience estimates into media planning software from firms such as nielsens ims unit or various media and marketing mix modeling systems
7995758 whereas television and internet audience estimates are taken from consumer panels nielsen will gather data for the out of home video networks primarily from compiling and modeling third party data and combining that with nielsen research conducted by telephone
7995759 while nielsen is the first research firm to try to establish currency for the medium it may not go unchallenged
7995760 there are a lot of companies out there looking to measure ooh video two companies may also work together
7995761 our guidelines are a rule book for any research provider to use
7995762 while out of home video advertising was estimated by pq media to take in 1 28 billion in spending in 2007 the emerging media sector did so with no standardized metrics for advertisers and agencies to buy it efficiently the 18 month old out of home video advertising bureau is working with more than two dozen vendor and measurement partners including nielsen arbitron screenvision and cbs outernet to help create a universal measurement checklist for out of home media buyers but even after the metrics receive official approval from the american association of advertisers and agencies theyre not likely to be employed until early 2009
7995763 all i want to know is who is watching my ads i still cannot get a straight answer
7995764 it took tv 50 years to come up with c3 average commercial minute ratings as opposed to program ratings nu it took outdoor 100 years to come up with eyes on a method of determining how many passers by actually looked at the billboards as opposed to just passing traffic numbers nu and it took us 18 months to achieve better results with our audience metrics guidelines
7995765 nearly five years in development the eyes on ratings will replace the decades old practice of relying solely on traffic counts to put a value on outdoor ads
7995766 its a dramatic improvement in outdoor measurement quite frankly it puts us in a position of having a better measurement system than any other medium
7995767 we continue to talk to interested parties about our service which offers superior results
7995768 we think its the best answer for the u s
7995769 a lot of agencies use optimizers and theyve never been able to plug in out of home
7995770 for a lot of clients weve had to sell outdoor into the plan as a test the new ratings could open up new categories and new advertisers to outdoor
7995771 packaged goods have always wanted more validation and more measurement because theyre used to national broadcast
7995772 we can promote ourselves as a national medium particularly when you can compare cpms across markets
7995773 starcom usa will no longer do business with unrated networks that are not measured by companies or rating services that can offer documented data on viewership
7995774 in prior years standard industry practice has been to negotiate tv buys from unrated networks based on estimates from those networks and disparate sources
7995775 the availability of second by second data from companies such as tns in its alignment with charter and directv allow for national performance metrics for these previously unrated networks and reveal never before seen insights into behaviors of those networks audiences
7995776 i dont know which half of my ad budget works
7995777 will be among the fastest growing ad supported media over the next few years and will begin to rival traditional outdoor advertising by 2012
7995778 while video ad networks remains the largest alternative ooh category digital billboards and displays grew the fastest in 2007 due to the strong rollout of new at road signs primarily from lamar and clear channel spending on digital billboards increased 59 7 percent in 2007 to 372 0 million
7995779 likens the digital out of home ad marketplace to the explosive growth of the early internets but cautions that the growth will not come without challenges including the impact of a general economic downturn that is expected to last through next year despite the positive outlook the digital out of home business faces challenges
7995780 in the short term the sector is untested in an economic slowdown although it was holding up well in the first half of 2008 second while major brands are pressuring their agencies to take a closer look at digital ooh agencies are demanding more and better measurement on the effectiveness of digital out of home advertising this will be key to the struggle of digital out of home
7995781 cutting edge measurement particularly engagement metrics such as new eye dwell technology has the potential to make digital out of home spending a prominent component of media plans in the future
7995782 improved metrics and accountability coupled with increasingly mobile consumer lifestyle patterns and a shift away from static video advertising meanwhile is expected to accelerate digital out of home advertisings share of the outdoor medium as well as the overall advertising marketplace
7995783 unmeasured disciplines primarily marketing services such as direct marketing promotion and digital communications including unmeasured forms of internet media such as paid search
7995784 the drive to digital is providing new ways to measure multimedia efforts and proving a catalyst thats bringing this movement to fruition
7995785 the numbers look great for google with paid search advertising expected to hover at around 40 of the total online ad spend through to 2012 increasing as a whole from 8 6 billion in 2007 to 16 59 billion in 2012 a 92 9 increase over 5 years

7995891 delegates tended to be the same folks year after year but this year its a lot different
7995892 in the end confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression
7995893 now i missed a few years of the cold war as a guest of one of our adversaries but as i recall the world was deeply divided during the cold war between the side of freedom and the side of tyranny
7995894 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
7995895 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
7995896 if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright
7995897 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias

7995918 dit is zo belangrijk als de minister het niet meer weet laat haar chef het dan maar beantwoorden ik wil nu weten hoe het zit wat was de persoonlijke betrokkenheid van de minister bij de acties van destijds en heeft ze nu wel of niet bewust de bekentenis ondertekend dat ze het zich niet meer kan herinneren vind ik een vreemd verhaal

7995922 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi sono rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso

7995924 not so much not right now if someone asks me that again i might get nervous like why should i be
7995925 im really having a great time at the games of the 29 beijing
7995926 everything has just been fantastic from the wonderful performance of michael phelps to the graciousness of the chinese the games of the 29 th olympiad have really been something to behold
7995927 she always says the whole name its really pretty ridiculous the other day i overheard her telling someone that the city of london really has its work cut out for it in terms of the games of the 30 th olympiad since the games of the 29 th olympiad here in beijing have been so stellar soooo annoying
7995928 we did not raise the kind of high falootin pompous ninny that everyone has seen ann become were just normal americans we call it the olympics like any reasonable person
7995929 its just very upsetting to know that despite your best efforts to raise your kids in a grounded environment embracing core american values your daughter might someday sully your family name by using the phrase games of the 29 th olympiad ad nauseam in front of the whole damn country
7995930 must i paint you a picture about the way that i feel this situation of art vs life and the present elitism within the bourgeoisie and upper class the critics hold their heads high cause they know about the real suffering and the real work while we get the easy accessible forms of communication and entertainment pinned down simple for us to comprehend the lack of stimulants within art politics and life lowers our standards which is why we settle for talkshows and mtv we are not stupid but if we are treated like ingrates we will start to act like children the lack of challenging forms of expression and thoughts of fire and self confidence gives us a passive and hollow nature so reclaim art take back the fine culture for the people the working people the living people and burn down their art galleries and destroy their fancy constructions and buildings cause we unlike the bourgeoisie have nothing to lose and therefore our expression will be the only honest one our words will be the only challenging ones and our art will be the one revolutionary expression we need new noise and new voices and new canvases to become something more than the last poets of a useless generation
7995931 im not well versed enough in hardcore to distinguish what sets this album apart from so many other punk contenders but i enjoy the turn on a dime tempo shifts and arty textures which in combination holds the constant promise of something breathtaking

7995933 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7995934 how much of the ball in play stats account for kicking stats time in air etc
7995935 the ball in play statistics are misleading because they involve kicking stats time in air etc so it isnt actually the amount of time that the ball is being run back and forth
7995936 i try to buy businesses that are so good an idiot could run them because someday one will
7995937 human beings cannot survive unless they create a provision for the future

7995941 whether or not there will be a roll call and if so under what conditions is entirely up to the obama campaign and they have not yet decided what the roll call is going to look like
7995942 if actually deployed will leave our country more vulnerable than the existing yet flawed system in operation today
7995943 severe technical troubles poor contractor management and weak government oversight

7995949 this is a significant step for me to get back out on the practice field
7995950 if things go well as we expect they will then i hope to be full go next week and ready for the season opener
7995951 were going to monitor him and rookie tight end tom santi who will start practicing today
7995952 so we do have a pitch count on those guys
7995953 i think its somewhat irrelevant because of where we are today and i kind of like to keep you guys guessing
7995954 i never really like talking too much about an injury because if you play well they say man look how tough he is
7995955 i hope to be ready and i certainly dont want to create this dramatic announcement i think i will do some parts of practice today and tomorrow and i may even dress for thursdays game though i wont play well do a short practice monday and then hopefully ill be full go wednesday
7995956 hes been doing it forever hes been doing it since he was 6 years old in his backyard
7995957 he and marvin harrison have been together forever and this is my eighth year so you kind of get used to it
7995958 we really dont know at this point where it is
7995959 it could be anywhere from a couple of weeks to a major injury we dont know that yet jeff has some options but we dont know how bad it is and it could be through this weekend before we know for sure
7995960 ive always been confident hell be ready for the opener
7995961 well start to see how that goes one thing is we dont want to put him out there if hes not physically or mentally ready
7995962 pizza is one of the most widely eaten dishes in the world and it should never cost more than 3 50 5 99
7995963 we launched this initiative because pizza has become more and more expensive vis a vis the general surge in food prices and we want to help consumers and their families make ends meet each month
7995964 pizza is a poor mans dish and a passing fancy for the rich
7995965 i sent my mum a text phone message i love you and i am going down
7995966 i called her half an hour later and she couldnt believe i was ok
7995967 experienced an in flight depressurisation incident which caused the oxygen masks on board to deploy
7995968 as a safety precaution the captain descended and diverted the aircraft to limoges airport
7995969 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
7995970 i would say some people thought we were going to die
7995971 for about half an hour no one told us anything we didnt know what was happening at all we were quite panicky
7995972 after half an hour we were told to take the oxygen mask off and then the plane landed and we were fine
7995973 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
7995974 they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
7995975 as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8000 feet where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off that they were diverting to limoges
7995976 the irish and french aviation authorities have been notified of this incident and a full investigation of this incident will be undertaken later today
7995977 i think its no secret and ive said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process
7995978 what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7995979 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together over this period of time
7995980 so we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we know what is in israel and what is in palestine that is ultimately the goal
7995981 initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7995982 which still continue and which without a doubt are the main obstacle in the political process
7995983 just because we have not yet succeeded does not mean we have failed
7995984 the coming weeks will be decisive for the peace process we are at a crossroads and the efforts and the meetings will continue in order to build on the ideas presented for the first time today
7995985 will continue efforts to reach a historic agreement by the end of the bush administration
7995986 i would like to suggest to my partners not to use it as an excuse and i know they are not using it as an excuse but i understand their frustration sometimes
7995987 there were some small activities but they will not influence the ability to negotiate nor the future borders of the palestinian state
7995988 the winners tools urge not much bare the engenderers installation
7995989 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7995990 for you created my inmost being you knit me together in my mothers womb i praise you because i am fearfully and wonderfully made your works are wonderful i know that full well my frame was not hidden from you when i was made in the secret place when i was woven together in the depths of the earth you eyes saw my unformed body all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be how precious to me are your thoughts o god how vast is the sum of them
7995991 and god is able to make all grace abound to you so that in all things at all times having all that you need you will abound in every good work
7995992 the marks on the ground tell us that the plane hit the ground tail first and as a result the tail cone the end part of the plane broke off
7995993 i guess i did realize that when the plane was going to take off perhaps it was not going so fast
7995994 and i said to myself something is going on here
7995995 i grabbed the seat i noticed a bump my stomach was rising and falling
7995996 there were children who had seats on top of them what i did was pull them out and set them aside so they were not trapped
7995997 i know a lot is being made of this but i think any human being at any time when people ask for help will give it
7995998 it is a contradictory feeling because i know that bodies are arriving back there and i will arrive intact
7995999 all of the things that are going on in the economy arent just by happen stance
7996000 they are a direct result of policies that george bush and john mccain have put in place and now there answer is lets keep on doing the same thing
7996001 one thing i have said several times when i have been with obama is that he really showed a lot of composure against the karl rove style unrelenting attacks

7996018 funding arrangements for schools that are riddled with anomalies and flaws
7996019 the only way out in the longer term is for a root and branch review of the arrangements involving all funding partners
7996020 1 5 billion for government schools would be required merely to reclaim the sector shares in place at the outset of the howard years
7996021 if continued they will result in a cut in real terms for the school system that educates the majority of australian children

7996099 gustav continues to represent a potential threat to oil and gas installations in the gulf region and will be watched with vigilance
7996100 given the current track for gustav and the expectation that it might enter the gulf of mexico this weekend we are making logistical arrangements to evacuate staff who are not essential to production or drilling operations
7996101 evacuations could begin as early as tomorrow there is no impact on production at this time

7996107 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7996108 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7996109 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7996110 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7996111 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7996112 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7996113 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7996114 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7996115 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7996116 lady birds legacy sowing the future one seed at a time
7996117 we are pleased to launch this campaign and call on our readers to join us in honoring lady bird and the amazing work she did throughout her life to bring beauty and color to our roadways and parks
7996118 she led the way showing us why preserving and beautifying our environment matters
7996119 it is hard for the department to spend funds on things other than maintaining the roadways we have today so we look at all of our functions and try to save wherever we can we save every penny we can and put it back into maintaining our pavement
7996120 texas wildflowers are beautiful but thats only part of the story
7996121 they are climate adapted saving on scarce water and other resources and they provide habitats for birds butterflies and other wildlife
7996122 frankly planting wildflowers and native plants is one of the easiest and most rewarding things we can do to benefit the environment
7996123 coming together to celebrate the natural world and to secure it for tomorrow and future generations and do it in memory of lady bird johnson

7996162 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7996163 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7996164 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7996165 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7996166 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7996167 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7996168 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7996169 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7996170 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7996171 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7996172 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7996173 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7996174 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7996175 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7996176 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7996177 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7996178 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7996179 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7996180 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7996181 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7996182 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7996183 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7996184 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7996185 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7996186 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7996187 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7996188 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7996189 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7996190 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7996191 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7996192 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7996193 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7996194 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7996195 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7996196 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7996197 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7996198 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7996199 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7996200 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7996201 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7996202 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7996203 yo get her outta here big said they led kim out of the room and she screamed and cursed the whole way it was absolutely crazy in that house kim was naked and being led somewhere to get dressed i was still screaming on big damion cease and gutter were laughing in amazement that i would be so bold and big looked like he was just too through with all of us he sat up in bed shaking his head kim left the house and i stayed talking to big about why he couldnt be honest with me about her i thought it was all about tiffany

7996209 so if you are presenting a sacrifice at the altar in the temple and you suddenly remember that someone has something against you leave your sacrifice there at the altar go and be reconciled to that person then come and offer your sacrifice to god
7996210 its their fault they should be making changes why should i appologise
7996211 its not important who most needs to change but rather who is most willing to take the steps towards making a change within that willingness peace will come

7996223 the us dollar weakened significantly against other major currencies in 2007 and according to some economists is expected to depreciate further in 2008
7996224 as a consequence other currencies particularly the euro are poised to weaken the us dollars dominance as the currency of choice for international remittances and payments
7996225 this trend could also drive an increase in observed instances of bulk cash transfers denominated in currencies other than canadian and us dollars

7996294 i was unhappy and upset that she lost but im going to be voting for obama in november

7996340 the message is clear we have made a demand for change for freedom and for justice
7996341 the people do not want to be exploited we want an economic order that protects all the people
7996342 yes of course we have lost we were the underdogs going into this race

7996347 the main thing we did was talk about the true freshman whether it be a walk on or scholarship guy and whether or not hell get in the game
7996348 i know youre going to ask who will but im not going to answer that question right now except to say that a large number of true freshmen should play i would say 8 12 would probably play true freshmen
7996349 youre pumped its almost like your first day of high school first day of college

7996351 there was a spell there where he was getting some reps but thats kind of fallen by the wayside
7996352 thats not to say we couldnt revive the idea one day
7996353 the idea of knowshon in the open field with the kind of blocking weve gotten lately would be an exciting thing to see
7996354 so we might get him some work there before the year is over i know hed be excited about the opportunity we might trot him out there it would be exciting to see what would happen
7996355 i know that was based on what we did last year but no two teams are ever the same and thats certainly the case for us this year
7996356 thirty of our 44 on the two deep who have never suited up in a college game and were going out to play the no 1 team in front of a sellout crowd

7996358 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7996359 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7996360 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7996361 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7996362 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7996363 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7996364 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7996365 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7996366 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7996367 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7996368 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7996369 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7996370 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

7996423 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7996424 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7996425 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry

7996459 its important to test any scientific tool because all have limits some situations are more suited than others for barcode use
7996460 this research could help clarify the answer to that question
7996461 to have that kind of data is hugely valuable and the list of applications is endless and spans all of biology
7996462 but it all hinges on building an accurate database our study is a cautionary tale if were going to do it lets do it right
7996463 building a genetic library of all life is a great goal
7996464 but we need to pay careful attention to the data that go into that library to make sure they are accurate
7996465 scientists have been so preoccupied with creating a barcode of life that they have not been careful in monitoring the accuracy of the underlying data

7996491 if we were playing golf id win if we had a drinking contest id win football basketball mixed martial arts nintendo you name it id beat him why because i am the gold standard period
7996492 anything i set my mind to do i do it michael phelps set his mind to swimming and he beat everybody everybody but me as the true gold standard my chances are astronomical its almost a foregone conclusion that without a shadow of doubt the gold standard will hit paydirt i will go on to unforgiven after winning the championship scramble qualifier and i will become the wwe champion that is guaranteed there aint no stopping me now or ever

7996738 declined to say if scheunemann had ever lobbied mccain on gun control bills
7996739 he has weighed in with advice on second amendment and firearms issues
7996740 scheunemann spent most of his time at the event backstage where mccain had a brief meeting with nra leaders
7996741 refused to answer questions about whether the senator supports or opposes the white house plan to close the loophole
7996742 the moral of the story before you give a false name to the police know if the law is looking for them
7996743 our conditions were uncomfortable but because were westerners we suffered absolutely nothing compared to what the tibetan people suffer
7996744 the protesters participated in tibet independence activities and that is against chinas law
7996745 the relevant countries will teach their citizens to abide and respect chinas laws
7996746 they asked about our actions our roles about our lives everything from where i went to high school to everything i ate in china
7996747 it was the scariest it was beyond anything i could imagine in a movie
7996748 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7996749 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognise these separatist regions
7996750 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7996751 the united states will continue to stand with the people of georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity
7996752 the g7 is united in support for georgias territorial integrity and alarmed by reports of russian plans to recognise abkhazia and south ossetia
7996753 that decision is not going to help things it only adds to the tension in the region
7996754 we will take any decision including up to a complete break in relations
7996755 there has been a dramatic worsening of our relations but we are not to blame
7996756 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7996757 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7996758 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7996759 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7996760 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event
7996761 we had a concern that this was going to happen
7996762 we are neither registered nor do we have any bank accounts
7996763 we hope that sharif will not cause us any pain nor that we will cause any pain to him

7996768 our governor is out of town up in denver for some big party theyre throwing there

7996770 i sent my mum a text message i love you and i am going down
7996771 i called her half an hour later and she couldnt believe i was ok
7996772 experienced an in flight depressurisation incident which caused the oxygen masks on board to deploy
7996773 as a safety precaution the captain descended and diverted the aircraft to limoges airport
7996774 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
7996775 i would say some people thought we were going to die
7996776 for about half an hour no one told us anything we didnt know what was happening at all we were quite panicky
7996777 after half an hour we were told to take the oxygen mask off and then the plane landed and we were fine
7996778 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
7996779 they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
7996780 as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8 000 feet where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off that they were diverting to limoges
7996781 the irish and french aviation authorities have been notified of this incident and a full investigation of this incident will be undertaken later today
7996782 nobody in the world believes that there is any possibility of an acquittal
7996783 but the driver hit the gas and i mean he hit the gas in the next instant i was on the ground clutching my knee in pain
7996784 direct affront to the will of the people of zimbabwe
7996785 landmark agreements have been concluded with every expectation that everybody will sign up
7996786 the elections are now behind us now is the time for us to put zimbabwe first
7996787 food is their latest weapon in their regime change agenda
7996788 to a praiseworthy search for peace and greater amity for our nation
7996789 happily all political parties in the country have acknowledged culpability in this violence
7996790 for the avoidance of doubt the only person who can officially open parliament will be determined by the outcome of the ongoing dialogue
7996791 we will not attend we dont expect any member of the executive to address us until that dialogue has been concluded
7996792 i saw burned bodies wounded people and small pools of blood
7996793 today i was so happy to get a job at last to feed my wife and two kids
7996794 i used to work as day labourer in construction but theres no construction in the area and its hard to find work
7996795 we will beat terrorism and al qaeda we will not abandon our work
7996796 if we do so we will abandon our honour as well because al qaeda would take full control over our area
7996797 i thank god who has been with me through this gruelling election process i thank the voters
7996798 the message is clear we have made a demand for change for freedom and for justice
7996799 the people do not want to be exploited we want an economic order that protects all the people
7996800 yes of course we have lost we were the underdogs going into this race
7996801 this is a clear indication that people of all races have rejected the communal politics of barisan nasional it is a clear endorsement of our reform agenda we are on track to take over the government
7996802 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7996803 tonight when hillary clinton speaks she will be an articulate voice for the working men and women the middle class families that have been squeezed and she will make the case as she uniquely can for why barack obama is the right choice for the presidency
7996804 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7996805 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7996806 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7996807 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7996808 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7996809 if they want relations to worsen they will get it
7996810 in this situation the ball is in the europeans court
7996811 if they want relations to worsen they will get it
7996812 but if they want to save a strategic relationship which is absolutely in the interest of both russia and europe everything will be fine
7996813 this is contrary to the principles of the independence the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia
7996814 examine from this point of view the consequences of russia s decision
7996815 i hope that our european partners will understand how to separate the wheat from the chaff and that we will be able to build normal and fruitful future relations
7996816 i think that georgia should be a normal state completely separate as regards its sovereignty it is of course a complex question one that will ultimately be determined by its relations with its neighbours
7996817 georgia must learn lessons from what has happened its a serious lesson one about how to construct relations with your close neighbours and with people who once were part of georgia
7996818 russian troops are only found in the buffer zone covered under the sarkozys six point plan interpretation of which has varied significantly between moscow and the west
7996819 the number of people without health insurance coverage decreased to 45 7 million people in 2007
7996820 generally what the report shows is that there has been some change but its pretty minor
7996821 this isnt progress the changes are insignificant and we would need to see this happen for 10 years to say there has been progress
7996822 you have to remember that the numbers in the report are from last year this year americans have been faced with record high petrol prices and rising food prices unemployment is also up meaning fewer americans have access to employer health benefits
7996823 in 2006 the number of poor elderly people would be higher by 12 6 million people if social security payments were excluded from money income more than quadrupling the number of poor elderly
7996824 for the love of christ guess what i found today when i opened the door
7996825 demos political con hype spin amp bunkum for the masses
7996826 everyday people sort of guy sen john mccain made an appearance on jay lenos
7996827 you can make it if you try the sly and the family stone lyrics for the tune they played on mccains entrance
7996828 i i i i i am everyday people yeah yeah
7996829 thank you for mentioning that said mccain who will turn 72 on friday and is likely to roll out the name of his presidential running mate that day to take some of the steam out of barack obamas convention closer on thursday
7996830 wouldnt it be good to have a person you dont know what party theyre with they have no political principles whatsoever they may need a job about that time said mccain pointedly suggesting that his pick could be the soon to be free agent seated next to him
7996831 the approval rating for congress is now down to nine percent thats blood relatives and paid staffers mccain said reeling out a standard one liner
7996832 ive explored all the perfectly rational reasons people dont like annuities and ive concluded theres something more fundamental

7996844 there is no limit to what can be accomplished if it doesnt matter who gets the credit
7996845 the conventional wisdom is that foreign economies depend on americans to buy their exports
7996846 there is no limit to what can be accomplished if it doesnt matter who gets the credit
7996847 china has used the pretext of reserve requirement hikes to help slow yuan appreciation we estimate that the pboc central bank intervened by about 49 6bn in june

7996869 bruce was nonpolitical until the george bush era forced us all to re think what kind of country we have become
7996870 not much of a bon jovi fan but bruce springsteen has been the most important artistic voice in america over the past 30 years particularly when it comes to examining in song the meaning of this country having him perform at the obama nomination acceptance is a real coup and lends some real prestige to the proceedings
7996871 jon bon jovi wont be playing a show before presumptive barack obama accepts his partys nomination thursday at invesco field
7996872 he felt like he had a layer of security but he probably never counted on a turtle with a tracking device leading us to that location and finding the field
7996873 vigorous expression of the freedoms that make our society great
7996874 and each generation needs to explore the history of the past to understand fully the context in which these polar extremes come into clashes with one another so history of how we dealt with these problems in the 1940s and 1950s is a current history and a history that is very important for us to understand
7996875 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
7996876 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
7996877 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
7996878 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
7996879 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7996880 all you need is 200 people in the crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this

7997069 the first wave of online video was a total failure for brand advertisers
7997070 in order to attract the billions of dollars of brand advertising spending that is still dedicated to television programming online companies will have to provide audience and frequency at a scale to compete with traditional broadcast and build it around brand safe content that is relevant and entertaining mevio is building that network
7997071 from distribution and licensing to format and delivery to basic underlying business models the entertainment industry is continuing to undergo a dramatic shift as the web evolves
7997072 mevios rapid growth both in audience and programming is testament to its focus on delivering a vision for entertainment that cannot be found elsewhere on the web we look forward to helping mevio continue to execute on this vision
7997073 we have always focused on high quality episodic content and have always questioned the relevance of single clip video upload models for brands
7997074 mevio is building a full scale entertainment network that incorporates all of the positive elements of traditional media along with the benefits of scale and insight offered by the internet

7997077 the denver school budget has been cut by more than 50 million just to provide the funds to the denver police this atmosphere has been created to justify that budget

7997083 were way way behind in our infrastructure investment both in the private sector and publicly

7997089 nbc did not mention mitchams orientation nor did they show his family and partner who were in the stands nbc has made athletes significant others a part of the coverage in the past choosing to spotlight track athlete sanya richards fiancee a love triangle between french and italian swimmers and kerri walshs wedding ring debacle
7997090 its not part of the story hes just an athlete
7997091 not only did he quit diving but he battled depression and then took a big step coming out in an interview
7997092 matthew mitcham did two surprising things in beijing he scooped a gold medal from the apparently invincible chinese diving team and told anyone who asked that he is gay
7997093 from teenage retirement to royal easter show high diver to gay icon to gold olympic medallist matthew mitchams journey to success has been an amazing roller coaster
7997094 it seems the editors referring to mitchams advocate cover article just look at louganis as a
7997095 being gay and diving are completely separate parts of my life of course theres going to be crossover because some people have issues
7997096 but everyone i dive with has been so supportive im happy with myself and where i am im very happy with who i am and what ive done
7997097 they focus on us athletes yep lots of discussion on that point and their families
7997098 i hope you can prove me wrong but please give me some examples of non american families being highlighted on nbc primetime
7997099 name me one prime time saturday night personal factoid of an athlete who lived in the southern hemisphere and was born prior to 1988
7997100 i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president without knowing necessarily what hes doing
7997101 my vice president also will be a member of the executive branch
7997102 he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law
7997103 it is a comprehensive security program to protect the lower manhattan area indeed all of manhattan from vehicle born explosive devices
7997104 this is more like being under communist reign instead of being in a free country and being able to choose where you want to go when you want to go and not be monitored at all times
7997105 i mean if you dont have anything to worry about you wont worry
7997106 now if youre trying to hide something and they scan your license plate you have a problem then theres good reason
7997107 that was the law before the initiative and its nothing new i dont know why wed relax any law
7997108 the people of denver have made it clear they do not want adults in this city punished for simply possessing a drug less harmful than alcohol
7997109 tomorrow we will deliver an official memo from the panel to the chief of police and the mayor and we expect police to abide by this very logical recommendation
7997110 if police expect the taxpayers to cover their 1 2 million in overtime during the dnc
7997111 it is only fair that they respect the laws adopted by those taxpayers there will be plenty for police to do during the dnc aside from arresting or citing adults who are simply making the safer choice to use marijuana instead of alcohol
7997112 the implication here is that a lot of pot smokers are coming to town
7997113 and this is also news to all the republicans going to their convention in st paul dont take your pot dont take your pot to the dnc
7997114 thats something you might want to forward that to peter doocy
7997115 apparently in denver they have made it a low priority to make arrests for people who are smoking pot caught with pot whatever
7997116 so whats the concern now they think that because all the security is coming to the city theres gonna be more arrests for people who are smoking pot
7997117 the denver police want you to know that if you bring your mary jane you could end up in the hooscow
7997118 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7997119 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7997120 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7997121 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7997122 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank
7997123 this congress has been one of the most unproductive on record theyve failed to address the challenge of high gas prices
7997124 they need to send me a bill next month that i can sign so we can bring relief to drivers small business owners farmers and ranchers and every american affected by high prices at the pump
7997125 m ost people would be upset to know that police were spying on lawful citizens and infiltrating peaceful organizations rather than chasing down real criminals
7997126 at a minimum such police spying is clearly a waste of taxpayer dollars and a diversion from the mission of protecting and serving the people
7997127 i want the subcommittee to determine how widespread these activities are and who ordered them
7997128 brought to at least 95 the number of sporting related events he has participated in during his time in the white house he has done no fewer than 18 such events so far this year already passing his previous record of 13 in both 2001 and 2007

7997131 i was a little taken aback because i was a lot younger than he was
7997132 my husband had been separated you know six and a half years it was a long separation
7997133 his own divorce filing shows they dated for nine months while he was still living with carol and records show he applied for a marriage license in arizona before his divorce was final
7997134 the chronology that is presented publicly doesnt necessarily match the chronology of the documents

7997136 i no longer work for fox news i did for about a year

7997138 harold will not applaud this but in 2010 were going to have some democrats we mean business to in some primaries
7997139 the amount of concern and urgency from the detroit companies has increased in the last month and significantly ratcheted up what theyre communicating what their funding needs are
7997140 i believe we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
7997141 its a commonsense response to the realities on the ground
7997142 we dont see it as a bailout we see it as government assistance to help retooling tied to the production of these advanced technology vehicles
7997143 government policy can be aligned with consumer demand and the efforts of the industry
7997144 i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
7997145 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
7997146 he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
7997147 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
7997148 according to recent allegations in your capacity as the former cia deputy director of clandestine operations and chief of the near east division you were tasked by former cia director george tenet to create the false letter and may even have seen the white house stationery on which the false letter assignment was reportedly written
7997149 given your reported direct knowledge of these events i am requesting that you contact judiciary committee staff as soon as possible to set up a time to discuss your involvement and knowledge of the allegedly false letter

7997151 a new report says election officials often are outsourcing their responsibilities to the very companies that make the e voting machines even trusting those companies to count the votes
7997152 elections should be accountable to the people and run by public officials who are selected by the people when thats handed over to private vendors these public elections are no longer public
7997153 the depth of the current dependence is shocking but even more shocking is the fact that our elections are dependent on vendors whose records reveal their unethical and even unlawful behavior as well as their incompetence

7997314 for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that jesus christ is come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist
7997315 every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world

7997336 the downside is that 9 times out of 10 its completely useless because its almost impossible to read or its a really bizarre picture of a naked lady thats not clickable

7997431 hes a good football player and he brings that energy that you want to the football team
7997432 hester he reminds me a little bit of michael turner just for his power being able to run through people
7997433 before i even met him i said hes a football player
7997434 thats the kind of guy you want on your side
7997435 thats what i think of myself just a football player

7997460 the colossal species has a reputation for being an aggressive and dangerous predator and have been feared and misrepresented in the past
7997461 my research suggests theyre not the t rex of the sea they get more docile as they mature a strange phenomenon that has caught scientists off guard
7997462 we are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre as she got older she got shorter and broader and was reduced to a giant gelatinous blob carrying many thousands of eggs
7997463 her shape was likely to have affected her behavior and ability to hunt i cant imagine her jetting herself around in the water at any great speed and she was too gelatinous to have been a fighting machine
7997464 its likely she was just blobbing around the seabed carrying her brood of eggs living on dead fish while her mate was off hunting
7997465 in matters of style swim with the current in matters of principle stand like a rock
7997466 i am fairly young single no kids and no extended family in the large city where i live i rent because i could never afford to buy here and ill leave in the next couple of years because of it
7997467 i am concerned with exactly two items of local news when is the dog park in my neighborhood opening and are there any train delays this morning
7997468 it pains me to say that because i was a newspaper reporter for nearly a decade and i like nothing more than to settle in for a good read with a bagel and juice in the morning but pages upon pages of city council minutiae and youth baseball coverage say nothing to me except goodbye everything i read about how to save newspapers includes the idea of hyper local but i cant think of a better way to turn me off
7997469 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7997470 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7997471 jury duty is a 2 day minimum the average length that our citizens spend with us is about 2 25 days and the average trial is about 1 5 weeks
7997472 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7997473 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7997474 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way

7997476 the idea had kind of been floating around because people had noticed these bats with no injuries
7997477 when people were first starting to talk about the issue it was bats running into the turbine blades we always said no
7997478 i can pick up nine different species of bird i can pick up two species of bat

7997480 we want to save a species at risk without putting humanity at risk
7997481 its a critical time for the vaquita and the mexican government has stepped up to the plate
7997482 the flora and fauna around us are shifting over time due to climate change
7997483 the result is desynchronization if birds and the insects upon which they depend do not react in the same way we are headed for an upheaval in the interaction between species
7997484 i was surprised by both the number and the potential toxicity of the chemicals that were found
7997485 nearly 100 volatile organic compounds were emitted from these six products and none were listed on any product label plus five of the six products emitted one or more carcinogenic hazardous air pollutants which are considered by the environmental protection agency to have no safe exposure level
7997486 balloons were dropping and kerry family members and delegates were happily batting them around but not as many as scheduled
7997487 we really liked how these folks tried so hard to have a nice house and garden even though you can tell they dont have money
7997488 were concerned that theres no trash cans or parks for these families

7997495 the problem for the bush admin is that they perfected plausible deniability techniques
7997496 they bring out one or two people that are willing to debate on cable shows whether waterboarding is torture and it leaves the impression that its a closed question
7997497 its not its just like the domestic surveillance program that the federal court said just a week ago was also not just a closed question

7997504 in previous studies using brain imaging we found the subcallosal cingulate region was a key region in an emerging emotion regulation circuit implicated in major depression
7997505 we postulated that if stimulation worked for the treatment of other neurological disorders where abnormal function of specific circuits was well established such as parkinsons disease then stimulation of the cg25 region within this apparent depression circuit might provide significant benefit for patients with treatment resistant depression
7997506 in an open label study such as the one being published this month there is always potential for the device to work because patients believe it will
7997507 in the next study which has already begun all patients will have the device implanted but one third will not have it turned on during the first year of the study so that after meals it wont be blocking the nerve signals this is called sham treatment
7997508 after the pivotal study is completed those who had the sham treatment will have their devices turned on so they can experience the benefits
7997509 and unlike the first study participants also will have access to behavioral counseling and dietary modifications which will lead to a more realistic comparison of the magnitude of weight loss through vagal blockade as compared with bariatric surgery the findings published this month are promising but the next study will tell us whether vbloc therapy is a viable alternative to gastric bypass or gastric banding and for which patients

7997511 at home soaks or scrubs would just exfoliate not remove corns
7997512 skin cancer on the legs and feet actually has a high mortality rate due to people forgetting to do skin checks on that area its often caught too late
7997513 this is due in large part to the fact that many people simply forget to apply or reapply sunscreen to the lower extremities
7997514 no matter race or ethnicity the legs and feet are not immune to the suns effects and women have an even greater chance of developing skin cancer than men because they often have more of their leg exposed
7997515 the best protection is to continually apply sunscreen with an spf of at least 15 with both uvb and uva protection every few hours and more often if youre going to be at the beach running in and out of the water
7997516 unfortunately this is not the case with all nail salons
7997517 as a result the instruments can spread germs that can cause nail fungus and bacterial infections
7997518 its a common myth perpetuated by both physicians and patients alike that vinegar is a cure all
7997519 but vinegar cant penetrate the layers of the nail to get to the infection site and without proper treatment the infection can spread to other nails
7997520 if one person in the household has it everyone should be cautious and take proper precautions
7997521 if you have a plantar wart dont pick or perform bathroom surgery on it
7997522 dont put duct tape on it and expect it to go away since there is a specific protocol for using it see your dermatologist or podiatrist for this and other treatment options

7997537 due to the unprecedented demand for american eagle gold one ounce bullion coins our inventories have been depleted we are therefore temporarily suspending all sales of these coins
7997538 we are working diligently to build up our inventory and hope to resume sales shortly
7997539 until the u s mint can supply us with more coins we wont be able to supply any to our customers
7997540 nobody has the eagles or the buffaloes right now we bought 2 000 ounces late last week and those were the last 2 000 ounces that we can find in the marketplace
7997541 this kind of spike in demand is something no one can foresee and no business runs itself waiting for this to happen
7997542 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to bring to the table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7997543 it was pretty evident that the only thing that was supporting these loans was higher home prices
7997544 i dont recall anything this bad happening before in this country since the great depression in those days they didnt have the fdic so everyone lost their shirts so i guess the fdic is supposed to be the savior the failing of the savings and loans in the 80s still wasnt this traumatic and amounted to some folks committing some crimes though some crimes have been committed here those folks will be brought to justice one way or another but the fact is our banking system just fell prey to good old american greed bankers thought they could ride the wave a little bit longer by getting the largest number of loans written possible now the markets will have a correction the companies who can survive their mistakes will survive those who cant survive will get bought out and will learn their lesson its really that simple
7997545 i would rather have had one breath of her hair one kiss from her mouth one touch of her hand than eternity without it
7997546 gaudfroy began studying chinese in 1998 while still in france creating within his paris
7997547 i didnt have much else to do so i would spend all day long studying chinese in any possible way
7997548 another one is the fact that most adults want to understand evrything before they learn if we can fight that tendency and adopt a childrens attitude our understanding ability is greater than children and we can at least compensate for that brain cells deficiency if not learn faster than children
7997549 language is mostly imitation id say at the beginning imitating perfectly takes 90 listening and 10 practice radio is the best way on this matter and tv to a lesser extent but tv is fantastic because with the image you can guess the meaning of everything avoiding any translation is the only way to really feel a language and think it naturally after one year of chinese i basically refused to use anything else than a 100 chinese dictionary its just a matter of time at the beginning youll be tired of not knowing the meaning of things but that will force you to develop hearing abilities and a great feeling for the language and youll think naturally in the language beacuse you have no choice
7997550 most of the time people who always ask why are bad learners because theres not much logic in the grammar or the way people speak in the mother language why is it this way because it is this way i was one of those why people but hard work made me realize i was wrong
7997551 remember always listen a lot more than you speak or practise and read and write a lot dont write by yourself in the first two years just copy anything you can all the time this way youll get used to not making mistakes
7997552 being gifted is more about being able to find out the best method and elimitate the useless ones in a short period of time when i see how somebody is studying i can tell how his chinese will be after two years
7997553 dont forget that i combined my method with 24 7 full attention for quite a few years so my two cents are you can do it are you ready to work that hard
7997554 i was never really taught how to act around a girl i thought teasing was the way to get them to notice me
7997555 earlier this year john mccain was interviewed on television and he promised that he would work against these shadowy outside groups that spread lies and pollute our country with their smears

7997582 of course there is only one ebor and that race can only ever be run at york but the totesport newburgh handicap the original norman name for newbury will give the owners and trainers another opportunity to win a valuable staying handicap over the same trip
7997583 ruth quinn has performed minor miracles in getting this done at such short notice
7997584 a lot of the sponsors have been fantastic and the owners and trainers she has spoken to have in the main been incredibly helpful out of the loss of a four day meeting like this there are some wonderful positives to racing in terms of what people can do in a crisis and this is a crisis

7997596 there were about 5 000 flight plans in the system but a lot of them were airborne and unaffected
7997597 the only flights that were affected were those that had already pushed off from the gates and couldnt get off the ground it created a backlog

7997634 al momento de la nacionalizaci n se excluy al estado de la distribuci n para asegurar la participaci n del sector privado en general aunque habr a algunas que eran propiedad estatal pasando todo el sistema a pertenecer al estado lo que se puede avisorar es un deterioro notable de la calidad sin que haya ning n beneficio esa es una actividad bastante marginal desde el punto de vista econ mico habida cuenta de las severas restricciones de los precios de los combustibles

7997642 desde hace mucho tiempo un grupo importante de analistas petroleros venezolanos hemos venido insistiendo en la necesidad de que los ciudadanos est n m s cerca de la propiedad del petr leo y de toda la actividad petrolera y que el estado no puede ser el nico actor una de las pocas actividades petroleras donde los ciudadanos ten an el derecho de participar que era la distribuci n y venta de la gasolina en el mercado interno ahora lo van a estatizar tambi n es volver a una situaci n que se le impuso al pa s hace varios a os cuando se nacionaliz el mercado interno

7997651 all of the things that are going on in the economy arent just by happen stance
7997652 they are a direct result of policies that george bush and john mccain have put in place and now there answer is lets keep on doing the same thing
7997653 one thing i have said several times when i have been with obama is that he really showed a lot of composure against the karl rove style unrelenting attacks
7997654 i thought the quality was high what i refer to as the way we practice our tempo and the energy that we had out here was far better than the first two years i think the less practices helped us in that i felt our football players were out here working to improve they werent out here trying to survive they were thriving individually and i think thats important and i think the schedule helped them on the negative side i thought it was disjointed i thought the scheduling part of it was a little disjointed the three six day weeks in a row but im pleased with the amount of work the quality amount of work we were able to get done

7997662 the author ghost writers and publishers of this book have agreed in court that the book contained a very large number 11 serious falsehoods which theyve admitted were complete lies
7997663 and the court has so ruled that these 11 statements were defamatory and untruthful
7997664 as far as im concerned thats the end of the matter
7997665 it was never my desire to seek any financial reward from this but simply to have it established that the truth is the truth and lies are lies im happy to have nailed that
7997666 many so called revelations about sir salmans home life his relationship with his wife son and interactions with police protection officers
7997667 in addition to the invasion of his privacy which this book represented of particular concern to the claimant were a series of utterly and demonstrably false statements which it contained
7997668 i hope that maybe this device of the declaration of falsity is another way of pursuing these matters
7997669 instead of going for the megabucks you simply go to court for the important thing which is to establish whats true and whats not
7997670 i think its a clearer and simpler way of dealing with this and im very pleased weve been able to use it in this way

7997722 it was just one principals decision and theres no state wide directive that cartwheels are banned in all queensland schools or anything like that

7997742 a campaign of intimidation and legal threats to convince television stations and the federal government to force off the air an ad by the american issues project detailing the link between sen obama and remorseless domestic terrorist william ayers
7997743 the scary question this raises is if barack obama demonstrates this little regard for free speech from his opponents during the campaign what could the american people expect from him as a president the tremendous amount of time money and effort the campaign is expending to run its own ads on the ayers controversy and dispatch its hired guns all over the country during the democratic convention speaks to the fear they must have that this issue is resonating with american voters

7997753 we cannot be diverted to the silliness that the mccain campaign of course they want to talk about paris hilton
7997754 would they want to talk about why they have the worst record of job creation in america of course they want to talk about something else they dont want to talk about the issues
7997755 when they talk about john mccains experience he has the experience of being wrong
7997756 what i like about it is its got a hidden agenda it looks as if its about listening and joining with allies except the idea here which mccain cant say but i can is to essentially kill the un to create an alternative to legitimize military actions

7997766 im not aware of any situation where a network says well have a look at an approved ad and then decide whether or not to run it
7997767 we do not believe that seven adheres to such a low standard of integrity and so request that you reverse the decision to refuse our request to purchase airtime around the closing ceremony of the olympics on sunday night for our tibet advertisement we have advertising space booked on every other network and would welcome the opportunity to communicate to our 280 000 members many of whom have expressed their outrage over the apparent censorship of this tvc that the seven network has agreed to broadcast it this time and therefore does indeed uphold the values that australians would expect and demand of their broadcasters
7997768 the world tuned to the beijing olympics and saw what he could do

7997774 the board also considered the advertisers claim that the billboard deals with a medical disorder but determined that the words used were not medical in nature and were a blatant message about a sexual act
7997775 the increased placements since february 2007 its size bold colours and blatant message were considered by the board as making the billboard confronting to a large section of the community

7997778 the ad is clearly tongue in cheek and a bit of fun
7997779 as im sure that you are aware there are guidelines that have been put in place for international media coming to beijing china in 2008 and there are politically sensitive topics that the government has asked the foreign media not to cover
7997780 if bmc was seen to be supporting an international programme whose intentions were to cover any of the 5 forbidden topics the repercussions for bmc and its clients could be disastrous for the olympic project and any further support for the remaining 26 years of the joint venture

7997791 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
7997792 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
7997793 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
7997794 i know has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and john mccain for president
7997795 looking at the interest in this election we think its highly probable

7997809 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7997810 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7997811 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7997812 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7997813 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7997814 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7997815 i am sick and tired of the president of the united states embarrassing me
7997816 dont pay attention to what mccain says because he doesnt speak officially for his own campaign

7997819 we have verified the antecedents of the woman and found that she was a hindu
7997820 if obama loses it will be a more honorable loss for liberals
7997821 if mccain is elected with 80 percent of the country convinced its on the wrong track then liberals and everybody else should give up politics
7997822 and as historically important as 2004 felt kerrys natural anti charisma depersonalized the election kerry was a compromise
7997823 there was a quiet sense of relief in his kerrys loss
7997824 if obama loses it will be a more honorable loss for liberals
7997825 i for one am quite proud of the party for taking the gamble yes it will hurt and hurt badly if he loses but therell be a tremendous payoff if he wins

7997841 they didnt draft him that high to sit on the bench
7997842 when he signed his contract when he came in two days late i grabbed him and i kind of laid it out for him
7997843 i said this is what you can expect from me and this is why
7997844 hes a bright guy and hes a very good player the worst thing that can happen is that the players off balance and he doesnt understand why im dumping on him he understands thats clear thats been said now its up to him hes going to be fine
7997845 i really feel he is the player we thought he was when we drafted him
7997846 honestly i dont think about what my role is going to be
7997847 my focus is just to be as good a player as i can be that includes special teams every day theres a lot to focus on as far as technique blocking running routes
7997848 its the highest level of football the tempo is much faster the speed at which you have to make decisions is much faster

7997851 should one be looking for ones soul mate the answer is no soul mates will meet when its time for them to meet and once they do no force on earth can ever separate them they will recognize each other and there will be no guilt feelings in the relationship
7997852 their relationship will encompass the totality of their being and their soul will expand and will be uplifted to heaven their happiness in each others arms will know no bounds and they will just live happily forever just like in the fairy tales
7997853 unfortunately one has to kiss a lot of toads before the sleeping princess meets her prince charming
7997854 we committed ourselves to building the world as it should be
7997855 he once had a heart attack woke up and sold the paramedics 12 dozen steak knives that was polski

7997859 no 2 i have absolutely no idea whether that makes any sense from a scientific from a practical point of view
7997860 we have a great track record of bringing substance with splash
7997861 esto ya ha sucedido en m xico tenemos clientes que lo han sufrido estas p ginas no s lo est n exhibiendo a una persona sino que dan informaci n de qui n compone la familia d nde y c mo vive y d nde estudia esto crea la posibilidad de un secuestro
7997862 this computer means everything to me its where i put my hope

7997866 they are two guys trying desperately to provide for their families but no one will give them a chance
7997867 you can say it was a short week you can say what you want but im not that type of guy
7997868 i completely take the burden for his loss i didnt execute and i didnt get in a rhythm to let the team drive down the field
7997869 when i got to daylight i saw receivers blocking and dan was out there
7997870 dan really took two and then i kind of weaved and dove over the top
7997871 thats how the running game is its 2 3 negative 2 nothing then all the sudden the big one hits
7997872 the running game is like that boxing match where a guy keeps hitting a guy in the body and it doesnt look like much early but later on they get tired of getting hit in the body and they let their guard down
7997873 i want to take the legs out of them so they cant rush
7997874 then theyll defend it then we have a chance to use the big guys outside
7997875 if theyre not rooting for the home team what are they doing here
7997876 its expected maybe if i was a lion id be a little disappointed
7997877 some guys will talk about the guys who didnt make the trip and did not play
7997878 but they had guys who did not play as well so you cant use that as an excuse
7997879 its nice to come here where ive got some good memories and where i grew up
7997880 now ive just got to find a way to help the team
7997881 youd be lying if you say you dont ever look back at the different decisions youve made but at each point in my life i made the decision that i thought was right and that i was comfortable with
7997882 ive had a great run and ive had a fun time
7997883 he might play well have to see how much he can pick up in the next couple days
7997884 were going to simplify the plays for him if nothing else hes going to have to be ready in case something happens to dan
7997885 he still has four years on his contract real madrid think they can ride roughshod over everyone they are not going to do it with us
7997886 their attitude is to hell with them theyd sit a player in the stand im telling you absolutely no doubt about it just to prove a point not to give in to these people
7997887 i can do this until the end of the semester and i can only assume that it will work the same way each time
7997888 bryce what is it called when natural laws are suspended what do you call it when water changes into wine
7997889 it cant tell you whats right and wrong it doesnt address ethics but it is not anti religion science and religion just ask different questions
7997890 cant test it cant prove it cant disprove it its not a question for science
7997891 but there is scientific proof that there is a god
7997892 over in turkey theres a piece of wood from noahs ark that came out of a glacier
7997893 if i could prove tomorrow that that chunk of wood is not from the ark is not even 500 years old and not even from the right kind of tree would that damage your religious faith at all
7997894 these atheists just arent knowledgeable about the subtleties details sophistication of true christianity islam religion
7997895 hey theyre system of government just isnt as fair as a democracy is
7997896 come back when youre ready to actually have a discussion
7997897 what makes your belief different stronger more real more supported than a person of a different religion
7997898 what would it take to convince you of the truth of another religion
7997899 det k nns som ni har fyllt upp ett h lrum
7997900 yall niggas keep talkin yo shit but you wont say ti to my face
7997901 what the american public doesnt know is what makes them the american public
7997902 t he problem here is not the presence of eros in our lives the problem occurs when every other thing is seen predominantly or only in relation to ourselves this is a selfish existence
7997903 when our motive for action is the attainment of our happiness the focus of our life is off center christian life should be centered on union and cooperation with god
7997904 two thousand years ago christianity produced a revolution of love in the social order not because it rejected
7997905 i n our day that which is erotic has become almost synonymous with that which is pornographic as a result many christians seem to think the only proper response to eros is to avoid it repress it and stamp it out in favor of a higher more spiritual love
7997906 western philosophy has emphasized intellect christianity likewise has emphasized the intellect in dogma and the will in morality as obedience to gods will philosophical and theological anthropology must be expanded to include the emotions
7997907 for where your treasure is there will your heart be also
7997908 i will rejoice in doing good to them and i will plant them in this land in faithfulness with all my heart and all my soul
7997909 he brought me out into a broad place he delivered me because he delighted in me
7997910 take delight in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart
7997911 we have all been with lifeless emotionally dead people such people have no strong delights or desires for themselves surely this is not the ideal of christian life a human life without eros is a life devoid of some of the major features of our identity
7997912 we find ourselves incomplete this incompleteness is the source of our search for wholeness or fulfillment armed with an infinite desire we find ourselves in a world of finite objects
7997913 lord you have made us for yourself and our hearts are restless until they find rest in you
7997914 a way of living desire it becomes one with desire
7997915 these words capture the core process by which god uses congregations to make disciples congregations offer the gracious invitation welcome and hospitality of christ so that people experience a sense of belonging god shapes souls and changes minds through worship creating a desire to grow closer to christ gods spirit nurtures people and matures faith through learning in community with increased spiritual maturity people discern gods call to help others through mission and service and god inspires people to give generously of themselves so that others can receive the grace they have known
7997916 for it was you who formed my inward parts you knit me together in my mothers womb
7997917 i praise you for i am fearfully and wonderfully made wonderful are your works that i know very well
7997918 you have made us for yourself and our hearts are restless until they find rest in you
7997919 my fervent wish for you is that one day you will come to know just how much god loves each of you for when you comprehend that you will be able to see how much god loves other people as well
7997920 may your whole life become a response to the truth that youve always been loved you are loved and you always will be loved and may you know may you know deep in the depths of your soul that theres nothing you could ever do to make him love you less
7997921 by asking for the sake of whom we are loving
7997922 love bears all things believes all things endures all things hopes all things love never fails
7997923 does not rejoice in unrighteousness but rejoices with the truth
7997924 loving you does not necessarily imply that your every wish is my command
7997925 love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you so that you may be children of your father in heaven for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous for if you love those who love you what reward do you have do not even the tax collectors do the same and if you greet only your brothers and sisters what more are you doing than others do not even the gentiles do the same be perfect therefore as your heavenly father is perfect
7997926 even one who has done me some sort of injury or harm has not shed his humanity on that account or stopped being flesh and blood a creature of god very much like me in other words he does not stop being my neighbor
7997927 it is spontaneous and generous it is self giving to the point of being self sacrificial and it is faithful
7997928 like jesus the saints do not simply calculate goods and evils rather their love often has a reckless quality to it living beyond minimum standards
7997929 an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
7997930 turned into laws however these exhortations would make social life impossible yielding to every legal suit and giving our goods away to everyone who asks whether they are poor or rich would soon make society a lawless place and leave most of us unable to function
7997931 if any want to become my followers let them deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will save it
7997932 be imitators of god as beloved children and walk in love just as christ also loved you and gave himself up for us an offering and a sacrifice to god as a fragrant aroma
7997933 thats right i follow him to the cross but not on the cross im not getting myself crucified
7997934 then i dont believe youre a disciple youre an admirer of jesus but not a disciple of his i think you ought to go back to the church you belong to and tell them youre an admirer not a disciple
7997935 my life the most precious possession i have to give for yours
7997936 as a universal principle self sacrifice is self contradictory that is if two persons each acted always self sacrificially toward one another neither could act self sacrificially each would insist on holding the door open for the other and thus neither would enter
7997937 the hour had come for him to pass from this world
7997938 the reason why agape is in principle the most enduring love is that its existence is not conditional on some return to us on its success in fostering the beloveds good or on some mutual relation with the beloved we may sit long seemingly pointless hours beside the bed of a sick stranger
7997939 this love remains firm even when the beloved rejects the lover the lord loves the people of israel though they turn to other gods hosea 3 1
7997940 agape says that no matter what you do or become i will love you agapes permanence is fidelity to the beloved which though it changes in time still is the same beloved
7997941 those in the community of believers may be intelligibly harder on themselves and so reproach one another for not going the second mile as well
7997942 let the duties required for a tolerable society be defended on publically intelligible grounds applicable to believer and nonbeliever alike but let each person within the community exhort others to go the second mile without reproaching anyone other than himself inside or outside for failure
7997943 i give you a new commandment that you love one another just as i have loved you you also should love one another by this everyone will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another
7997944 deny self and take up our cross daily and follow christ for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will save it
7997945 the bible begins with sex which is the one feature of human existence that both creation narratives specifically mention
7997946 there is nothing in the text itself that limits us to allegory
7997947 this does not therefore make the allegorical reading wrong but it reminds us that even our allegorical reading is dependent for its power on the ordinary human experience of eros if we cannot let song of songs speak of literal human love it will lose its power to speak to us of the love of god here the songs real importance to the holy scriptures and to christian faith begins to become apparent from first to last the bible portrays god as passionate
7997948 the pills were ethical because they didnt interfere with a persons ability to reproduce which would have been unnatural and immoral all the pills did was take every bit of pleasure out of sex thus did science and morals go hand in hand
7997949 society would collapse if people used sex for nothing but pleasure
7997950 more than 40 years ago the supreme court declared that no right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the election of those who make the laws under which as good citizens we must live and yet for more than 200 years the citizens of the district have been denied this right because they have no voting representation in congress
7997951 we dont care about your politics or ideology republican democrat independent kossack dittohead or just plain fed up with it all
7997952 ditch the politics of unity and purpose and earnestly take the fight to republicans
7997953 if we stay its going to be bad and if we leave its going to be bad its a false choice

7998184 considered the bible of a new reformed germany this text which condemned intellectualism science technology and modern society participated in the larger western critique of positivism at this time he wanted to recover what he considered lost german virtues simplicity subjectivity individuality which he located in the volk historian fritz richard stern has explained the rejection of modernity and of the rational scientific tradition which langbehn identified with it was the pervasive element of the book however incoherent its expression rembrandt as educator was dominated by a consistent aspiration toward a form of primitivism which after the destruction of the existing society aimed at the release of mans elemental passions and the creation of a new germanic society based on art genius and power langbehn placed rembrandt and art at the center of his vision of social change an age of art should replace an age of science
7998185 though it is well known that nietzsche and wagner were among the predecessors of the movement the intensity of german national feeling was held to be sufficient explanation for the rise of national socialist ideology today we are forced to realise that a more complex cultural development gave its impress to that movement long before it crystallized into a political party at the very center of this movement were ideas not so much of a national as of a romantic and mystical nature part of the revolt against positivism which swept europe at the end of the xixth century in germany this revolt took a special turn perhaps because romanticism struck deeper roots there than elsewhere this german reaction to positivism became intimately bound up with a belief in natures cosmic life force a dark force whose mysteries could be understood not through science but through the occult an ideology based upon such premises was fused with the glories of an aryan past and in turn that past received a thoroughly romantic and mystical interpretation

7998230 as if those guys on the news didnt speak english i mean they translated the national anthem from english maybe you should stop speaking hebrew being all jewish because it isnt very american after all or maybe culture and language doesnt have to divide us

7998249 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
7998250 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
7998251 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
7998252 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance

7998271 the remains recovered in may were apparently missed during the initial disinterment more than 100 years ago
7998272 it appears that they were forgotten or missed when others were relocated to another cemetery once we determined the full extent of the recovered items we turned our attention to identifying whose items wed found
7998273 the recovered remains include that of an adult male two children younger than age ten and an infant
7998274 frenchs actions in noticing the potential burial site and immediately stopping work at the location exemplify the kind of stewardship heritage programs encourages and expects from all oregonians
7998275 since the discovery peacehealth has been working collaboratively with several different partners including state agencies the university of oregon and descendants of the stevens family to recover the remains in a timely and respectful manner so they may be properly interred alongside the other members of this pioneer family
7998276 rafa will have a new image at the u s open
7998277 it is fair to say that it is more mature
7998278 he is just becoming known now that he has finally gotten over the federer hump
7998279 you would think they would want to embrace the youthful exuberance of his personality and his look then again nike does have a way with these things its hard to argue with their success

7998285 cafemom has become the largest online community for moms and we decided to harness that strength and enlist moms to help make a difference in schools across america
7998286 every school is always looking for a little extra to help fund a class trip buy supplies or splurge for a party and were just thrilled to be able to help out financially and to tap into the power of moms in order to make an impact
7998287 im so excited about this program because it has already introduced me to so many other moms who also want to be more involved in their childrens education
7998288 in this day and age where everyone is incredibly busy its so important for us to have an easy way for us to connect and stay updated on the events that take place in our childrens schools and lives
7998289 that image of him giving his acceptance speech in front of that crowd has lingered for all these years because it was unique

7998291 when you are a child faith is like a shot glass
7998292 and that one little shot is enough to satisfy you for you are small but as you grow up the cup becomes a goblet and the little shot is not enough so you must meet the challenges of the bigger cup and fill it with more than a shot
7998293 we have incorporated tmns products into our daily operations and theyve offered obvious value from the start
7998294 they improve our guests experience increase our profits and are simple for our employees to use
7998295 shows which tables are expected to be vacated and when as indicated by color coding on a floor plan of the restaurant as an application monitoring a physical environment seating management didnt set out to interrupt hostess work in any way if a hostess wants to seat five guests at a table that the database says has a capacity of four the system wont halt the running of the restaurant by saying that it cant be done maybe that party looked friendly enough that they can squeeze in an extra chair
7998296 our goal was to develop a product that is as easy to use as pencil and paper an application that will help hosts and hostesses to do their jobs more effectively and increase both revenue and customer satisfaction for the restaurant we are honored to be recognized by nng for achieving that goal

7998301 you changed my life i was bitterly disappointed when you told me i lacked then fire but i accepted your judgment
7998302 instead of becoming a 4th rate musician i went on to have a good life in the business world ive always wondered though how could you tell so quickly that i lacked the fire when i auditioned for you all those years ago
7998303 thats what i tell everyone who auditions for me that they lack the fire
7998304 what if i were to have become the next yehudi menuhin
7998305 you dont understand if you had had the fire you wouldnt have paid any attention to me

7998309 you can never have too many friends especially if they have food
7998310 i think it would work if the intention is there i have no doubt it would take off and kevin roberts and nigel melville are the right people to get it off the ground
7998311 once people over there see the game they are hooked on rugby
7998312 they just love it because the ball is in play so much more compared to football nfl and the players dont wear things like crash helmets
7998313 the key thing would be to get the media interested in the game to create tv and newspaper coverage beforehand
7998314 si daca nu se poate american atunci vreau sa fiu un pescarus sa zbor toata ziua deasupra apei sa ma iubeasca marea sa ma indrageasca soarele sa ma priveasca lumea sa ma adore indragostitii sa inspir artisti neinspirati s a m d

7998316 you are a selfish conceited 23 year old sell it
7998317 in other words it was one of the picnics that you attended within the last year
7998318 somehow the ridiculousness just struck me and i laughed and laughed
7998319 now lead your children from the craft area to the story area
7998320 analyze the details of your presentation then master the details by practice practice practice
7998321 needless to say my face turned red as i realized my error since this really was
7998322 and when we die and you are sent to heaven for doing your conscience and i am sent to hell for not doing mine will you come with me for fellowship
7998323 i bribed them to sing a song that would drive us insane and make our hearts swell and burst

7998329 im not gonna say any more than i have to if that
7998330 its its its indescribably beautiful it reminds me of the fourth of july
7998331 if you measured poverty today it would probably be much higher than the report said
7998332 for poverty and median income this was the worst economic expansion on record
7998333 the gains from the expansion that started at the end of 01 were concentrated among higher income americans
7998334 the economic recovery of the 2000s which ended last year has done very little to boost workers living standards
7998335 theyve done their part contributing to strong productivity growth but theyve far too little to show for it
7998336 a fund like this saves me time my most valuable resource
7998337 the mix of the fund matches the evolution of my financial needs
7998338 the track records of target date funds are not that long
7998339 we try to overweight sectors that will benefit from long term trends in supply and demand
7998340 we try to focus on stocks that are not dependent on a favorable stock market or a robust bond market
7998341 its not the size of the dog in the fight its the size of the fight in the dog
7998342 u s small companies are a contrarian place to be right now
7998343 most people are still stuck on that large company bandwagon but quietly small companies are outperforming
7998344 we liked the strategy but we didnt think the timing was right in terms of where they were in the cycle
7998345 people think i want to hold on to these resources what if something bad happens to one of my kids or one wants to start a business
7998346 id say he is both who he is and who he was
7998347 some people have bought it some have not but if youre going to be a p k and everyone hates you why do you think that just because youre trying to be cute and funny on air now that the same people are all going to start to like you
7998348 the bottom line is that the players from his generation and mine really dont want to have anything to do with him he did what he did as a player and there are consequences
7998349 in every generation there is a chosen one one girl in all the world one born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires
7998350 while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of bio fuel

7998352 most indications are that gustav will be an extremely dangerous hurricane in the northwestern caribbean sea in a few days
7998353 we had to leave the house before it got worse
7998354 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came
7998355 by any yardstick it was another rough quarter for bank earnings
7998356 as the industry coped with financial market disruptions the housing slump worsening economic conditions and the overall downturn in the credit cycle
7998357 more banks will come on the troubled list as credit problems worsen
7998358 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7998359 we knew that tree was dead we were all wondering when it was going to fall
7998360 cowboys cowgirls and indians especially provided and costumed for the occasion paraded the streets on broncos
7998361 would go out of their way to avoid a confrontation
7998362 he had plainly come many miles from somewhere across the vast horizon
7998363 even i could read the endurance in the lines of that dark figure and the quiet power in his effortless unthinking adjustment to every movement of the tired horse
7998364 there are patients who can fluently say something that sounds like a sentence but its just garbage
7998365 its one of the least understood disabilities in the world because these people cannot communicate for themselves
7998366 what makes the science very difficult in this field is that no two brain injuries are identical and therefore no two aphasias are identical
7998367 you know that smoodle pinkered and that i want to get him round and take care of him like you want before
7998368 the dog needs to go out so i will take him for a walk
7998369 its what youd do in italy youd use gestures to communicate things such as you need something to drink if someone gave you hell on the highway you wouldnt know what they were saying but you would know to back off
7998370 if its not the nodding up and down its the thumbs up or thumbs down
7998371 i start that right off the bat for folks with severe aphasia
7998372 to change the brain and then have the help change the brain in the right way
7998373 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7998374 ive known john for 35 years he served our country with extraordinary courage
7998375 have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7998376 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well
7998377 like president bush sen mccain is presenting the american people with a false choice national security or civil liberties we need a president who understands that we can have both
7998378 help carry out obamas agenda of change in a broken washington
7998379 he wanted to see how the decision sat with him
7998380 after having a president for eight years who cant go beyond talking points its a good thing that biden can dig into the issues even if he occasionally goes overboard
7998381 life is like a snowball the important thing is finding wet snow and a really long hill
7998382 he said he wanted to reconcile his public and private selves
7998383 multiple sources for everything of any significance in my book
7998384 im fine with the book and hope it sells well it treats me better than i deserve but im willing to adjust to that
7998385 its very curious because warren clearly authorized her to write this book
7998386 this is unusual a lot of money was spent on the book
7998387 he gave her access to his contacts his friends and the opportunity to get to know him better than any other writer which is what makes the book so outstanding
7998388 would we love to have warren buffett doing interviews for the book who wouldnt but were moving ahead as planned
7998389 people were beginning to slice him into tiny bits investor corporate manager whatever
7998390 i thought this man has a unified way of looking at everything it is one set of ideas the right book answers the question what events in his life formed this man and influenced him
7998391 he needed assurances from publishers he had never met that they wouldnt market the book in a way that presented him as the quasi author or that would make untrue claims
7998392 some books burn brightly week after week and thats our expectation here
7998393 theres a certain amount of mystery that shrouds him hes the last true business icon
7998394 to do this job you have to be able to sit still for a long time
7998395 for young people its not great fun to join our office
7998396 this athlete is from portugal so the jose in his name should be pronounced as ruoze rather than yuese
7998397 yes he must have pressed the wrong button when using the database
7998398 i know that its got to be my name its closer to my name than anyone else on the team
7998399 its all right for the athletes to come with their own chinese names but only our translations will be on their badge
7998400 taken the discussion out of that box that america tends to put people in and given some additional light on us as a people
7998401 i dont think it was his intention but it is what it is and he cant lessen that
7998402 obama will give our kids an image someone they can look at on television who looks like them
7998403 he gives our youth someone to look at and say look where you are
7998404 it is healthy for these discussions to go on it is also healthy that the rest of america is interested in those conversations if we stay within our communities our challenges wont be overcome
7998405 i didnt have the luxury i suppose the certainty of the tribe i hadnt grown up in compton or watts i had nothing to escape from except my own inner doubts
7998406 in their mannerisms their speech their mixed up hearts i kept recognizing pieces of myself
7998407 and thats exactly what scared me their confusion made me question my own racial credentials all over again
7998408 isnt a black american it exposes people to the fact that being black is a lot more than people assume the fact that the first black nominee for president is barack obama shows being black can be many different things
7998409 i have definitely heard parents and friends who are rwandan tell me you dont want to associate with african americans
7998410 and i am friends with african americans who will say look at those africans
7998411 my brother and sister are from kenya they have lived here for 30 years and are american citizens
7998412 they feel more comfortable hanging out with white people than african americans they feel african americans are angry all the time i have an african american friend and everything she talks about is race
7998413 but can we become so fragmented that we dont share anything
7998414 things that people view as important or their general way of thinking
7998415 obama hasnt sacrificed his blackness to get to the presidency
7998416 blue tie dark suit trying to lose the weight and i am not the only one
7998417 playing the role of the nonthreatening black works for me i went to boarding school and kenyon college and i have a masters degree
7998418 part of me has my fist clenched under the table
7998419 there is this feeling that black confrontational behavior wont be so acceptable we have to all play the game now
7998420 coming home from school and finding out the lights have been cut off
7998421 man up a plan for the spiritual and organizational retooling of black america

7998423 he is getting a pass as the black candidate when he really hasnt dealt with black issues his lineage hasnt been in the suffering in the struggle
7998424 you should see the emails i get from my girlfriends
7998425 we all want someone who lifts us up and praises us obama is raising the bar for black men
7998426 the fact that he didnt says a lot its important for my boys to see a love relationship that doesnt depend on skin types they see they dont have to be with a light skinned black woman to be successful
7998427 i wouldnt give a damn about him if it wasnt for michelle
7998428 he has enough fortitude and courage to let michelle be michelle
7998429 a lot of black men misunderstand that barack and michelle they both hold their own
7998430 a lot of my women friends are saying i want that in my life
7998431 barack and his wife are going to change a lot of views of black males
7998432 the males are going to look at barack and they will come back to the home they will be our role models
7998433 id love to have a print of this i wonder where i can find one

7998438 the english began to come to this country with the anglo saxon invasions of the fifth and sixth centuries after the roman legions withdrew
7998439 as early as 672 or 673 at the synod of hertford the then archbishop of canterbury had convened the bishops of all these various anglo saxon kingdoms excepting sussex which was still to be converted they met under his overall authority and agreed to unite as one spiritual and ecclesiastical realm i can find no other country existing as an ecclesial realm fully three centuries before the same borders her bishops observed became united under a single ruler quite simply england was an ecclesial reality before it was ever a physical kingdom its spiritual existence pre dated its political reality it was conceived in the womb of the church before it became a realm in law
7998440 if youre like me you want to squeeze a penny til it hurts
7998441 damn it these are blackmailing me and stealing my money
7998442 gold prices soar during instability and china is making things unstable
7998443 investing in gold before it becomes necessary is the best route plus what fuel holds the most promise in the near future
7998444 not only do international politics threaten the us economy and investing in gold is your best protection against that but so does our dependence on foreign oil what fuel can we produce to break those bonds
7998445 when chinas economic powerhouse becomes strong enough to confront blackmail and potentially destroy the u s dollar and the u s economy will you be among the losers or the winners

7998454 we are living in a pc world which is destroying us where you actually cant put the hard word on people when they have digressed and committed bad blunders
7998455 in the evenings we went to the rugby parties with the kids who slept in the back of the car we cant do that any more because we havent got rid of the perpetrators that actually destroy our society
7998456 my friends were my childrens role models and i was my friends childrens role model
7998457 the one thing i believe is important in life is respect they respected authority they respected teachers i respected the teachers we lack a great deal of respect for authority nowadays theres always someone protesting
7998458 the false and deeply offensive article in the dubliner magazine with the accompanying photograph of another woman wrongly claimed to be me caused great personal distress to me and my family
7998459 can you explain why the catholic church claims that the doctrines of sacred tradition were handed down from the apostles when there appears to be no record of it
7998460 as i said before the church having received this preaching and this faith although she is disseminated throughout the whole world yet guarded it as if she occupied but one house she likewise believes these things just as if she had but one soul and one and the same heart and harmoniously she proclaims them and teaches them and hands them down as if she possessed but one mouth for while the languages of the world are diverse nevertheless the authority of the tradition is one and the same
7998461 that is why it is surely necessary to avoid them heretics while cherishing with the utmost diligence the things pertaining to the church and to lay hold of the tradition of truth what if the apostles had not in fact left writings to us would it not be necessary to follow the order of tradition which was handed down to those to whom they entrusted the churches
7998462 it is possible then for everyone in every church who may wish to know the truth to contemplate the tradition of the apostles which has been made known throughout the whole world
7998463 but since it would be too long to enumerate in such a volume as this the successions of all the churches we shall confound all those who in whatever manner whether through self satisfaction or vainglory or through blindness and wicked opinion assemble other than where it is proper by pointing out here the successions of the bishops of the greatest and most ancient church known to all founded and organized at rome by the two most glorious apostles peter and paul that church which has the tradition and the faith which comes down to us after having been announced to men by the apostles
7998464 with this church because of its superior origin all churches must agree that is all the faithful in the whole world and it is in her that the faithful everywhere have maintained the apostolic tradition
7998465 the church is one and as she is one cannot be both within and without for if she is with novatian she was not with pope cornelius but if she was with cornelius who succeeded the bishop fabian by lawful ordination and whom beside the honor of the priesthood the lord glorified also with martyrdom novatian is not in the church nor can he be reckoned as a bishop who succeeding to no one and despising the evangelical and apostolic tradition sprang from himself for he who has not been ordained in the church can neither have nor hold to the church in any way
7998466 again we write again keeping to the apostolic traditions we remind each other when we come together for prayer and keeping the feast in common with one mouth we truly give thanks to the lord thus giving thanks unto him and being followers of the saints we shall make our praise in the lord all the day as the psalmist says so when we rightly keep the feast we shall be counted worthy of that joy which is in heaven
7998467 but you are blessed who by faith are in the church dwell upon the foundations of the faith and have full satisfaction even the highest degree of faith which
7998468 but the admonition that he cyprian gives us that we should go back to the fountain that is to apostolic tradition and thence turn the channel of truth to our times is most excellent and should be followed without hesitation
7998469 paul commands therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which you have been taught whether by word or by our letter 2 thess 2 15 from this it is clear that they did not hand down everything by letter but there is much also that was not written like that which was written the unwritten too is worthy of belief so let us regard the tradition of the church also as worthy of belief is it a tradition seek no further
7998470 with great zeal and closest attention therefore i frequently inquired of many men eminent for their holiness and doctrine how i might in a concise and so to speak general and ordinary way distinguish the truth of the catholic faith from the falsehood of heretical depravity
7998471 i received almost always the same answer from all of them that if i or anyone else wanted to expose the frauds and escape the snares of the heretics who rise up and to remain intact and in sound faith it would be necessary with the help of the lord to fortify that faith in a twofold manner first of course by the authority of divine law scripture and then by the tradition of the catholic
7998472 maybe if everybody hits it as straight as jim furyk i dont know if i can narrow the fairways but i can sure have the rough deep
7998473 but if i have a bunch of bubba watsons j b holmes pat perez phil mickelson guys that crank it and bomb it maybe there wont be rough i dont know yet well see

7998477 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
7998478 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
7998479 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
7998480 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
7998481 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
7998482 american businesses and consumers were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7998483 the overall mood is still one of caution theres not much out there to get investors excited
7998484 but the bigger picture is that there hasnt really been a major breakdown considering all the bad headlines out there from higher oil prices to the credit crisis and troubled housing sector
7998485 i have spent days and nights thinking about why i said what i did in front of the sec on may 25 2007
7998486 my statement before the sec was completely out of character for me i have tried to live my life in a way that showed that hard work and honesty were their own reward
7998487 everything about this looks like a strong storm that would evacuate platforms
7998488 we think energy prices are absolutely tied to the value of the dollar
7998489 an initial surge up in price but it may affect demand as well
7998490 is a big incentive to buy now versus later when you most likely wont have that option for you
7998491 it makes a lot of sense for builders to do a lot of promotions on that
7998492 were trying to let everyone know hey this is going away
7998493 however since 1978 more than 80 cases of lead poisoning associated with ayurvedic medicine use have been reported worldwide
7998494 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits
7998495 among the metal containing products 95 percent were sold by u s web sites and 75 percent claimed good manufacturing practices
7998496 current regulations governing the quality of herbal supplements made and sold in the us and india are inadequate
7998497 we recommend strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements manufacturers should have to demonstrate compliance with these standards through independent third party laboratory testing
7998498 although the current study focused on ayurvedic medicines reports of similar problems with toxic metals in other traditional medicines e g chinese mexican middle eastern and western herbal supplements have been reported saper noted
7998499 they continue to be so volatile and it is so difficult to predict the future because we cant get a handle on where grain costs are going to be on any kind of a long term basis at all
7998500 theyre definitely going in the right direction in terms of becoming more global in order to survive in the north american market
7998501 we believe you are offering a high risk test that has not received adequate clinical validation and may harm the public health
7998502 their the cdcs ability to say that theyre going to have ongoing reliable reports of incidence is somewhat questionable unless you have funding for that
7998503 has seriously degraded cms ability to meet its responsibilities in combating fraud and abuse
7998504 the poll shows how wrong the washington conventional wisdom has been on this race
7998505 international crises such as iran or russia and the nation of georgia
7998506 whatever momentum obama took into the summer he really appears to have lost
7998507 its as if his campaign has stalled a little bit or coasted
7998508 for 26 years in washington john mccains played the same old games we just cant afford more of the same
7998509 were going to come out of our convention even more unified than we are right now ready to take on john mccain in the fall
7998510 i honestly dont feel that obama has been in politics long enough to be running our country
7998511 the hillary clinton campaign may be over but the clinton factor remains very much a part of the election
7998512 do we still have work to do with folks who supported hillary clinton absolutely but weve been able to make great strides
7998513 theyve already voted once against barack obama and right now after three months of 20 20 hindsight theyre still not voting for barack obama
7998514 this is exactly the same kind of thing that hitler used to do
7998515 and the designer would say well i dont want someone who is that size
7998516 im like theres a lot of people out there that size with money to spend
7998517 was not a reflection of whats going on in the world out there

7998520 if i hear my weight ill want to lose weight and then ill be poor
7998521 the law is so obviously unjust and discriminatory it ought to at least be the subject of debate
7998522 were not for drinking we want to break the cycle
7998523 ive noticed a definite change in my attitude once it was no longer forbidden

7998526 to find that this amniotic compartment which we have traditionally viewed as somewhat sacrosanct is infected significantly more often than we thought is a little shocking
7998527 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these
7998528 we know that china is becoming increasingly important in political economic and intellectual life it is important that this great country should open itself to the gospel saint josef freinademetz shows us that faith is not an alienation for any culture or any people because all cultures are waiting for christ and are not destroyed by the lord but rather come to their maturity
7998529 saint josef not only wanted to live and die as a chinese but wanted to remain chinese even in heaven thus
7998530 he truly identified himself with this people and with the certainty that this people would open itself to faith in jesus christ
7998531 s ossetia votes for independence south ossetians are treating the vote as a celebration officials in the tiny former soviet region of south ossetia say more than 90 of voters have declared they want independence from georgia the authorities see sundays referendum as a first step towards eventual union with russia
7998532 scripture and tradition are the two expressions of divine revelation that set of beliefs that catholics believe god has given the church
7998533 that having been said one cannot underestimate the importance of the bible to the life of the catholic
7998534 who can claim to love god and not want to read his direct messages to us
7998535 i have not heard such blasphemies as i have heard on the floor of this council
7998536 the current holy father benedict xvi was much involved before his ascension to the pontificate in the call for a
7998537 he thereupon ordered seminary studies to be conducted in latin an order universally ignored since
7998538 there is a new wind blowing through the church today as the generation formed in the 1950s and 1960s ages and their experiments in various areas are weighed in the light of both church history and tradition and subsequent experience
7998539 there are many thousands of jews and many millions of catholics of jewish ancestry in the catholic church
7998540 if john mccain picks a pro abortion running mate hes likely to lose if he picks a pro abortion catholic as his running mate he will definitely lose
7998541 you just want a parish where the sacraments are available and reverently ministered where there may be a chance of exposition benediction and the rosary where the church has a confessional
7998542 the difference between the sexes is recognized in the physical psychological and ontological complementarity of the sexes i believe that equality is based in personhood and that men and women are different therefore women should not be treated as if they were men we should speak about men and women in their cooperation and difference and not create an ideology based on an individualistic mentality of femininity women should not have to imitate men because they are not men
7998543 every single time he was granted bail he broke the conditions
7998544 there must be a point where the court says tough
7998545 on the basis that if he breaches again he will be in custody
7998546 it seems in these circumstances the courts have been overly generous to this man
7998547 there is a presumption of bail pending trial for any defendant except in very grave circumstances given the severity of the crime and also given the risk to witnesses or the risk of reoffending in this case it is obvious the police are very concerned about him reoffending or breaching bail it seems strange that the district judge gave him the benefit of the doubt and permitted him bail
7998548 police do not take a decision lightly to object to bail they object to bail for good reason when they have cause for concern that the suspect may reoffend or break the conditions imposed by the courts of course we cannot remand every single offender or alleged offender in custody and there are a number of factors for the courts to consider but i think the courts should take more notice when police do object to bail
7998549 ive tried many web site monitoring services and nothing compares to alertsite
7998550 with alertsite we never have any surprises it warns us about performance problems long before our technicians or customers ever know something is wrong our web site is mission critical to thousands of event planners every month and alertsite helps us ensure the services they depend on are up and running optimally

7998554 theyre a great example of the integral role alertsite plays for online businesses that put a premium on customer loyalty and satisfaction
7998555 there are certain prime human emotions with which the thoughts of all of us are occupied a goodly part of the time tune in on them and you have your readers attention tie it up to the thing you have to offer and you are sure of his interest
7998556 what if you could do both at the same time
7998557 they would speak of a time gone by of the hardy prospectors who mined their silver of smoky saloons honky tonk pianos raucous poker games and painted ladies
7998558 they would speak of freedom independence honor the code of the west

7998562 so theyre lets see prohibited no banned no censored not quite forbidden no wait a minute yes thats it thats my headline forbidden cures
7998563 researchers have not yet found a way to quantify the effectiveness of emotion but i have come to believe that commercials with a large content of nostalgia charm and even sentimentality can be enormously effective
7998564 if you want people to act on your copy and buy your product first determine how your prospect is likely feeling right now
7998565 then use your benefits as bridges to activate the emotions that will compel him to buy

7998573 we randomly purchased 193 traditional indian ayurvedic medicine products from the internet about 60 percent were from u s companies and 40 percent from indian companies twenty one percent had significant levels of lead mercury and arsenic
7998574 many traditional indian practitioners believe quite strongly that if rasa shastra is done correctly it is safe
7998575 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits
7998576 its not an accident that ahpa members performed better weve called our members attention to the presence of heavy metals in plant materials lead is ubiquitous its in the soil and in the plants i dont think you can get these levels to zero but it is the manufacturers responsibility to know the amount and to limit it

7998580 the bill was inspired by an official audit covering a five month period in 2004 which found that because of the loophole the feds had to greenlight 35 out of 44 cases where a gun buyer was on a terrorist watch list
7998581 we found contrary to current recommendations that actually consumption of these foods did not increase the risk of diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding and didnt appear to increase the risk of developing diverticulosis or its complications
7998582 there are probably going to be a subset of people where perhaps a more restrictive diet does benefit them
7998583 if you are a patient with known diverticular disease and you have had the experience of eating seeds nuts and popcorn and developed diverticular pain as assessed by your doctor you should probably not have those foods
7998584 a family is a place where minds come in contact with one another if these minds love one another the home will be as beautiful as a flower garden but if these minds get out of harmony with one another it is like a storm that plays havoc with the garden

7998594 our work showed that all nine antipsychotic drugs we examined uniformly and more potently block the beta arrestin pathway downstream of the
7998595 some activated it some blocked the g side totally some blocked it only 50 percent the drugs had different profiles for the g protein pathway
7998596 so with this new information drug manufacturers would want to make sure new compounds for antipsychotic use block the beta arrestin pathway
7998597 there arent a lot of fancy rehearsed actions in wudang martial arts

7998609 in case anyone doubted that you were a wingnut this statement pretty much sums things up
7998610 im just so thrilled to be here and to have the opportunity to play because after the olympics it was obviously very disappointing
7998611 after beijing i thought you know i might not be able to compete here
7998612 i really tried to do everything possible for my recovery i even went to australia to see my doctor and to be able to practice
7998613 but they found a few cysts that were causing inflammation the doctor just did lots of treatment to me he is also a chiropractor so he fixed my back and my neck and everything was so connected

7998844 my people have been suffering for 21 years of war
7998845 the culture does not change the bible the bible changes the culture cultures that do not approve of the bible are left out of the churchs life people who do not believe in the bible are left out of our churches the american church is saying that god made a mistake he made adam and eve not adam and adam
7998846 asked whether there were homosexuals in sudan deng said they have not come to the surface so no i dont think we have them
7998847 this issue of homosexuality in the anglican communion has a very serious effect in my country we are called infidels by the moslems
7998848 where the protesters are in some parts of africa or in other parts of the anglican communion today is where this church and this society we live in was 50 years ago and for us to assume that people can move that distance in a year or in a relatively instantaneous manner is perhaps faithless
7998849 that kind of movement and development has taken us a good deal of pain and energy over 40 or 50 years and i think we have to make some space so that others can make that journey as well
7998850 no one takes issue with the fact that the episcopal church scrupulously followed its canons in electing and consecrating bishop robinson
7998851 excludes homosexual couples without question its application to singles and to remarried couples is not by any means as clear
7998852 bishops can never however much theyd like to be become the spokesperson of a single nation or cause or group however worthy they may be
7998853 also he spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others two men went up to the temple to pray one a pharisee and the other a tax collector the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank you that i am not like other men extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this tax collector i fast twice a week i give tithes of all that i possess and the tax collector standing afar off would not so much as raise his eyes to heaven but beat his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled and he who humbles himself will be exalted
7998854 why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners
7998855 those who are healthy dont need a physician but those who are sick do 9 13 go and learn what this saying means i want mercy and not sacrifice for i did not come to call the righteous but sinners
7998856 zacchaeus come down quickly because i must stay at your house today
7998857 he has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner
7998858 look lord half of my possessions i now give to the poor and if i have cheated anyone of anything i am paying back four times as much
7998859 today salvation has come to this household because he too is a son of abraham 19 10 for the son of man came to seek and to save the lost
7998860 a glutton and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners
7998861 the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of god ahead of you
7998862 with cheats and swindlers sexually deviant individuals gays and lesbians
7998863 and was freely having dinner with them without requiring that they first clean up their lives
7998864 first renounce your ways then we can sit down to eat
7998865 go and learn what this saying means i want mercy and not sacrifice
7998866 rights status or access to an equal place in the life worship and governance of this church
7998867 bishops can never however much theyd like to be become the spokesperson of a single nation or cause or group however worthy they may be therefore we can never simply be servants to one subgroup
7998868 we cant have any photographs or film of you entering the cathedral
7998869 because we want this to be a church for all people
7998870 a gentleman representing the dean and chapter of the cathedral
7998871 emphasis added gene was too self absorbed to take in who was addressing him
7998872 presumably by saying we want this to be a church for all people he meant that my being seen walking into the cathedral would cause others not to want to come
7998873 so you mean that i am not included in all people
7998874 so you mean i am not included in all people
7998875 decided not to legitimize the first conference with his presence and he was joined by the bishop of london
7998876 hegel remarks somewhere that history tends to repeat itself he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
7998877 if hes got something to say to us he should have come here to say it its a sign of how frustrated the boycotters are that the anglican communion is getting on with its business without them and its a very childish response
7998878 things have changed since 1998 what a difference a decade makes
7998879 the son of man came to seek and save the lost
7998880 david wept for his son and beat his breast tearing the hair of his head tormenting himself all manner of ways
7998881 pertaining to behavior or activity that does not measure up to standard moral or cultic expectations sinner
7998882 notice that he makes no excuses for his behavior offers no mitigating circumstances he is confessing his sinfulness before god and taking full responsibility for it
7998883 to cause to be favorably inclined or disposed propitiate conciliate
7998884 to be greatly concerned about someone in need have compassion mercy pity on or for someone
7998885 i tell you that this man rather than the other went home justified before god
7998886 to render a favorable verdict justify vindicate treat as just
7998887 the pharisee stood up and prayed about himself god i thank you that i am not like other men robbers evildoers adulterers or even like this tax collector
7998888 nothing that stops any of us from writing and speaking and being a part of our own communities
7998889 cessation of all cross border interventions and inter provincial claims of jurisdiction
7998890 the depositions are valid because they never showed up to object and they had each decided to leave anyway were just acknowledging the realities of the situation
7998891 are they an accurate description of the current state of our life together
7998892 decisions of great controversy without reference to existing collegial structures
7998893 there is distrust of the instruments of communion and uncertainty about their capacity to respond to the situation
7998894 the central focus of unity and mission within the communion with authority to speak directly to any provincial situation on behalf of the communion where this is deemed to be advisable
7998895 this poses the serious question of what response should be made to those who act contrary to the moratorium during the covenant process and who should make a response
7998896 in producing a covenant that defined who could be excluded
7998897 all our people minister pastorally and sensitively to all irrespective of sexual orientation and to condemn irrational fear of homosexuals violence within marriage and any trivialisation and commercialisation of sex
7998898 a lot of rain a lot of cars going back and forth down the street

7998916 was created in april 2008 not for the transfer of any property but to protect the name of the diocese from a competing claim to that name by any entity formed by tec
7998917 even worse they predict to the court that tecs bishops will proceed
7998918 based on charges instigated again by the calvary crowd that he planned to have his diocese withdraw from tec forget the anglican communion of which tec pretends to be a part the only communion that matters to tecs liberals is its own never mind yet once more that this reading is
7998919 formal admission into any religious body not in communion with this church
7998920 paragraph 2 of the order precluded separation from the episcopal church of property specifically held for or in the name of parishes within the diocese

7998929 what are you willing to sacrifice to keep the communion together
7998930 bishop charles jenkins bowed to the pressure of his politically correct interrogators oh now i see why they call it a press conference its because reporters press people into saying things and allowed as how he bought into the vapid idea that gays and lesbians of all people have franchise rights in gods church
7998931 why does rowan williams bow down before those belligerent african anglican bishops and their conservative supporters who view homosexuality as unnatural and a sin
7998932 the same old testament fundamentalism that leads to denying the discoveries of galileo or darwin
7998933 i have no ability to reverse or set aside any decision of the house of bishops nor does the house once the meeting of bishops is adjourned
7998934 it is a necessary duty of the leadership of this church to clarify the status of clergy who no longer regard themselves as members that is what deposition means in cases like these
7998935 it is not and is not meant to be punitive but rather clarifying in regard to the persons ability to function as a member of the clergy in this church we hold a theology of ordination that says it is indelible deposition does not affect that theological understanding
7998936 who must object during the meeting if they wish clarification no one did so
7998937 they can object but she will overrule their objections and when they appeal the ruling of the chair rule xv of the houses general rules says
7998938 bishop duncan and his supporters will never muster a two thirds majority to overrule her
7998939 thats why she is so confident she can continue unhindered in her course
7998940 the english bishops are afraid to wink without some permission from the state they are afraid of some opposition to this meeting or of its attracting too much public attention or somehow something might possibly in some way have a chance to happen and so they dont want to do anything
7998941 a place where gods life is revealed his promise and judgment the christ we are all called to reveal is one whose body is real who gathers gods children from the corners of the earth into his kingdom
7998942 we thank god for all who do this in their calling as bishops including especially those unable to join us
7998943 to be incapable of distancing oneself from the weaknesses of others
7998944 there were two addresses by archbishop rowan they were both thought provoking
7998945 respect is earned when it is thrown away gathering it can be difficult from the mother church of england there is the assumption that therefore we can do anything and africans will automatically come with us or respect us i think that is an insult
7998946 so now gafcon is an alternative to that where we can cry together look at our struggles hiv and aids problems infant mortality all those issues that dehumanise us as africans the wider anglican world if you ask my opinion dont want to listen to us

7999085 ab 2567 will further motivate parents to remove their children from the immoral public school system
7999086 with public schools becoming sexual indoctrination centers homeschooling and church schools are no longer parental options theyre parental imperatives
7999087 this is yet another example of the campaign to normalize homosexual behavior not just in schools but in our culture
7999088 young children will be forced to celebrate the life of a man whose claim to fame is his sexual orientation
7999089 parents should be outraged that californias lawmakers want their children to spend a whole day celebrating homosexuality instead of studying important subjects like math or science
7999090 every parent and student should call governor schwarzenegger and tell him to veto ab 2567
7999091 on harvey milk day exercises remembering the life of harvey milk and recognizing his accomplishments as well as the contributions he made to this state

7999096 you just cant tell people its all right to do whatever you want as long as you wear a condom it aids is just too dangerous a disease to say that
7999097 simply put condoms fail and condoms fail at a rate unacceptable for me as a physician to endorse them as a strategy to be promoted as meaningful aids protection
7999098 relying on condoms for protection can mean lifelong disease suffering and even death for you or for someone you love
7999099 saying that the use of condoms is safe sex is in fact playing russian roulette a lot of people will die in this dangerous game
7999100 but among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality or of any kind of impurity or of greed because these are improper for gods holy people
7999101 put to death therefore whatever belongs to your earthly nature sexual immorality impurity lust evil desires and greed which is idolatry because of these the wrath of god is coming
7999102 it is gods will that you should be sanctified that you should avoid sexual immorality that each of you should learn to control his own body in a way that is holy and honorable
7999103 in a similar way sodom and gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion they serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire
7999104 if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not practice the truth
7999105 little children let no one deceive you he who practices righteousness is righteous just as he is righteous
7999106 if you love me keep my commandments he who has my commandments and keeps them it is he who loves me and he who loves me will be loved by my father and i will love him and manifest myself to him
7999107 are not all these men who are speaking galileans then how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language
7999108 through men of strange tongues and through the lips of foreigners i will speak to this people but even then they will not listen to me

7999114 yvette on my way to work i bought you a cappuccino
7999115 for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of god
7999116 as it is written there is none righteous not even one
7999117 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life
7999118 he who did not spare his own son but delivered him over for us all how will he not also with him freely give us all things
7999119 be diligent to present yourself approved to god as a workman who does not need to be ashamed accurately handling the word of truth
7999120 but sanctify christ as lord in your hearts always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you yet with gentleness and reverence
7999121 preach the word be ready in season and out of season reprove rebuke exhort with great patience and instruction
7999122 i say to you my friends do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do but i will warn you whom to fear fear the one who after he has killed has authority to cast into hell yes i tell you fear him
7999123 then the pharisees went and plotted together how they might trap him in what he said
7999124 but jesus perceived their malice and said why are you testing me you hypocrites show me the coin used for the poll tax and they brought him a denarius and he said to them whose likeness and inscription is this
7999125 then he said to them then render to caesar the things that are caesars and to god the things that are gods and hearing this they were amazed and leaving him they went away
7999126 the scribes and the pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery and having set her in the center of the court they said to him teacher this woman has been caught in adultery in the very act
7999127 he who is without sin among you let him be the first to throw a stone at her
7999128 i do not condemn you either go from now on sin no more
7999129 but if i say i will not remember him or speak anymore in his name then in my heart it becomes like a burning fire shut up in my bones and i am weary of holding it in and i cannot endure it
7999130 you will be hated by all because of my name but it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved
7999131 if the world hates you you know that it has hated me before it hated you if you were of the world the world would love its own but because you are not of the world but i chose you out of the world because of this the world hates you
7999132 remember the word that i said to you a slave is not greater than his master if they persecuted me they will also persecute you if they kept my word they will keep yours also
7999133 but all these things they will do to you for my names sake because they do not know the one who sent me
7999134 and he has said to me my grace is sufficient for you for power is perfected in weakness most gladly therefore i will rather boast about my weakness so that the power of christ may dwell in me therefore i am well content with weakness with insults with distresses with persecutions with difficulties for christs sake for when i am weak then i am strong
7999135 let us not lose heart in doing good for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary
7999136 the effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much
7999137 somebody out there will imagine things that we in this room cant imagine
7999138 the risk is not expecting too much of humanity but too little
7999139 brian eno and i recently finished our first collaboration in about 30 years the name of the new record is everything that happens will happen today for the most part brian did the music and i wrote some tunes words and sang its familiar but completely new as well were pretty excited the album is available exclusively from this web site you can stream all of the songs for free and purchase it in a variety of digital and physical formats including a limited edition deluxe package designed by sagmeister inc all formats can be downloaded immediately and physical cds will be shipped in the fall

7999156 it was james danzigers idea he was planning his show to commemorate the anniversary and the book had fallen out of print when we started talking about the project we knew we wanted to add some of the outtakes that had been left out of the original edition
7999157 paul knew that there were some additional images at the library of congress
7999158 he hadnt been able to get down there to check it out so finally i got in touch with the loc and was very surprised to learn that some meant some 2 000 kodachrome slides
7999159 i spent about 10 minutes taking photos at the funeral then i had to get to the train that was my assignment
7999160 all i was thinking about was how to get access when we got to arlington then when the train emerged from beneath the hudson and i saw hundreds of people on the platform watching the train come slowly through it went very slowly i just opened the window and began to shoot
7999161 i went down again to the loc and made the final cut over a two day period james danziger had also visited the archive and had come back with digital snaps of his favorites which dovetailed nicely with my favorites there was an unbelievable amount of great stuff kodachrome slides beautifully preserved given the pristine conditions at the loc

7999182 god created the universe that is using a religious argument even though you seem to think it isnt
7999183 finally you state that you dont need religious arguments to defeat gays and lesbians

7999186 clearly she could not treat the glbt community fairly thus she was fired imagine putting someone who thought black people should still be slaves in a human resources job or someone who hates jews or muslims
7999187 not just the union of a man and a woman
7999188 but there are some penalties people have to go through if they dont have a legal marriage
7999189 i want to see those penalties which are put into place by religious beliefs gotten rid of
7999190 neil when a religion forces a change in the law that discriminates against another group of people that is wrong
7999191 these very same christians do not recognize that there are other people out there who are not christians
7999192 these people do not want to live under a law that is being driving by religious beliefs how about if the mormons or one of the thousands of other christian denominations make divorce illegal by way of the ballot or if they make stoning a suitable death for some crimes
7999193 1 when the catholic church is behind the push to stop gay marriages then that is when religion is pushing its beliefs on the rest of the population i dont see how you can be confused about this
7999194 2 you are going to have to wait a long time for me to speak out against the pro gay theology and the pro abortion religious people for one i am not christian and have never pretended to be on
7999195 secondly i dont know any pro abortion religious people i dont like the idea of abortion and i have stated this openly before i also dont like the idea of the government having control over womens bodies
7999196 i dont think that my belief that abortion is wrong should be forced on a woman who is pregnant and doesnt know what to do
7999197 3 i tried to read your argument about the sex of the parents and i didnt understand what you were trying to argue until you make it more clear i have nothing to say on it
7999198 4 i have already covered the issue of the color of skin and sexual preference to me both are immutable you believe otherwise but that is your belief
7999199 5 vote your religious beliefs i just want you to understand that in doing so you are trying to force your religious beliefs on the rest of the population yes that is what a majority vote is and i understand that i am just telling you that if someone wanted to put death by stoning on a ballot and it passes by a majority vote be prepared to be stoned at some point in your life i dont like it when a religious belief god made man and woman and that is why a marriage is a man and a woman is forced on everyone if you cant understand that simple statement then ask me again and i will try to explain it to you again
7999200 6 and that isnt anti religious bigotry here again you are assuming you know me which you certainly dont i have devoted the last 14 years of my life studying early christianity i teach about it ive learned the languages i have said this before and clearly you havent read much of what i write that i think christianity has done some good things and i have said that some christians have done great things but i have also written that they have done some bad things that isnt anti christian bigotry that is history if you dont like that i love christian history then so be it but to tell me that i am a bigot is ridiculous but you are free to believe whatever you want just dont force me to have to live undder your beliefs
7999201 i am just telling you that if someone wanted to put death by stoning on a ballot and it passes by a majority vote be prepared to be stoned at some point in your life
7999202 why on earth would i complain about any group that is giving me the same rights as everyone else
7999203 the fact that i have been given the right to marry in california does not in any way shape or form affect your marriage if you are married your marriage is your own business if you are having problems you cant blame my marriage
7999204 what does a woman bring that a man does not
7999205 there was no such thing as a marriage between two black people
7999206 also quit pretending that i am trying to silence religion
7999207 you refuse to understand that your religious beliefs are being forced on the entire population you might like that and prefer it but i dont and luckily the courts are seeing what is really happening
7999208 you ask me why gay marriage wouldnt lead to polygamist marriages and incestous marriages well straight people have been getting married for a long time and so far i havent heard the call for polygamy and incest to become legal therefore there is no reason that they would become legal with gay marriages it is a slippery slope argument and a ridiculous one at that
7999209 if islam ever takes over as the main religion it will be me defending their right to their religion and my right to live in a democracy and to live without their religious beliefs being forced on me
7999210 i never had a chance to do one scene the way it was written or the way i wanted it to be the script wasnt respected bad producers bad partners it was a terrible experience
7999211 the movie is supposed to teach us that the education of our children will mean the future of our planet all the action scenes had a goal they were supposed to be driven by either a metaphysical point of view or experience for the characters instead parts of the movie are like a bad episode of 24
7999212 a state of war is not a blank cheque for the president when it comes to the rights of the nations citizens
7999213 that party is over its a certainty that insurance industry profit margins including ours will fall significantly in 2008
7999214 after that however from what we learn from the stock markets in analogous phases of their dynamics such a long periodically decelerating phase is likely to dissolve and thus the market may start resuming the up trend

7999217 jesus said to them i am the bread of life whoever comes to me shall not hunger and whoever believes in me shall never thirst
7999218 do not labor for the food that perishes but for the food that endures to eternal life which the son of man will give to you for on him god the father has set his seal
7999219 i am the bread of life whoever comes to me shall not hunger and whoever believes in me shall never thirst
7999220 blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be satisfied
7999221 for our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of god
7999222 do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal
7999223 bishops can never however much theyd like to be become the spokesperson of a single nation or cause or group however worthy they may be
7999224 we can wonder how long such huge inequalities may persist in the face of ever closer contacts not least through television and movies where opulent lifestyles of the rich influence expectations and often breed resentment among the poor
7999225 should it be of concern to the rich perhaps if we believe that wide income gaps lead to immigration and resentment breeds terrorism for ultimately the rich may have to live in gated communities while the poor roam the world outside those few enclaves

7999260 i just move my hands over the computers and someone in the back is flipping lights and buttons to make it look like im doing something

7999263 when someone says so your car can talk so what so can mine
7999264 he is talking to nbc next week and we are working out everyones schedule i dont want to put him in just for the sake of having him drop by i want there to be a good reason for him being there and have it be part of the story i talked to david about a way of doing that and so far he likes it its a cool idea
7999265 he doesnt feel that way anymore i just talked with david the other day over breakfast at the beverly hills hotel and explained to him in great detail what we had planned for the show and he said he liked it and gave his approval
7999266 he has known bruce davison for a long time and when i met with him he basically gave me his blessing and i told him everything i wanted to do and he said thats awesome i do not want to get the fans hopes up or anything but im talking to nbc and hes talking to nbc and its all a matter of timing
7999267 she inspired me to be an actor when i was 6 and i saw her in a midsummer nights dream
7999268 its about the concept that certain people have the gift to read out loud
7999269 and when they read out loud the things in the book come to life
7999270 it was wonderful to get an opportunity to say things physically rather than have to use language
7999271 what attracted me to inkheart is very similar to the reasons i was attracted to virtuality
7999272 when you dont have parameters specifically within a genre which is partly fantasy driven when there are no rules i think all of our decisions are more important and i think the processes that we go through to make these decisions are more interesting
7999273 director paul w s anderson wanted me to sort of change and get prison sort of fit if you like and i just had an idea of me being really skinny and ripped and its sometimes good to give yourself a little challenge anyway to give yourself some discipline
7999274 hes very knowledgeable and a great motivator so about 10 weeks with him and a very strict diet and everything just fell away
7999275 take away sugar and you become a bit of a nasty person yeah you know its a bit of a sacrifice but for me its all part of the job
7999276 its not only an action movie it goes beyond that we have the humanity just so close to the chaos its frightening its talking about clones its talking about global warming its about terrorism its about the danger of science and i know im very afraid about the danger of science sometimes its great and sometimes it goes too far and its dangerous its about religion so its about all of that with the science fiction its not really science fiction to me its anticipation
7999277 its always exceptional for a french girl to arrive on this kind of project and to have the opportunity to be on this kind of huge set and action movie because were not used to shooting action movies in france
7999278 its very exciting and it happens maybe just one time in your life so i took it and it was great to have this experience and to work with vin diesel because hes such a nice guy i took a lot of pleasure and it was just a great memory i spent five months making babylon a d and everything was a dream every day on it it was crazy it was huge it was completely mad
7999279 i was intrigued to discover that the middle ages had had a love affair with reason logic and natural philosophy
7999280 i began to wonder more and more why they hadnt just gone ahead and had the scientific revolution then and there i mentioned this in passing to
7999281 this is philoponus experiment of motion on an inclined plane that galileo would later undertake
7999282 i decided to use the rediscovery of philoponus work in which he demonstrated aristotle wrong on many counts
7999283 historically this came late in the middle ages so i decided to let gerard of cremona translate it early in the middle ages and then let it percolate for a couple of centuries
7999284 i had to make a scientific revolution in the span of a single story
7999285 work that might take a lifetime or two was compressed into a single glorious summer what i tried to portray was something of the sheer joy of discovery when what was being discovered was something long familiar to the readers
7999286 it was interesting to find out how much more right aristotle had been than we are led to believe and the degree to which the scientific revolution that was depended on basically incorrect but reasonably approximate simplifications
7999287 were excited to tell atlantis stories on a bigger canvas
7999288 the successes of the two original stargate direct to video movies the ark of truth and continuum have shown us the opportunities that the movie format offers we have plans for both sg 1 and atlantis to remain vital as we expand the franchise

7999292 it was fun because i dont know tyrese jason and i are a lot of fun together
7999293 so its just like we just make jokes we laugh a lot of times but it was definitely a lot of fun to kind of give closure to it
7999294 so its like it was kind of fun to bring it back and i think too it worked perfect because we actually did all come back and meet up like the actual shooting happened after the movie so it actually was real in a sense that we all came back together again
7999295 it is a feat of technology and beauty ive admired too many times to count
7999296 but ill always remember the first time i saw it because my czech cousin david was with me and explained the legend of the clock that the man who commissioned it had the eyes of the clockmaker gouged out so that he could never build anything like it again
7999297 her father has been commissioned by the young prince of bohemia to design a clock in the center of faraway prague but when its finished the prince removes and enchants the clockmakers eyes deciding to wear them himself
7999298 when petra discovers that the prince has blinded her father she and her mechanical tin spider run away to prague hoping to sneak into the princes castle and steal her fathers eyes back
7999299 people are born with only one magical talent which often involves the ability to influence a material substance like metal glass or fire or it can be purely mental such as being able to see the future
7999300 magic usually manifests itself in the elite upper class it begins to appear when people are about 14 years old which is also the age when children become adults
7999301 these pamphlets were basically the 16th century equivalent of a bat boy found in cave tabloid
7999302 some renaissance people believed in magic so whenever i read a yellowed document about prophetic children or a woman who gave birth to 365 mouse sized babies i could never tell whether the writer thought it was fact or fiction
7999303 there was something interesting about doing a film that had the trappings of an action film but helmed by a french auteur
7999304 the toorop character playing a character that is that skeptical a character thats a cynic and not trusting i feel that there is a part of that in all of us
7999305 and to exercise that in the character to its fullest that felt exciting
7999306 me and director paul w s anderson were just riding over here in my truck watching some clips and i was just saying that this film has the formula
7999307 while we were filming it man it just felt like it
7999308 and then you know of course they used to shoot the whole movie then go do all the editing afterwards and now the new formula of course is to do all the special effects and do all the editing while youre still filming so while were on the set still filming theyre sending anderson dvds and hes showing us all these edits of all these action sequences that theyre doing now and it was just like yo it just gets everybody more fired up to keep going
7999309 i hope none of you leak the surprise at the end
7999310 but i felt like the sequel has been set up nicely and for me just in general i like doing one offs films that feel like theres only going to be one but im more excited about franchises you know what i mean i love the idea that were doing something so special that the audience would want to go see another one and another one
7999311 we tried to add texture to all the characters and backgrounds as if they were an engraving
7999312 for example youll see that jacks stripes on his suit are hand drawn and the hills behind also have hand made textures built into them additional details would be things like the leaves that sallie is stuffed with the bugs inside oogie boogie
7999313 there are hidden details there that have never shown up on previous dvds but will show up on the blu ray
7999314 oogie started out as the size of a pillowcase and not that scary or evil or important
7999315 as the story developed i felt the need to grow him in both his scale and his role ultimately danny elfmans oogie boogie song is what truly defined his character as the villain and jacks role was fully defined as a misguided hero
7999316 there have been discussions over the years about a possible sequel
7999317 when those discussions came up about seven years ago it was unsettling that it was suggested this time it would have to be done in cg im glad that did not happen
7999318 as far as coming up ideas for a sequel you have to admit there are a lot of other great holidays for jack skellington to take over
7999319 we really want to have some huge guest stars this year
7999320 we want to bring in other musical guests as well because of the dancing with the stars connection
7999321 im really really proud of the episode because it shows the range that the series can cover
7999322 even in a single episode you have this sort of emotional tear jerking kind of storyline but you also have what is basically a romantic comedy between jonny lee miller as eli and katie holmes its really kind of special that episode also introduces a major piece of mythology it is something that ties back to elis dad and it is something will propel the plot going into the rest of the season
7999323 a nonprofit do gooder attorney cut from the same cloth that eli is
7999324 they have phenomenal onscreen chemistry i have to say they really do katie sings and dances she has her own musical number which is a lot of fun im still waiting to see how the musical number for episode one turns out but i have to say so far katie has set the bar in terms of the quality of the musical number its easily the best one weve had on the show thus far
7999325 we designed that finale to work as a series finale god forbid we didnt get renewed basically the premiere takes place in real time it takes place six months after that last episode and its sort of designed for two things
7999326 thats sort of our mantra for the season you know those construction cranes that have been falling over in new york how about a massive construction crane accident in episode one crashing through girders then into the neighboring building were going to place one of our cast members in mortal jeopardy
7999327 ive long been inspired by the works of the british visionaries arthur c clarke olaf stapledon h g wells and many others
7999328 in particular i love clarkes the city and the stars and stapledons star maker one work that has received only marginal attention over the decades since its first publication is william hope hodgsons the night land which seems to have influenced clarke and perhaps even j r r tolkien cross clarkes diaspar and tolkiens mordor and you have the night land
7999329 the end of the universe is one hundred trillion years away but its about to change the lives of a trio of strangely talented young people in contemporary seattle
7999330 all three seek fortune in a way few others can by traveling laterally across the fifth dimension a multiverse of alternate realities they are fate shifters and that talent is about to bring them together and involve them in future evil on a cosmic scale
7999331 the hunters place ads in newspapers web pages graffiti on billboards asking one question do you dream of a city at the end of time
7999332 in these dreams they live lives that parallel their contemporary existence
7999333 their future counterparts are about to engage in a perilous adventure escaping from the kalpa to cross a surreal landscape laid waste by monsters from another reality in the typhon chaos all things are possible including the chalk princess time travel and an infinity of living hells
7999334 and the existence of all possible worlds all stories all reality and all dreams will depend on the outcome of their journey
7999335 we will complete animation on coraline in about six weeks and plan a february release of 2009
7999336 it concerns itself with a primal thought every child considers i wish i had other parents that and the button eyes
7999337 the movie version of coraline is very faithful to the tone and the spirit of the book
7999338 in the translation from book to film there are adjustments to story and character that have to be made the main thing i always felt was i could not disappoint the readers of the book and though some details have been changed as well as the order of the sequences i feel we will be successful
7999339 there is no doubt that there are some similarities between the two projects
7999340 i also have many of the original nightmare team members working on coraline weve all grown and the visual aesthetic is ultimately a very different one youll see great animation like nightmare like a cousin of nightmare more like a second cousin the last thing id want to do would be to try to rip off a classic film i directed
7999341 it just gives you more of what is there just a little more sense of the reality of this medium
7999342 it does not live in the computer nor is it a series of drawings its an actual real set of puppets
7999343 as an actor you really hope that you can get a big variety and its hard
7999344 its a money driven business its more secure to hire actors that you know they can deliver this and they can deliver that its harder to take chances understandably and i love that its a completely different genre i love that im playing arguably the most evil woman on the planet and i had a hoot every day at work
7999345 their reality is so different the place where theyre coming from
7999346 as the movie sort of explains prisons have turned into these corporations that are privately owned and theyre geared to make money and shes a very high powered sort of ceo in a lot of ways i think of this person and shes interested in the bottom line only and so its actually very fun to play somebody whos just completely evil
7999347 it was the line that my agent and my lawyer kept teasing me about
7999348 i had been posted to serbia and was writing about the nationalist atmosphere in the capital belgrade when i ran across an ethno musicologist named simonida who started talking about vampires
7999349 she told me that the popular image of the vampire the fanged creature who rises from the dead to suck the blood of the living had its origins in serbian folk tales and that she personally knew several vampires would i like to meet them i declined but her invitation fired my imagination
7999350 she wants to do a preliminary interview with torgu to see if he will make a good subject for a segment on her show known as the hour
7999351 when he turns out to be completely inappropriate for television and far more than just a mobster her business trip turns into a nightmare she has to outwit him to survive meanwhile back at the offices of the hour her disappearance is the first in a chain of mysterious events that come to panic and terrify a seasoned and cynical staff of journalists
7999352 i can remember having the feeling that the world was being remade in smoke and fire before my eyes
7999353 the offices of 60 minutes were already sort of spooky filled with the ghosts of television past as well as familiar faces names and voices of that past lingering into the present people like mike wallace and morley safer who id been watching 20 years before as a kid in my parents living room the atmosphere at 60 minutes was heavy with a sense of the past my own and the shows almost gothic to experience 9 11 in that atmosphere was to feel a deep amplification of the terror that was already onscreen the book began its life basically on that day
7999354 let me tell you its a really difficult way to make films
7999355 you can see why people use a lot of cg because theres nothing easier than just shooting an empty plate and creating it all in the computer six months later to put the stunts in this movie on screen as spectacular as they are to do it all for real and not kill anybody was a huge undertaking and everyone was very excited about the idea of doing that
7999356 i was heavily influenced by movies made in the 70s and 80s that i grew up watching
7999357 walter hills the driver peckinpahs the getaway french connection bullitt road warrior death race 2000 i mean the list goes on and in particular road warrior where i remember i borrowed my mothers mini to drive to the cinema to go and see it me and my friends and i remember being so energized when i left the cinema that i just wanted to take that mini and drive it into the side of a truck and i dont get that visceral thrill from many action movies nowadays because its not real you know you can see that its cg and its spectacular but you dont have that kind of visceral thrill of seeing real things get crunched up and the real sense of danger that can give you and i wanted to go back to making one of those movies
7999358 nobody had ever done that before taking a 75 foot truck driving it at 60 miles an hour to a dead stop and seeing what happens
7999359 seeing statham do all his own driving it was really stressful
7999360 theres some great scenes like when he does the 180 in the mustang you can see the g force on statham when hes doing it i mean thats because hes really in a car driving at 60 miles an hour and throwing it into a 180 and you cant fake that and i think it gives the movie a real sense of reality
7999361 and the guy cant see where hes going hes half blind because the lights shining in his eyes seeing him do these stunts and not on a normal race track on a dirt track with like metal posts and concrete pillars i mean it was dangerous
7999362 it goes into the story of king saul and david and goliath
7999363 and theyre moving through the whole story its a modern version of that new york just happens to be the capital of this country called gilboa new york is shiloh a country theyve rebuilt
7999364 king silas in the script and then this young up and coming kid called david who i think hello is trying to take my throne he wants to be king and its good to be king nobody wants not to be king
7999365 well see if the follow up scripts are as good as the pilot
7999366 were working on it now which hasnt been officially announced it will be released in 2010
7999367 dawn thinks garry is going to try to stop the wedding because he is still in love with her

7999520 this is not the first time we have had a worm or a virus
7999521 its not a frequent occurrence but this isnt the first time
7999522 were just trying to cover everything and make sure we havent left anything out in preparation the scariest part is going into a game knowing that you cant cover all the basics in the first game theres going to be some kicking game mistakes well probably have some turnovers well probably bust some assignments on defense its the typical first game kind of stuff that drives you crazy
7999523 you want them to be nervous but not to the extent that its going to force them to not play full speed or to be cautious sometimes you can go out there and not play as hard as youre capable of thats going to be our goal to see if we can play real hard for four quarters
7999524 the new coach is the biggest problem that was a problem for us last year but at least we knew some of the boston college players unfortunately we knew bc quarterback matt ryan pretty good we dont really have a good handle on the talent at baylor we feel like they are a very talented football team we just dont know what their strengths and weaknesses are with them having a new coaching staff were not really sure what were going to run into weve had to prepare for a lot of things and we wont know until the game starts whether weve prepared well or if we have a lot of work to do by halftime
7999525 it puts a little pressure on us i thought there was some pressure a couple of years ago when we were trying to get some momentum to build deacon tower over at the football stadium with the expectations through the roof for this football team i think theres a little bit of pressure i hope we handle it better than we did last year i didnt think we did a very good job in the opener against boston college last year we played a good football team but i dont think we played very well were really just trying to focus the team on taking care of the deacs were trying to make sure that we worry about us and not as much about the team were playing i hope we play a better football game to open the season this year than we did last year
7999526 its pretty good its probably as good as it has been since ive been a head coach weve really had no serious injuries in august and i think we worked pretty hard sometimes i think you can avoid injuries by not working hard i think weve worked pretty hard were a pretty healthy football team we should kick the season off with a pretty healthy football team
7999527 theyve done a really good job in the spring i wasnt really pleased with our seniors i thought our seniors were just playing and not doing much leading they werent talking much with the younger guys i didnt feel like there was a seriousness there when we got back in the first part of august our guys were really serious i think they didnt see the spring the way the coaches did this summer theyve been dynamite i think our seniors have taken a great sense of responsibility for our team theyre really working hard and trying to set a good example by the way they work i think theyve really been encouraging to our freshmen and our younger players i like the feeling on this football team right now
7999528 i am very excited i am so tired of seeing those other white jersey across the way i was telling riley skinner earlier that i am so happy that we dont have to go against you guys anymore its so boring im the excitement is high on the team around the community and in our coaching staff im just happy im happy to play someone else besides my own teammates
7999529 coming in as a freshman i can remember that there wasnt even this many people in this room on tuesdays just to know that people are starting to notice the hardwork and the success that weve had over the past few years is refreshing its kind of surreal that people are talking about wake forest espn is talking about wake forest which has never happened
7999530 i dont know if you can ever feel comfortable till the end of the season i am satisfied with how hard we worked over the summer and during the fall season i happy and excited about our game plan going in and well just have to see what happens thursday night
7999531 you never know before the season starts thats the thing about preseason predictions you havent done anything yet we havent even played one game so its all based off your potential and what we did last year we have a new team new style of playing new coordinators and new freshmen players coming up so we have to understand that we havent done anything yet and that we cant relax and be satisfied with the predictions we have to go out and do it
7999532 we played a big xii team in nebraska at the beginning of the season last year so we expect baylor to be just as tough as nebraska was with them having a new coach in art briles we had to watch film from places where hes coached and we learned that he is an offensive guru we know we cant go in and under estimate any of his teams they play really hard and really smart
7999533 we all give each other this look like oh this went by really fast we know this is our last year and our last chance to leave our mark on wake forest we know that were the leaders on this team and we know that this team will only go as far as we take them
7999534 i think this is the quickest and best team ive been on definitely we have two defensive tackles that run like defensive ends we have safeties that run like corners and linebackers that run like safeties this is probably the best team ive been on since ive been at wake
7999535 im pumped ive been itching to start all week im not itching for the plane ride but weve been going against our same defense for too long were sick of seeing them and were ready to go against someone else i think were at a really good place with our offense defense and kicking game were really all on the same page right now and were ready to get down to texas and start the season
7999536 im really confident in them i have all of the trust in the world i know they are going to play their hearts out every snap and that gives you a lot of confidence as a quarterback theyve been playing real well through camp and theyre all on the same page theyre all real good buddies and a tight knit group i think thats helped them communicate well on the field schematic wise this is probably the most ive ever conversed with the o line after every play when we come off the field after a play or a scrimmage i ask them what they are seeing and they ask me how the protection is and where the pressure is coming from we are really meshing well together which i didnt expect to do so well
7999537 its been a little different mainly their personalities are different a lot of the schematics are the same how the meetings go and watching film hasnt changed too much its been great though i still talk to coach mullen a good bit up at west virginia we keep in touch a lot talking about life and a little bit of football every now and then
7999538 i have a great relationship with coach elrod having been recruited by him hes a lot of fun in the meetings we can joke around with him a little hes easy to laugh with but when it comes down to it hes a smart coach hes been at the quarterback position and he knows what it takes to win hes taught us a lot and hes kind of calmed me down this spring and at camp this fall helping to let me play and then well get after it hard in the film room i kind of like it that way because i dont come off the field and get a mouth full and then it sticks in my head this way im not thinking about what happened the last play and its allowed me to play with a lot more confidence and poise
7999539 a win im really looking forward to seeing how our offense performs weve done really well on our defense but its been a defense thats seen our plays for months now its going to be interesting to go against a team with a new head coach and a new coordinator its almost like were taking a shot in the dark going against their defense im really looking forward to see how well perform i also want to see how our new guys perform im excited to see brandon pendergrass run we all know josh adams can do it so having that duo in the backfield is going to be awesome seeing d j boldin and ben wooster we really have a lot of guys that are ready to kind of prove themselves and im ready to see them do that
7999540 yes he kind of did during the spring i think a lot of it was because we never threw to our tight ends as much as we have lately during the spring it was new to our defense so it was easy to get him the ball they started to pick up on that now and we have really started to spread the ball around nicely i cant really tell you if there has been one go to guy this whole camp d j has had a really good camp we threw a lot of balls to him bens had a lot of catches so has marshall and even the fullbacks have caught a good amount of balls were spreading it around a lot and i think thats going to make it tough on defenses we just need to execute what weve been coached to do
7999541 we know how much those predictions mean now were picked to do well and two years ago we were picked last in the conference and we ended up winning the conference thats just kind of a hope and an imagination type thing people are just throwing names and number out there before anything has happened before you even play a down of football you feel like you should be handed a trophy thats not it and we know that i think being on both ends of the spectrum has really helped us stay grounded we know that we cant let that stuff get to us
7999542 no im not really a numbers guy ive always played in an offense that isnt numbers savvy they arent orchestrated to get one player unbelievable stats ill tell you a win is a lot better than a lot of numbers we experienced that against boston college last year we completed like 76 percent of our passes and had like 400 yards passing but we still lost your not going to remember those passing yards your only going to remember if you won or lost at the end of the season there are only two numbers that really real mean a lot to me and thats interceptions and wins i want the wins to be high and the interceptions to be low
7999543 its scary to think that people are giving us all of this preseason hype as opposed to being picked last in the acc every year were just making sure nobodys feeding into the hype were making sure everyones still humble and nobodys getting a big head they dont give out awards for potential they give out awards at the end of the season when everybodys proven how good they really are
7999544 im very excited ive got my butterflies going already when the ball is kicked off its all football right now im a little nervous but im sure ill be fine once we kick off if you ever go into a game and youre not nervous somethings not right
7999545 i think it gives you more freedom to just fly around and play football you react to everything instead of doing too much thinking you can just go out there and play once the third and fourth quarter hit then you have to relax a little and be mentally sharp but that first half its all going to be flying around just playing football
7999546 its good to see how the programs changed the program has grown a lot were going from maybe filling up the stadium to putting in extra bleachers and people fighting over tickets its a good feeling to be part of this change and being part of the history
7999547 it seems like just yesterday we played at the meineke car care bowl but now were within two days of gameday and its very exciting
7999548 i can totally feel the difference from my freshman year when i first came to wake forest things picked up the orange bowl year and this year with the meineke car care bowl but i think this years going to be our biggest year
7999549 you want to stay focused you dont want to brag too much to the outside people but at the same time as a team we know what we can do theres a lot of camaraderie and the guys are really fired up to come out and play football so were pretty excited
7999550 with kenny gone theyre looking for a guy to step up i took on that role the spring of last year and i think i carried it over well through the summer right now i think im ready i feel ready for that challenge last year i think i waited a long time for this opportunity but its here now so ive got to step up

7999585 though most of the book remains a slow moving affair when toll the hounds kicks it into gear it delivers on all fronts moreover it sets the stage for whats to come still i have to concede that the ending likely saved this one from being what could have been the weakest volume of the series

7999845 he played keyboards and alto sax too he and songwriting partner david porter could read each others minds almost
7999846 you dont miss your water until your well runs dry
7999847 we saw the tremendous reception we were getting in austin and at the hollywood bowl and thought maybe we should put more shows together

7999849 stax was like a family and we still have that feeling today we stay in touch they are still tremendous talents you stand in the wings waiting to go on and youre taken back to the 60s
7999850 thats hard to pinpoint i like the cream version on the 1968 album wheels of fire koko taylor and buddy guy did a good job and jimi hendrix did an instrumental version that i like
7999851 if you write a good song it can be recorded in many styles people from any genre can identify with it i have been blessed that i have four or five songs like that
7999852 our rhythmic feel was a little different the others were a little more polished than we were motown was middle american atlantic was a little more urban we were just kids who had been exposed to blues gospel and rockabilly stax was geared to the common person if you went to church on sunday you liked what we did
7999853 whats that in the wall a big tank filled with giant crab that i have to pick out and eat and uh why are they rolling those little carts around this sweet and sour chicken doesnt taste at all like panda from the mall
7999854 whats this dough ey looking thing and whats in it oh its a dumpling this is good can i have another i really want to order one of those giant crabs grab me some of those egg custard tarts when they roll by again will ya this is fantastic where has this place been all my life
7999855 we thoroughly deserved it and the biggest disappointment is we didnt get as many goals as we deserved
7999856 i said to the players before the game that it is a fantastic stadium and a fantastic pitch so make sure when you get on the bus you have no regrets
7999857 people will now look up and down the country and see that northampton have won at a premier league side
7999858 he has physical presence and is a big player for us he suffered a head wound against cheltenham and it re opened last saturday
7999859 we just keep stitching him up bandaging him up and putting him out there
7999860 he is still not 100 as he is coming to terms have the steel rod taken out but is making progress
7999861 we just shut him down during the week and roll him out for games he bullied danny shittu and gary cahill
7999862 they put the big guns on and we had to defend but the most important thing is for us to get back on the bus with happy memories enjoy it and we now have to concentrate on tranmere on saturday

7999864 i had a lot of things kind of open up for me and when the role of kenickie was offered its something that ive always wanted to do as a kid
7999865 i grew up on rhythm and blues and i own nearly everything marvin gaye ever recorded
7999866 i re listened to all marvins music and it was interesting to hear his growth from the early 60s to the mid 70s
7999867 man what a time everybody was really stretching pushing themselves to the max marvin always had a jazz attitude i need to play the real stuff when they didnt bring it to him he took it upon himself to bring it to them
7999868 i wont be presenting any particularly radical rearrangements in this festival setting and in this city i think people want to hear the music and connect with their personal reminiscences you dont want to do too much to disguise that so ill stick reasonably close to the original script i have however written an overture of sorts based on a number of marvins themes it will allow us to ease into the set and work any butterflies out
7999869 marvin would sit at the piano and sing sinatra and nat king cole for hours theyd let him do as much of that as he wanted on his own time but he couldnt put it on wax that frustrated him greatly
7999870 marvin gaye could sing anything he put his mind to
7999871 in a way that many of the other producers did not marvin understood and appreciated the fact that most of us came from jazz backgrounds he was no real threat instrumentally he could hold his own on piano or drums after a fashion but we loved him because he possessed the soul of a jazz musician
7999872 they were all excited not only to work with christian but to play the music of marvin gaye jazz is the music of the moment and playing it is the art of living fully in that moment marvin worked with emotion in much the same way
7999873 in his guewel project drummer composer harris eisenstadt mixes his avant jazz expertise with an extensive knowledge of funky intricate african music fortunately his bandmates saxist josh sinton plus brassmen taylor ho bynum nate wooley and mark taylor can shift convincingly between boisterous and abstract modes
