370000 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
370001 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
370002 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
370003 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
370004 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
370005 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
370006 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
370007 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
370008 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
370009 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
370010 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
370011 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
370012 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
370013 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
370014 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
370015 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
370016 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
370017 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
370018 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
370019 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
370020 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
370021 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
370022 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
370023 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
370024 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
370025 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
370026 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
370027 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
370028 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
370029 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

370035 the focus on foreclosures and subprime lending is ongoing and coupled with higher inventories of homes for sale is prompting many would be buyers to play a wait and see role
370036 however well maintained homes with curb appeal that are priced for todays market continue to sell its often a matter of counseling buyers and sellers to set realistic expectations on both sides of the transaction
370037 first time buyers continue to be impacted by tighter mortgage underwriting standards and the affordability challenge which has not improved significantly despite price declines in most regions of the state

370048 the housing bubble was greenspans doing pure and simple he gave birth to it nurtured it protected it and guided it during every stage of its development in fact if there was a deck of playing cards featuring the key players in this debacle alan greenspan would be the ace of spades the fact that the media still holds this joker in such high esteem is a testament to just how clueless they are rather than fawning over his every word journalists should be grilling him like a cia interrogator

370190 for a while there i was turning everything into mosaic art
370191 one day i was looking at my bowling ball and i thought it would be an interesting piece of art for the garden so i covered that in mosaic tiles
370192 then i was at a garage sale and this person was selling a planter which i thought was perfect to hold the bowling ball so i bought that and tiled it too
370193 because its clear and it holds up well if your piece will be outdoors
370194 but vitreous glass is my favorite because it catches the light nicely and it glitters

370224 the government has been unbelievably complacent about the uks record on greenhouse gases
370225 the reality is that we have simply exported our emissions to countries that do the manufacturing that we used to do in the past
370226 rather than hiding behind dodgy data and relying on green gimmicks the government need to make urgent changes to move the country to a low carbon economy
370227 there now is no question that this harm is being caused by human activity its warming up the planet and melting the glaciers
370228 there is nothing in the u s hurricane damage record that indicates global warming has caused a significant increase in destruction along our coasts
370229 warmer air can carry more water and this means more heavy precipitation in the central united states big midwestern storms that used to be seen every 20 years or so will likely occur every four to six years by centurys end
370230 global warming can mean colder it can mean drier it can mean wetter thats what were dealing with

370238 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
370239 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
370240 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child

370262 vijf jaar geleden had ze misschien niet bij o ns gepast maar ze is volwassener geworden katja is getrouwd en haar wilde haren een beetje kwijt

370284 we were never saying that he should be set free

370362 its important for internet users and american consumers in general to understand what information is being collected about them and how its being used
370363 online users have a right to explicitly know when their broadband provider is tracking their activity and collecting potentially sensitive and personal information
370364 this study suggests that doctors may want to start reviewing the diet of children during early well child visits
370365 by the time they reach eight years old theyre already far into the overweight category making treatment more difficult
370366 i didnt think that that obesity would start that early
370367 information on family history and the dietary and exercise habits in infancy
370368 we may then have to look prospectively to see what interventions work in reversing this trend
370369 not many people have thought seriously about the interactions between a superfluid and a superconductor that are co existing like this
370370 we found that the boundary wasnt just shifted but new behavior appeared when the superconductor is on the edge between type i and type ii
370371 we were surprised that there was anything new to mine here
370372 but slightly different behavior thats the next step in our research and its already being done which is pretty neat
370373 it has been in the family since around 1760 and it belonged to a benedictine convent before that

370375 i have had so many mostly estate agents from austria neighbouring bavaria and germany
370376 we manage most of the austrian lakes so by principle were interested in taking over the mondsee
370377 we recently made an alternative offer to mrs waechter well manage the lake for her for free for two years during which she will continue to receive revenues from it and then well make an offer to buy
370378 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
370379 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
370380 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
370381 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
370382 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care
370383 it seemed like they were more interested in going to lunch than hearing from shareholders
370384 at no point did this board or management in any way ever resist microsofts proposal

370395 its the first proof of concept of such malware with no code injection no interfering with the kernel
370396 we believe people need to be prepared for this theres a popular demand for web 2 0 but its a bad situation in that weve given huge power to browsers but these browsers often have logic flaws that allow these attacks
370397 this attack involves a special packet which has the effect of disconnecting the endpoint
370398 the research which surveyed some 214 us e banking sites is notable as many of the site flaws cannot be fixed by a software patch but are structural in nature short of many of the site operators designing their portals from the ground up its likely there is no short term fix
370399 e banking offers companies a high degree of convenience but the risks for businesses are far greater than for consumers as business balances held in bank accounts can easily run into four or five figures
370400 professor atul prakash and his team plan on revealing the details of their in depth research this coming friday and it will be interesting to see how their paper is received some banks are reported to have reworked their sites as a result of the team notifying them of their problems but i suspect that many will take time to change their portals
370401 weve said for some time that behavioural analysis is an intelligent safety net for companies looking to protect themselves against unknown as well as known security threats this is an example of that type of threat which can easily escape the attentions of conventional security software this research clearly confirms the vulnerability of any enterprise that chooses not to monitor the behaviour of their systems and users for unusual activity

370453 he didnt pee at all yesterday i think he was just so nervous
370454 where we are economically were cutting jobs i think its kind of hard to talk about a pay raise
370455 if the legislature wants a sort of collegial respect im giving it to them
370456 yes youre part of the process now what is your solution here and im not hearing any
370457 well find out whether or not the legislature wants to recognize how to control the spending
370458 people are going to have to choose the areas where they think should be cut and so far all im hearing are the places that shouldnt be cut
370459 i really dont want to discuss the issue of taxes because as soon as you do it perpetuates the addiction it was taxes in many ways that got us here
370460 if we got it down to 2 billion or something like that and we wanted to tax somebody to finish it off or even to create a surplus considering that perhaps the national economy might drop further id think about that
370461 if we wanted to show real resilience we would have put our best minds together and built that area up right away and not let it turn into the latest real estate boondoggle which is what we did
370462 i rode it out for as long as i could

370479 we expect to earn rs 30 000 to rs 40 000 crore through this 3g auction
370480 we will roll out an all india 3g network in six months starting from the north and east
370481 the governments plans to allocate additional spectrum should ensure the fullest possible breadth of competition in 3g services
370482 this will surely push our valuations up since new players who win bids for 3g will have to tie up with us for 2g
370483 you cant sustain a business in which 10 players are fighting for only 70 million 3g customers you need a mass consumer base of 2g subscribers to survive so getting 2g spectrum with 3g is essential

370493 it is an abnormal hike which has never been witnessed in the past the airlines have formed a cartel and there is no monitoring by the government
370494 there is also no regulatory body for the civil aviation sector like trai in telecom the government should call the airlines and take necessary steps to prevent burdening of the people
370495 pradeep will not play tomorrows match and baldeep singh jr would replace him
370496 renedy and surkumar will also be rested and bhutia will be second half substitute
370497 there are three options one you remain at bar a and pay the 30 million which you do not have two you dont pay them and i go to jail or three you go to real madrid

370514 we have had time to recover we have fresh legs
370515 i actually walked around the facility the other day looking for a place i could park it that had shade but there is not one stitch of shade on this whole facility thats all right though i go in at night turn on the ac crank the generator up about 9 oclock come in for a few minutes make a couple phone calls then go back
370516 we finally decided to buy one last year and with the option of either driving all the way to franklin or staying at the hotel neither were the best of options so i chose to bring an rv up here and sleep in it during training camp
370517 it worked out great we get out of meetings at 9 30 10 oclock sometimes its just too late to have to drive all the way back home so i just crash in the rv
370518 im not a sleep in between practice guy anyway i hang out here check my e mails pay bills watch tv read books whatever
370519 i had teammates when i was in training camp share a camper so its been done before i dont see it becoming an epidemic
370520 its not quite an old airstream but its also not a pop up
370521 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
370522 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
370523 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
370524 with that kind of track record sen mccain should be the last person lecturing sen obama about a commitment to quality education for our nations children
370525 i think the united states of america has reached the point where we should provide equal economic opportunity for all americans
370526 that frankly is something that i dont think helps anyone
370527 he handled himself very well given the crowd and his positions
370528 it would have been nice to see him compare and contrast himself less with obama but focus more on his positions
370529 still needs to go to school on affirmative action and the real impact
370530 i do not think this country is in a place where we all have an equal opportunity
370531 i can hear and listen to the passion caring and concern involved that you have expressed so eloquently
370532 i do have an idea what its like to be deprived of your rights
370533 i know the girls theyre going to go crazy when they see it the ladies are gonna go crazy when they see bow wows first sex scene it was with a porn star i dont know her name she probably watching this like what i did a scene with him and he doesnt remember my name nah i dont remember her name but she was bad though she was baaaaad
370534 i was cool i was comfortable with it i was definitely comfortable with it it is what it is normal stuff that happens its crazy cause for me it was normal it was normal but i know when i look back at it when i see it im gonna be like damn look at this this is crazy i stun myself sometimes i cant even front pretend
370535 but since youre such an exceptional beauty im prepared to forgive you
370536 the miracle isnt that i finished the miracle is that i had the courage to start

370539 my biggest concern about this issue is my right to say no
370540 name their kids after food just to have permissible food they are allowed to love in their lives
370541 i am already feeling the disruption and destabilization in my life
370542 police you shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life
370543 peace and security we discovered in south africa do not come through the barrel of a gun i support the boat convoy in its attempt to bring on going humanitarian relief to the people of gaza
370544 we want to break the siege of gaza we want to raise international awareness about the prison like closure of the gaza strip and pressure the international community to review its sanctions policy and end its support for continued israeli occupation we want to uphold palestines right to welcome internationals as visitors human rights observers humanitarian aid workers journalists or otherwise
370545 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet

370552 en somme il tente de sauver son honneur il ny a probablement pas grand chose gagner pour lui dans ce proc s il sadresse un certain public serbe il veut se pr senter en victime
370553 je ne pense pas quil y parviendra holbrooke pourrait tre tent de t moigner pour donner sa version des faits mais je ne pense pas quil le fera si cest karadzic qui le demande
370554 we took her away from home to work before she was due to run in the pretty polly stakes in june and things werent quite 100 with her afterwards
370555 while the problem wasnt a major one she didnt come back the way we had thought she would
370556 as she has been such a great filly we took the decision on friday morning to retire her she will be covered next year
370557 vaughany said something very important to me just before i went out to bat and said dont be reckless but be aggressive and i quite enjoyed having that freedom from the skipper
370558 i was going out there and trying to take the bowlers on which is how i play my best cricket and so it was nice to go out there and try to score from ball one
370559 i wasnt going to change my way from ball one i said i was going to go out there and be aggressive i wanted to go out there and give it a good go
370560 i just wanted to continue in that manner whether i was in the 90s or we were six down and really forget about the situation and just watch the ball and hit it and it worked for me
370561 i havent scored the runs so far in test cricket this year and i was under a lot of pressure
370562 it wasnt pressure so much from the outside but pressure knowing that i had to contribute and feeling as if ive let the team down when i hadnt contributed and thats how its felt over the last few months
370563 it was very special it was one of those days where everything went my way and its certainly a day ill never forget because its been tough over the last couple of months
370564 it simply wasnt good enough and we have got that out of the way in the dressing room we have got a gift in the morning and thats the second new ball and we have to make it work
370565 the game is on a knife edge we asked the guys to forget about outcomes and we actually forgot about everything else we spoke about
370566 both the ecb and kent are bitterly disappointed at this stance as kent had offered various solutions aimed at overcoming the objections of the organisers such as not to include players who had taken part in unauthorised cricket in their squad
370567 the ecb have written to the organisers confirming that subject to contract the board has approved the participation of middlesex the twenty20 cup winners on the proviso that the event is authorised and on agreed terms
370568 early in the week the players were feeling disappointed following the st helens game
370569 but as the week has progressed they have picked themselves up and are now looking forward to a great opportunity to get out there and play again
370570 we are lucky because week in week out we get the chance to go out and show what we can do you dont get the chance to sit around sulking because there is another game to play
370571 the boys are really looking forward to the leeds game
370572 they had the weekend off last week due to the challenge cup they have recharged and we have managed to get one or two little niggles out of the way
370573 while it is an unfortunate circumstance for an olympian to come this far only to lose a coveted position on the olympic team ms hardy is working expediently and agreeably to resolve the situation with as little impact to the us olympic team as possible
370574 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
370575 you cant think of all that youre in competition so you just want to win and youre just focused
370576 you cant think of all those things until its all over when im back home and then ill probably be emotional nathan will obviously be inconsolable
370577 i think nathan knew it was on the cards because he knew i wanted to do other stuff outside of badminton
370578 i wanted to try different things go on to the next stage of my career and life plus weve achieved what weve we wanted to achieve in badminton
370579 for us really the only thing missing is the olympic gold and i feel this is the best chance weve got to get that after that i dont know how committed and motivated i would be to carry on in other tournaments
370580 i dont know what ill do which is quite nerve racking and exciting as well
370581 id love to be involved in sport somehow especially with london 2012 because weve got some great talent maybe mentoring them helping them with what ive learnt in my career and helping them develop as players
370582 but not coaching much as i love our coaches i dont know how they do it they do such a great job but the amount of work they do
370583 its a really really tough but very rewarding job but i dont think its really me
370584 some partnerships have not worked out because they didnt get on
370585 youve got to have that respect youve got to get on youve got to work with people
370586 i know when to stay well clear of him if hes chucking his racket around and he stays well clear of me if im having a strop you just know each other so we both know what to say and not what to say
370587 weve probably annoyed each other in training and tournaments but you have a cooling off period and move on
370588 im taking a break after the games anyway and well deal with that when it comes there isnt a straightforward replacement for gail
370589 its like finding a business partner weve got a massive bunch of 18 23 year olds but theyre not at the world level yet
370590 how i organise myself in my craft business paper work

370599 events voor het volgend seizoen zullen ipv zaterdag op vrijdag plaatsvinden hieronder vind je de agenda voor het volgend seizoen vrijdag 16 november
370600 bekendheid is niet interessant het enige dat ik wil is van het leven genieten en mooie dingen maken
370601 of je nu muziek maakt of huizen bouwt het draait allemaal om cre ren dat is wat ik het liefst doe
370602 ik denk niet dat er geen andere plek is waar ik de rust had kunnen vinden die ik nodig had
370603 het grappige is dat ik de magie van deze plek pas ontdekte lang nadat ik het had gekocht
370604 dat was in 1977 waarschijnlijk ben ik jarenlang veel te druk geweest met andere dingen om de schoonheid ervan in te zien totdat ik een keer buiten zat te eten met wat vrienden uit de muziekbusiness ineens zag ik wat fleming zag ultieme schoonheid
370605 wat wij bieden is understated luxury een plek waar mensen even kunnen ontsnappen aan de gekte van de wereld waarin ze leven dus nee geen gouden kranen maar wel bij elk appartement een rijk begroeide tuin met een buitendouche en bad en uiteraard de mogelijkheid om je op je kamer te laten masseren of een schoonheidsbehandeling te ondergaan even helemaal terug naar de basis dat is de luxe die je op goldeneye vindt daarnaast is er de intimiteit van de omgeving die alle privacy geeft die een mens en al helemaal een ster zich kan wensen
370606 er heerst hier een bijzondere vibe goldeneye trekt gasten aan die op een bepaalde manier in het leven staan vaak zeer creatief en bijzonder talentvol
370607 ik heb lang nagedacht of we het moesten doen maar ben ervan overtuigd dat het een goede stap is natuurlijk zal het drukker worden maar dat betekent niet per definitie een slechte ontwikkeling waar interessante mensen bij elkaar komen kunnen interessante dingen gebeuren en dat is nu al de kracht van het resort
370608 why not just write in a diary or post them privately
370609 oh look im a somewhat attractive girl in a band look at me tra la fucking la
370610 i didnt make you feel that way you made yourself feel that way
370611 i take possession once twice and thrice and all the times i can and must of the actual jurisdiction civil as well as criminal of the lands of the rio del norte the rio grande without exception whatsoever with all its meadows and pasture ground and passes
370612 this possession is to include all other lands pueblos cities villas of whatsoever nature now founded in the kingdom and province and all the neighboring and adjoining lands thereto with all its mountains valleys passes and all its native indians who are now included therein
370613 i take all jurisdiction civil as well as criminal high as well as low from the edge of the mountains to the stones and sand in the rivers and the leaves of the trees
370614 most holy trinity and of the eternal unity deity and majesty god the father the son and the holy ghost three persons in the one and only true god
370615 the most christian king don philip our lord the defender and protector of the holy church and its true son
370616 because it is the will of god that all people in this case the puebloan peoples be saved it is his divine will that his word be carried to all men and that it be obeyed everywhere by everyone
370617 there are other temporal reasons for which i should accomplish this conquest that these peoples may be bettered in commerce and trade gain better ideas of government augment the number of their occupations and learn the arts become tillers of the soil and keep livestock and cattle and learn to live like rational beings
370618 as harsh and humiliating as the systems of forced work and payment were
370619 the continual religious persecution during the years from about 1598 to 1680 was even more galling to the indian people
370620 when their indigenous religion had been suppressed it means that the natural order of life was disrupted
370621 lack of rain in 1640 combined with the destructive apache raid of that year produced widespread famine and 3000 indian fatalities other thousands perished in the drought and famine of 1663 1669
370622 galling problem how long were they to put up with the persecution and exploitation they suffered the consensus was that something had to be done but what the situation of the tribes was grave
370623 that pope was not arrogant but instead was always willing to learn consider advice and to explain his decisions
370624 consumed by hatred possessed by a vision of his land restored to its old way of life hungering for vengeance against those who had bruised his body and oppressed his spirit
370625 they are here on tuesdays and thursdays from 12 to 2 oclock
370626 okay so theyre here tuesday through thursday from 12 to 2 oclock
370627 so youre telling me that they are here from noon to 2

370629 id buy that expensive watch so other people will too
370630 i need to find a product or a service that lots of people want at a price they can easily afford
370631 theyre hoping to fool you into forgetting that money doesnt come from the internet money comes from people
370632 id buy that expensive watch so other people will too
370633 i need to find a product or a service that lots of people want at a price they can easily afford
370634 gather up everything the creation has been doing and to come and present it before god
370635 the more platforms that get added the more complicated dealing with rights gets
370636 by paying closer attention to where you put your content you can control count and monetize the audience in multiple places
370637 to take our live event coverage and put it on multiple video players on multiple sites would be harder to control the quality of that delivery
370638 oh jenny poor jenny dont you want to stay in from the field today you look ever so ill a day off would do you good and of course we would stay in with you for safety
370639 oh boy this is a big one eleven point four centimeters
370640 what is your damage little boy you have a sick and twisted world perspective
370641 it shouldnt happen i mean i think were in america youre in america i think that they should go with our holidays
370642 i think after a few months of legislation we will wonder what all the fuss is about same as when we moved to mandatory recycling
370643 i love that because it does sum me up pretty well i can be very blunt about subjects and not just about my opinions we are talking all the guts literally and glory
370644 hey i drove by the tea room and its packed can we just play pool at your apartment club tonight

370649 im not going to make some faustian deal with you and trade my soul to beat mark at pool
370650 weve only got one soul between us and youre monopolizing it
370651 youre still smarting from that display in the park ive got the confidence to win tonight you dont and you know it
370652 ill play you right now winner takes on mark if he ever gets here
370653 maybe pool isnt your game now get out of here
370654 this isnt over dillon the time is coming when well play on my terms in my realm you dont stand a chance
370655 la riconversione degli impianti di selezione e trattamento dei rifiuti in impianti per il compostaggio e la raccolta differenziata

370664 la campania tecnicamente pulita ma mancano ancora alcuni dati non per colpa nostra
370665 air traffic controllers received a call from the pilot declaring an emergency and proceeded to give priority clearance for a landing at sydney
370666 it was a qantas flight but im not sure if it was a 747 he said
370667 we hope that colleagues will have heard from their constituents that something has to be done and done before congress finishes its business this year
370668 can begin to break the current legislative stalemate on the senate floor
370669 would bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term
370670 we would need to see a bill that would increase the supply here in our own country across the board in a comprehensive way
370671 the fact that theyre uncomfortable means were doing the right thing
370672 ivins would have stood to make tens of thousands of dollars but not millions
370673 it will depend on the business arrangements that are in place
370674 i dont think he ever intended to kill anybody he just wanted to prove look this is possible he probably had no clue that it would aerosolize through those envelopes and kill those postal workers
370675 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
370676 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
370677 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
370678 as a member in al qaeda council shoura the highest executive committee in al qaeda
370679 he was not fit to plan or execute but he is fit to change trucks tires change oil filters wash and clean cars and fasten cargo in pickup trucks
370680 we believe he was in the woods and near our officers who were also in the woods all night
370681 i feel bad about those other people that got killed
370682 theres a saying up here that this is a great place to raise kids
370683 robert has not been contacted by the ethics commission at all so theres really nothing to respond to there
370684 after surveying my options i quickly realized that infrastructure development represents the best new market opportunity for future investment growth
370685 we never seriously considered doing anything except selling until a broker suggested we take the equity out of our existing home buy another house and rent out the old house until the market turns around
370686 when the market really fell out last year we decided to take his advice
370687 about 15 of the national landlord market is new to landlording in the past two years
370688 the value of my home has dropped to 450 000
370689 so ive decided to hang on and lease it out but im having a hard time finding a renter
370690 so it might cost us to rent them now but its worth it to take that loss and make money later down the road
370691 there are tenants out there looking for naive landlords who will rent to them but have no intention of paying the rent
370692 so its incredibly important for landlords to go through the initial procedures of having the tenant fill out an application and go over it with a fine tooth comb
370693 congress shouldnt leave its business unfinished while american wallets are drained at the pump
370694 let us demand that the president of the united states call a special session of this congress on energy
370695 i must have a trillion different passwords for a trillion different web sites
370696 people will absolutely shut off the spending spigots given the soured jobs market
370697 with job losses mounting prices rising increased turbulence in our financial system and a growing credit crunch we need to do more
370698 we cannot afford four more years of the failed bush economic policies and that is what senator mccain is offering
370699 americans are hurting and todays job numbers are just the latest reminder of the economic challenges we face
370700 weve tried to adopt a culture of preservation and educating ourselves said reifschneider a 15 year resident of the notch neighborhood bounded by east speedway east broadway north freeman road and saguaro national park east
370701 we do the best we possibly can to live here with wildlife rather than exclude wildlife from our properties
370702 the only way wildlife can survive in an urban or suburban area is to adjust to people and people have to figure out how to adjust to nature
370703 what im doing is really for the city in all the places that leopard frogs might live in the city backyards parks and ecological restoration sites
370704 for me this is not just a hedge against extinction i just think it would be cool to have a lot of wildlife in tucson
370705 were trying to bring back and maintain some of the habitat so that critters that have managed to hang on with their teeth have a place to be
370706 we want to show that people are really serious about conservation and that it wasnt just a bunch of people saying nimby not in my backyard
370707 there are factors we are evaluating whether there are places that are ready for frogs and whether we have the resources to do it properly
370708 the optimism what people are willing to do to help conserve a species thats not doing that well thats great to see
370709 bullfrogs are like typhoid mary carriers they dont suffer the consequences
370710 if i leave them they stay eat leopard frogs or worse they reproduce
370711 if one bullfrog lays eggs weve got 100 times the problem
370712 not one frog not one tadpole has been moved without documentation without reporting to game and fish
370713 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
370714 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
370715 its a continuation of the trend weve been seeing moderate job declines overall and increases in total unemployment
370716 youre on a plane watching a movie and your iphone goes dead what do you do
370717 there was never a conversation that took place where we did not discuss shareholder value
370718 i want no one to make a mistake about that
370719 we have a very good operating model and we believe our operating model will allow us to accelerate our growth
370720 i think you have overpaid executives overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome on the board
370721 they are a corporation destroying over the hill green tentacled octopus from redmond and my support and my wifes support is with this board and this management team
370722 there may be a few more dollars on the table
370723 i cannot to this day tell you why they did that
370724 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts
370725 a few days ago i met with both jerry yang and roy bostock and i believe both gentlemen genuinely wish that we will be able to work together to enhance value
370726 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
370727 we knew what we needed to do to respond and react
370728 we want to make the flying experience more accessible to the mainstream market
370729 it reinforces the idea that were seeing a steady but not dramatic decline in employment which is likely to last for some time
370730 we play them tomorrow and im looking forward to a great game tomorrow we love playing in tournaments like these
370731 but i cant give you any answer about van der vaart how do you want me to give you the answer when i dont know anything about it
370732 well youll have to ask other people in the chain
370733 these are matters that arent concerning me im only involved with my team and the matches this weekend
370734 and at the moment it seems very fashionable to do those things
370735 its happening all the time in the world of football its almost as if anything goes
370736 but i dont know if you can stop it it would certainly be very difficult
370737 do i think real madrid do it no no i dont feel were guilty of it at all
370738 i like playing with the best and villa is one of those

370741 2080 though their synth electro heavy sound was tight yeasayer frontman anand wilder was a bit sloppy on the vocal side of things
370742 i tell myself hey youve got nothing to lose the thing is with fitch i respect the guy hes actually one of the nicest guys ive met in the ufc and i respect what hes accomplished but heading into that fight people blow things out of proportion hes just a freaking guy he did not invent a new punch that ive never seen i mean does he do a triple somersault coming in is he going to summon the wind no hes just another guy and if hes just another guy i can kick him in the face
370743 to quote royce gracies old line if god doesnt interfere most of the time the better fighter wins what ive seen from bruno is his stand up is okay and hes going to hit hard but i dont think technically speaking hes going to be as good as me thats not a knock on him im just confident that with as many years experience as i have hes going to have a hard time striking with me
370744 hell see if that works but i dont really feel huge threats from his ground and pound i can shut down damage from some of the best guys in the world if hes able to get me down with his terrible single leg kick out im not feeling it for him
370745 you know i was already watching mma and i was a fan but i never thought that i would be able to get involved with it at this high of a level so i started looking for gyms and found out that team quest was in my hometown in portland
370746 i dont consider myself a grammar titian or anything like that
370747 but if you dont want to use the language correctly dont
370748 i dont have to strike but i do because i want to it used to be that kickboxing was my default and i did that because i had to do it i do enough offensive wrestling to get things done but my defensive wrestling is stellar and thats what needs to be better because i want to use it to keep it standing or use my wrestling to get back up
370749 dont get me wrong its mma if bruno lands the thunder he lands the thunder he might buckle my knees but i really do believe im the better fighter

370921 now handicraft items are being produced in amritsar and sold outside the country under kashmir label it is only exporters who thrive on the trade which has proved fatal for kashmiri artisans in particular and kashmir in general
370922 the puppet authorities are falsely rejoicing over the annual export figures of about 1500 crores provided by the indian ministry of commerce when it knew that most of these exports included items produced by other states in india in fact the production in all handcrafts segments has reduced from previous figures if the inflation was taken into account
370923 the artisans who crafted the articles through involvement of their skill and great sense did not even get sufficient money for sustenance not to talk of getting optimum benefit from the job

370953 such projects are profitable though the margins may be lower than what premium get
370954 men are often raised to repress and deny their inner thoughts and fears and learn not to notice them
370955 oh she must have watched oprah today shes asking me crazy love questions
370956 as i write this oprah is on channel 4 one of the mbc channels we get on nilesat showing americans how to get out of debt her guest speaker is telling a studio full of american women who seem to have over shopped that they could probably do with fewer designer products as they talk about increasing incomes and fortunes sabrine al janabi a young iraqi woman is on al jazeera telling how iraqi security forces abducted her from her home and raped her you can only see her eyes her voice is hoarse and it keeps breaking as she speaks in the end she tells the reporter that she cant talk about it anymore and she covers her eyes with shame
370957 i think some of the conspiracy theories going around about how the bush administration used anthrax to push us into war are completely ridiculous
370958 i dont believe the suicide should necessarily lead to the assumption of guilt the weight of a federal investigation and potential career life effects regardless of the outcome could cause a great deal of stress that could cause someone to commit suicide
370959 youre right rick because iraq was such a wonderful place that they wouldnt even think about committing acts of terrorism against the us
370960 soldi avanti venite a me e siate abbondanti da questa sera in poi non saremo pi distanti con laiuto di questa bottiglia venite a me e siate tanti
370961 in feite zijn we sinds de aanstelling van de onderhandelaars niet n millimeter vooruitgegaan
370962 we gaan ons niet laten opjagen ook niet wanneer straks honderden mensen in een bouwkraan kruipen of een hongerstaking beginnen
370963 ik hing drie seconden aan een hek en kreeg daarvoor drie maanden stadionverbod en 250 euro boete dat is toch overdreven
370964 begin februari kreeg ik een brief van de voetbalcel ik kreeg drie maanden stadionverbod en een boete van maar liefst 250 euro ik gedroeg me helemaal niet agressief tegenover de thuissupporters ik was gewoon blij met de goal
370965 met een geldboete kon ik nog leven maar die drie maanden stadionverbod dat nooit ik kom al heel mijn leven jaar naar antwerp kijken ik ben nog nooit in relletjes betrokken geweest en dan zon zware straf was een stadionverbod of een boete alleen niet voldoende
370966 ik wist niet dat ik niet aan een hek mocht hangen in alle stadions wijzen bordjes erop dat het verboden is het veld te betreden pas in de rechtbank hoorde ik dat het hek deel uitmaakt van het veld daar mag je dus niet op
370967 ze liggen al 7 8 jaar in alle supermarkten en in veel nachtwinkels
370968 wij zien geen spectaculaire stijging hier valt het eerder op dat cocktails en schuimwijn weer in zijn
370969 wij houden ons uiteraard aan de wet wij richten bijvoorbeeld geen reclame specifiek op jongeren en schrijven ons vakmanschap drink je met verstand maar we doen ook aan zelfregulering we ontmoedigen de verkoop in automaten wellicht wordt dat binnenkort ook wet
370970 the goal is to be unified take my hand be my brother
370971 i feel angry i feel helpless want to change the world yeah
370972 peanut butter jelly peanut butter jelly peanut butter jelly with a baseball bat
370973 we all live under the reign did you know of one king
370974 there are two kinds of people in the world those who love chocolate and communists
370975 we were surprised when we ended up arresting these two
370976 i am a nobody i am a small rope a tiny ladder the tail end a leaf
370977 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules
370978 the feature article in the catholic press developing ideas and contacting editors
370979 love is a matter of the will if you will to love someone even the most repulsive and wicked and try to serve him as an expression of that love then you soon come to feel the love
370980 thinking gloomily of the sins and shortcomings of others and it suddenly came to me to remember my own offenses just as heinous as those of others if i concern myself with my own sins and lament them if i remember my own failures and lapses i will not be resentful of others this was most cheering and lifted the load of gloom from my mind it makes one unhappy to judge people and happy to love them
370981 as i came down the street a well dressed priest drove by in a big car then i passed another also well dressed comfortable then still another out in front of a most luxurious mansion the parish house playing with a dog on a leash all of them well fed well housed comfortable caring for the safe people like themselves and where are the priests for the poor the down and out the sick in city hospitals in jails it is the little of gods children who do not get cared for god help them and god help the priest who is caught in the bourgeois system and cannot get out
370982 love in practice is a harsh and dreadful thing compared to love in dreams
370983 a sad world we are surrounded by sadness one must will to rejoice
370984 oh the cleavage between priest and people the comfortable and the destitute
370985 to love our brother because jesus son of god gave us a picture of that love in the story of the prodigal son that is the kind of father we have no judgment there only the madness of love deep profound as profligate in its way as the sons tawdry loves had been profligate
370986 o god give me the grace ever to alleviate the crosses of those around me never to add to them
370987 i will tell you personally over and over o god i love you i adore you i worship you make me mean it in my life make me show it in my choices make me show it from my waking thought to my sleeping
370988 i speak and write so much better than i perform but we can never lower the ideal because we fail in living up to it
370989 god wishes us to feel his immanence he is near as teh breath we draw we have him present in the blessed sacrament of the altar and if our faith were as a grain of mustard seed we would be prostrate as we entered his presence we take his presence so much for granted
370990 i couldnt believe the injustice that was happening to him
370991 family attorney rick alexander said delafields death could have been prevented and that there are four things that jump out at him about the case
370992 one shes in a wheelchair two shes schizophrenic three theyre using a taser on a person thats in a wheelchair and then four is that they tasered her 10 times for a period of like two minutes
370993 intentionally inflicting suffering on another person in order to coerce or intimidate them
370994 taser torture abuse murder and denial of basic human rights
370995 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
370996 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
370997 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
370998 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
370999 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
371000 vorig jaar hebben we daardoor voor 36 miljoen dollar aan opdrachten moeten laten lopen
371001 de binnenkomende schepen zijn gemiddeld wel groter en daardoor is ook meer assistentie nodig
371002 maar de taart is groter we kregen ook tachtig verzoeken binnen daar konden we niets mee doen omdat er geen sleper beschikbaar was
371003 we zijn al gestart met werving en upgrading van de bemanning voor de mero we hopen ongeveer 25 extra banen te kunnen cre ren in de komende twee jaar
371004 als ze langer dan acht dagen van huis moeten zeggen ze dat ze hun vrouw verliezen
371005 we proberen het ze natuurlijk wel zoveel mogelijk naar de zin te maken ze hebben een stem bij de inkoop van proviand en films
371006 in de afgelopen vier jaar zijn de brandstofkosten met 330 procent gestegen die prijsstijgingen berekenen we nu door in onze nieuwe tarieven desondanks blijven we de goedkoopste aanbieder in de regio
371007 op de lokale markt draaien we voornamelijk op tankers vracht en cruiseschepen kunnen op eigen kracht aanmeren onze tarieven zijn dus niet van invloed op de prijs van een zak rijst in de supermarkt
371008 well you better eat your carrots and broccoli so you can grow big and tall
371009 my son better not get used to slidin down that pole
371010 vorig jaar hebben we daardoor voor 36 miljoen dollar aan opdrachten moeten laten lopen
371011 de binnenkomende schepen zijn gemiddeld wel groter en daardoor is ook meer assistentie nodig

371017 yeah im on my way round have you got it
371018 we now believe that patrick slider is attempting to avoid an upcoming trial on multiple felonies in washington county while there is still a chance that something has happened to patrick slider the investigation is leading us to believe he has tried to fake his disappearance to avoid prosecution in ohio
371019 just dont go into debt too fast and never let yourselves get used to two incomes thats a big thing
371020 my wife makes our own pizza and we can buy a better quality ground beef at the grocery store than we would eat at a fast food restaurant
371021 purchasing in large quantities is a better value for me and i dont have to go to the store as often which also saves gas
371022 the older boys require more in the way of clothing than the younger children because the knees on their pants tend to wear quicker
371023 infants and toddlers dont wear out their clothing as quickly and much of it can be passed down to the next child
371024 shari is our accountant and she is pretty good at it
371025 we arent making hundreds of thousands of dollars but we have never gone into the hole
371026 we usually get around 7 000 or 8 000 people
371027 the only time its ever been down is because of the weather
371028 when the weather is bad people generally dont want to come out to the fair
371029 there is no doubt that fairs all across the state are struggling and theyre struggling in washington county as well
371030 we try to do what we can to get people in
371031 with fuel costs today it might keep people at home over the summer
371032 if they need something to do they might go to the county fair its a plus if you dont have to drive out of the county to have something to do
371033 we have a 4 h hog show there are some 4 h shows here and some at barlow there are only three fairs but i dont see any competition
371034 its about 10 for two hours of entertainment well you can come to the fair and spend 8 and spend the whole day
371035 turkey gets most of its gas 68 of 2008 demand of 38 billion cubic metres bcm from russias gazprom under three long term deals
371036 between 1940 and 1945 sixty one german cities with a total population of 25 millions were destroyed or devastated in a bombing campaign initiated by the british government destruction on this scale had no other purpose than the indiscriminate mass murder of as many german people as possible quite regardless of their civilian status it led to retaliatory bombing resulting in 60 000 british dead and 86 000 injured
371037 it can be hard to part with some of it but if its just going to be kept in boxes whats the point
371038 everyone seems happy and everyone says theyre coming back next year so there will be a next year
371039 i came to the show for the first time last year and i was overwhelmed
371040 i like to paint vintage fenton glass using a different style a unique style
371041 i dont use any templates its all one of a kind
371042 for me my youngest girl age 1 is in pull ups and shes always pulling them off which wastes them i spend lots of money on disposable diapers
371043 overall cost was not a part of our concern when i knew another child was coming
371044 college savings is a huge deal for us and that was something we thought about
371045 we try to be careful with budgeting in general but i dont think many people actually consider the cost of raising a child when they get pregnant
371046 more people than ever before are asking how to grow their own food and a large number of people came to our last seminar on canning and food preservation
371047 if you present ideas in a positive way with a good attitude it works a lot better
371048 my kids love to go to mcdonalds but that gets expensive and i try to discourage it their dad takes them
371049 the cost of everything gas groceries utilities everything is going up
371050 theres a new store in marietta and i expect well find some great things my older guys are starting to be fashion conscious so theyll have their eye out for all the name brands
371051 the kids have a great time anywhere just being with mom and dad is special
371052 were going to have kids but we want to pay down debt and get a little more stable financially
371053 its not so much the cost of kids we just are enjoying hanging out together being able to get up and go when we want
371054 if we act boldly then our economy will be less vulnerable to economic disruption our trade balance will improve the pace of u s technological innovation will accelerate and the american worker will be in a stronger position to adapt to the global economy
371055 investments in all these three key areas education science and technology and energy would go a long way in making america more competitive
371056 but while the means we use to accomplish these ends should be subject to vigorous and open debate the ends themselves shouldnt be in dispute
371057 like those before us we should be asking ourselves what mix of policies will lead to a dynamic free market and widespread economic security entrepreneurial innovation and upwards mobility
371058 that we will do collectively through our government only those things that we cannot do well or at all individually and privately
371059 our greatest asset has been our system of social organization a system that for generations has encouraged constant innovation individual initiative and the efficient allocation of resources
371060 identify those reforms that have the highest impact on student achievement fund them adequately and eliminate those programs that dont produce results
371061 if we want an innovation economy one that generates more googles each year then we have to invest in our future innovators by doubling federal funding of basic research over the next five years training one hundred thousand more engineers and scientists over the next four years or providing new research grants to the most outstanding early career researchers in the country
371062 we should end every single tax break the industry currently receives and demand that 1 percent of the revenues from oil companies with over 1 billion in quarterly profits go toward financing alternative energy research and the necessary infrastructure
371063 obama touts brazil as a good example where a mix of regulation and direct government investment has developed a highly efficient biofuel industry and 70 percent of new vehicles run on sugar based ethanol instead of gasoline
371064 in exchange for federal assistance in meeting the health care costs of retired autoworkers the big three would reinvest these savings into developing more fuel efficient vehicles
371065 some of that wealth rich people has to be plowed back into education so that the next generation has a fair chance and to maintain our infrastructure and provide some sort of safety net for those who lose out in a market economy
371066 change in spirit a willingness to put our common interests and the interests of future generations ahead of short term expediency

371086 rekaman asli di knkt tersimpan dalam boks tertutup bersifat rahasia dan dalam bentuk pita yang beredar itu tidak asli dan tidak original

371100 i actually tried to expose them way back in february to newspapers and also to the beijing olympics committee
371101 it seems like no one took it seriously until now
371102 if i failed to recognize this internet scam very few other individuals with less of an e commerce background would have had a chance
371103 so i can empathize with others in the same position
371104 ive been in business for 18 years im aware that theres fraud out there
371105 but they looked so legitimate their website was so elaborate
371106 i work for a fairly large software company and the team i manage is responsible for dealing with internet crime
371107 so it was quite amusing to everyone at work that i had been scammed on the internet
371108 the important point im making by talking about this is that this was a bloody good scam
371109 its like one of those boiler room deals in the stock market the huge office and all these people and at the last second they simply shut it down
371110 ive got good democrats coming up to me saying bill weve got problems with your friend
371111 how well barack will go over here in the fall
371112 does he have the capacity to do well compared to the historical marker for past democratic candidates in those areas we think so
371113 they think im like minded like them and theyll just volunteer straight out how they cant see voting for a black man
371114 they are healthier and break down in the body more easily
371115 our message is that people should cut down on both
371116 we have been very concerned about the misunderstanding of our product in the marketplace and want to provide the facts so that consumers can make their choices based on science rather than urban myth hfcs and sugar are treated by the body the same they contain the same calories and nutritionally are no different
371117 it has a crisper flavor not as cloying i think it is a better flavored drink
371118 theres just a lot more awareness about high fructose corn syrup among the public and once people taste a soda flavored with cane sugar they like it better
371119 ivins would have stood to make tens of thousands of dollars but not millions
371120 it will depend on the business arrangements that are in place
371121 i dont think he ever intended to kill anybody he just wanted to prove look this is possible he probably had no clue that it would aerosolize through those envelopes and kill those postal workers

371137 were going back and forth on whether it should be the native sycamore or a bottle tree
371138 look fine in the summer but they are barren in the winter which doesnt look good
371139 the shaws should be required to replace the trees they destroyed with trees of roughly the same size as the ones that were there

371170 i had a very good friendship relationship developed with a friend we shared daily thoughts and ideas she really was a reflection of many of my many good qualities in fact i have never met a person more in tune with how i feel and think
371171 well throughout our conversation she would talk as much and sometimes even more than i
371172 one day she wrote a very very thoughtful note about why she liked talking to me everyday
371173 you sure dont learn anything when you keep your mouth open
371174 unwittingly i believe at least she took the meaning of the phrase to say
371175 the long and short of it our really great conversations died right there and then

371182 the corporate fat cats at these big oil companies are already earning record profits they dont need our tax dollars too there are far smarter places to use this money including bringing down energy costs by investing in the clean power sources of the future such as wind and solar
371183 congress can and should end these subsidies and invest this money in promoting affordable clean energy instead

371195 it is because you only want to hear what others say so you can craft your own
371196 why me why now why is everything happening at once will things get better

371198 how come those old people cant die in their old house
371199 basically the hot dry conditions are going to continue into the night and redevelop tomorrow
371200 theres not going to be much rain its just going to be strong dry winds and lightning will also be part of the equation
371201 welcome to free helpdesk for those who wanna study in oz
371202 its horrible its not stopping why is this happening to us
371203 these are all family members we knew not someone we hadnt seen in a while
371204 the winters fire took out that mountain and went on for 20 miles
371205 just the rapidity with which the landscape has changed is unbelievable
371206 the best quality price and selection of medical marijuana on the westside
371207 like literally an episode of 24 when they bust in on a terrorist cell
371208 im not sure what to make of it all right now
371209 its been like a hidden sanctuary in the chaos of los angeles
371210 our clientele is not sketchy people its cancer patients hippie types people you wouldnt expect to go in there business sort of people our security guard isnt even armed
371211 the one thing we care about is when it is finished it looks good people from the whole world come up here to look at the hollywood sign
371212 it was a big disaster our view of it was the worst we looked right down at it
371213 that tree was stripped it was horrifying looked like a totem pole people thought we did it but we didnt
371214 were going back and forth on whether it should be the native sycamore or a bottle tree
371215 look fine in the summer but they are barren in the winter which doesnt look good
371216 the shaws should be required to replace the trees they destroyed with trees of roughly the same size as the ones that were there
371217 scenes like this you can see all over southern california
371218 we can go to places that are invasive grasslands now that are missing a lot of species
371219 i will continue on and with greater commitment i have a task to do and im going to do it
371220 after witnessing that we felt the crusade was not in jeopardy and that it was only going to be strengthened by what happened
371221 its usually a pretty full event but i imagine this year it will be even more full if such a thing is possible
371222 finding faith the spiritual quest of the post boomer generation
371223 people are going to want to come and hear what he says
371224 i think theres a resonance there that hell be able to tap into between his recent family experience and evangelical theology i miss chris i love him but i know where he is in heaven
371225 i think it will be particularly poignant that greg will be able to stand up and realize that those people were in those seats because they were given an invitation that chris had designed
371226 life is brief and can be taken from us at any moment
371227 around southern california hes ubiquitous hes a regional star with appeal
371228 to not acknowledge it will be almost to dishonor christophers life and his role in the crusade
371229 sure that would always cross our mind when we think about it
371230 but then we have to go back and ask ourselves what would chris want done this is what his life was about helping communicate this message
371231 played the race card from the bottom of the deck
371232 i have many more stories to tell many more scripts to pitch
371233 is a new outreach from family life center international through an online community conferences publications and radio shows they seek to encourage and equip the next generation to answer the call of christ the site provides in depth information on all of these avenues of outreach as well as many online resources the articles deal with topics important to youth and the online community is vibrant of special note is a detailed list of positive christian music alternatives to secular artists which is indexed both by type of music and specific artists this is an excellent outreach from an excellent catholic organization

371238 i am delighted to introduce the taste of ulster guide 2007 2008 today
371239 the vision of taste of ulster is to develop and praise excellence in local cuisine in local cuisine and hospitality
371240 our aim is to promote good restaurants hotels and other eating places as well as quality producers who we believe offer great local food service and authentic innovative ulster cooking
371241 members sign up to a charter asking them to source as much as possible local foods and through the guide consumers can be confident of what they are being served when they sit down to a meal anywhere in northern ireland
371242 members have a sense of identity and belonging this shows locals and visitors what they care about and that they are serious about sourcing locally
371243 with the rebirth of devolved government we can have a say in local food and drink affairs
371244 agriculture and food and drink enterprise is a huge part of northern irelands economy and its vital that we make it the very best we can
371245 we have this great image that we can sell and we need to be up there selling at the top of the market making the best produce and products that we can

371248 if you are a christian there can be no naked autonomy in communion it s an oxymoron a contradiction in terms maybe it s saying the
371249 i would encourage everyone to come along to the pride march whether theyre gay or straight young or old alone or with their families
371250 pride is a carnival style fun day out but this year it takes on an added importance due to the homophobic comments of iris robinson and others in the dup
371251 a record turnout at pride will show the world and our own political leaders that northern ireland really has moved on that we are a society that embraces diversity and celebrates difference it will make belfast pride an event we can all be proud of
371252 we would see hope in our last day inside this dying world for there is still beauty inside this dying world
371253 are you the one they talk about so much going to college
371254 its very very helpful to have a student in the class who along with me remembers lyndon johnson and his presidency who remembers nixon who remembers jimmy carter
371255 younger students have read about and heard about it but they havent lived through those administrations and all the things that occurred then joann offers a very welcome perspective shes lived long enough to see a great deal
371256 i dont have that many more years to live and i want to do good for humanity while im here
371257 in 1996 my fuel costs were in the 17 000 to 18 00 range and next year ive got figures put together that it is going to increase to about 73 000
371258 isnt that frightening and the majority of my cost increase has been in the last three years
371259 this is as close to a potential crisis as it can be
371260 michelle kissed spike with a closed mouth on the corner of his lips there was definitely a bit of caressing going on she was clutching his arm the body language was very romantic
371261 we have to move forward to the nsg we are going to keep this momentum up
371262 the countries acknowledge indias requirements and legitimacy of india asking for access to nuclear energy and they seem to acknowledge that this is in their benefit
371263 we have to move forward to the nsg we are going to keep this momentum up
371264 the countries acknowledge indias requirements and legitimacy of india asking for access to nuclear energy and they seem to acknowledge that this is in their benefit
371265 my image has always been more serious than my sister riya who fits into a more popular and glamorous image i may have bagged a lot of critical acclaim in the past but its she who has a wider mass appeal
371266 i have somehow been paired against older heroes like prosenjit in chokker bali and suniel shetty in dus i was keen to act opposite a younger hero and being able to experiment with a new medium like comedy with a young veteran like tusshar is a great learning experience as for the rumours every time one of my films is slated to release im paired against my hero it started with abhay deol in manorama six feet under and now its tusshar the rumour mills havent even spared my co star randeep hooda from my upcoming film mere khwaabo mein jo aaye me and tusshar dont even hang out together and as for randeep even after 45 days of shooting together we havent exchanged phone numbers
371267 veteran actor paresh rawal had once told me for every one good film you are allowed to do three average films
371268 i didnt consciously decide to only do arty movies it was making the best choices from the scripts i was being offered being in the industry has been a long journey and ive really learnt a lot i think graduating from a second lead to solo performances has made me wiser
371269 it was like carrying the weight of extra baggage but i think working in bengali films like chokkher bali bong connection khela nishi japon directed by sandip ray son of satyajit ray and anuronon ive carved a niche of my own and with multiplexes increasing the popularity of new age bengali cinema im part of the new wave creating a stir in the east
371270 i think the dearth of bollywood celebs in the capital leads to undue sensationalism we were just having a great deal of fun at manavs party things were blown out of proportion yuvraj and i hang out together a lot in mumbai hes even come to my house and met my folks hes a buddy and theres no other attraction between us if there were any sparks between us id be seeing him a long while ago hes just not my type
371271 i like charming men with a good sense of humour yuvraj is all that but hes not my guy as for salman riya and he know each other but you cant call it a deep friendship they exchange a line once in two months or so thats all being in showbiz youre used to the talk
371272 my mother says its an asset if youre drop dead glamorous as well as someone with acting skills

371274 whatever happened in boston is in the past im excited man i cant wait i feel like i took 5 000 pounds off my back
371275 its just a new chapter in my life im happy to be here thats all i can say l a s a great city im happy to be a dodger
371276 i want to say something from the bottom of my heart
371277 i want to thank the fans in boston i love you guys i just want to move on im thinking blue right now im thinking about the dodgers i want people to judge me on what i do here not what i did in boston
371278 clean it up a little bit and make it manageable
371279 ive got to cut it im going to be looking like a baby
371280 i dont want them to treat me different than the other guys if they want me to cut it ill cut it it will grow back
371281 if you could im pretty sure a lot of things people have done would have been turned around
371282 it wouldnt hurt my feelings if they said youre going to start the rest of the year
371283 i dont know that itll be next week or whatever but i think well see him in the near future
371284 you know basically when youre just playing catch you are shutting it down
371285 to this point its been almost a month and the only thing hes done is play soft catch in the cage for all intents and purposes that has been shut down
371286 but we want to make sure hes going to be able to throw later in the year and next year
371287 im just comfortable getting the opportunity to play every day
371288 we were told last year he had kind of a tender elbow
371289 rather than let it be a chronic thing we want to let it calm down
371290 watching him throw the last few weeks i commented to a couple of coaches you know i wonder if his arm is sore because hes bounced a few balls over to first base you know when hes right hes firing it over there
371291 hes thinking he could swing but hes not real comfortable with throwing
371292 im all right now but well find out tomorrow morning
371293 i hit it ok but you never know until you dont see it anymore
371294 it is comforting to some extent that i have other things i can fall back on because of my education but my dream to make it to the major leagues is as big as anyone elses
371295 i dont want to diminish how committed i am and how hard i am working to achieving that
371296 last season was one of struggle and perseverance and i have to be honest its not fun when youre going through it
371297 i tried to manufacture confidence but i am a cerebral player and i knew i was faking it
371298 the mariners made it clear to me that it was not a negative thing
371299 the coaches here have created a very good environment with which to succeed
371300 if someone needs a helping hand i want to be there
371301 and if someone needs to be encouraged i want to be there to pick them up
371302 chris had a big impact on our program for two or three years after he left
371303 the way he practiced the way he carried himself he passed that along to the younger guys he was very humble didnt go around acting like hey im going to stanford all of the players really respected him and looked up to him
371304 you would see him make a great play in a game and what you might not know is that he made that play every game
371305 and we werent surprised because we had seen him make that same great play 50 times in practice he practiced just as hard as he played in games
371306 it would be hard to find an adult who was as dedicated to one thing as chris was to everything whether it was baseball academics his friends or whatever he is just a great all around person who just happens to play baseball
371307 the key for me is that i got very good at time management
371308 i never missed class and i got to know my professors well one of the keys was i learned what not to study and what was really important
371309 when i got into the graduate program i just wanted to stay another year
371310 the rhodes scholarship was nondeferrable and i would have had to start that september 2006
371311 i am very proud of what chris has accomplished in baseball and excited about what the future holds for him
371312 but i am more proud of what he has achieved academically and the type of person he has become
371313 can play the middle of the diamond and has a little sock
371314 i am not in peoples face with religion but i try to plant little seeds
371315 those seeds may not be reaped tomorrow or even next year but maybe five years from now
371316 education is a companion which no future can depress no crime can destroy no enemy can alienate it and no nepotism can enslave

371318 right house right place right time community and lifestyle preferences of the 45 housing market
371319 any hope that plaintiffs could renew their season tickets left with them
371320 neither the city of seattle nor the nba are parties here but plaintiffs claim a right to have this court drag the team and the nba back for two more years of games plaintiffs dont intend to buy tickets for or attend at a venue the team no longer has a right to use
371321 this is absurd no such contract right exists and plaintiffs claim for injunctive relief must be dismissed
371322 at no time during the conversation did i threaten mr schultz in any way either expressly or implicitly regarding his continuation of this lawsuit or any other matter
371323 you dont wave red flags in this environment unless youre extremely frustrated and unless you dont think youre giving patients what they deserve
371324 these are womens lives were talking about it will affect entire families if these women dont get the treatment they need
371325 we wish the waiting lists werent like this so we dont have to make those god like decisions
371326 a slap in the face and a kick in the teeth
371327 we would not be leaving if only the problems we outlined had been heard and addressed in some way
371328 this is not crying wolf what does one do to have to capture the attention of the people who are supposed to deal with these issues what tactics are there it was truly done knowing how final it is
371329 they really have a very luxurious situation in that they have three extremely well trained very competent individuals who are really committed to this line of work
371330 im just not sure that the minister realizes what quality he has out there
371331 i nearly fell over when i read that in the paper
371332 the specialists in this area are so scarce across that country that i dont know where the minister of health in newfoundland thinks hes going to find the capacity to transfer these women into
371333 the outcome is poor these women are living under enormous burden the treatments are difficult to suggest that they now have to go somewhere else and have them is just unacceptable
371334 i dont know what id do without her i dont know if id be here without her
371335 the thought of her leaving is extremely upsetting its extremely upsetting for women in this province in general
371336 but i do understand where theyre coming from if there is a discrepancy why shouldnt they receive the same as the other specialists
371337 hiring and retaining health professionals including physicians falls under the purview of the provinces and territories
371338 we could not take extra patients our wait times now are pretty maxed out were at capacity now
371339 when that happens on the field usually guys have helmets on
371340 but this happened on the sidelines so it probably wasnt a good idea
371341 he was trying to apologize so i was walking with him just to be there
371342 i dont anticipate this having any lingering effect on this team
371343 we were talked to and things were squashed thats it thats the way it is it happened there will be no retaliation by anybody on anything when you look at the schedule we dont play the panthers this year so we need to be smart when were out there
371344 obviously everybody is going to be waiting to see what the repercussions are from this event
371345 im just praying that we rally together as a team because obviously theres going to be some adversity here the focus is not where it needs to be right now
371346 im hoping we can all come together as a team as a family and are able to put this behind us
371347 i think your site one of the better sites ive seen cuz some just want to sell post the stuff up by default no effort one
371348 6 merrvally s e nh n shore 60 card set 5
371349 fundamentally this shows a lack of responsibility on a number of peoples part including chamber personnel and management at the exchange
371350 i will have to reevaluate a post chamber bowl celebration next year
371351 given the seriousness of the issues youd think wed be havng a serious debate but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears i mean i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with is that really what this elections about
371352 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
371353 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
371354 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
371355 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
371356 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
371357 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
371358 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
371359 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
371360 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
371361 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
371362 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
371363 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
371364 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
371365 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
371366 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
371367 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
371368 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
371369 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
371370 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
371371 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
371372 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
371373 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
371374 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
371375 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
371376 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
371377 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
371378 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

371390 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
371391 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
371392 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
371393 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
371394 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
371395 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
371396 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
371397 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
371398 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
371399 telefonate scontate fino al 50 per tutti i nuovi clienti che si attivano entro il 7 settembre 2008
371400 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
371401 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
371402 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
371403 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
371404 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
371405 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
371406 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
371407 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
371408 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
371409 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
371410 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
371411 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
371412 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
371413 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
371414 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
371415 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
371416 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
371417 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
371418 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
371419 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
371420 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
371421 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
371422 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
371423 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
371424 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
371425 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
371426 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
371427 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight

371435 were being inundated with as many as a dozen pelicans a day
371436 we believe its because pelicans have done well this year and produced lots of young
371437 the high number of ailing birds is actually a good sign
371438 a lot of these birds are basically starving to death
371439 after three months of being fed in their breeding colonies this years young pelicans are beginning to disperse from their nests with enough baby fat to tide them over for a few months while they learn to fish
371440 use up all that baby fat thats when they start showing up at rehabilitation centers
371441 will they survive after we let them go hard to say
371442 but i do know this we are giving these birds a second chance to get back in the wild and figure it all out
371443 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future

371489 dit was wat mij betreft de belangrijkste wedstrijd van het seizoen bij winst hadden we op gelijke hoogte kunnen komen en daarmee op redelijk veilige afstand van de degradatieplek dan is het niet leuk om te moeten constateren dat twee van je basiskrachten pim de jong en iris wichems ontbreken vanwege vakantie daarnaast moest ik ook loes de canne gescheurde enkelbanden missen thomas kruijff werd opgezadeld met drie nieuwe gezichten in zijn vak dat was het eerste kwartier ondanks de voorsprong even wennen
371490 in plaats van door te drukken lieten we dkv victoria weer in de wedstrijd komen met een ruststand van 6 6 was alles in principe nog mogelijk we kwamen met 7 9 achter via 8 9 werd het 8 10 op dat moment bracht ik niels mekking hij zorgde voor 9 10 met nog vijf minuten op de klok en een verdediging die stond als een huis zette ik joker abe reurings in een jongen die vaak iets weet te forceren zijn schot voor 10 10 was goed maar helaas viel die net niet door de korf toch een grote pluim voor mijn invallers naast niels en abe kweten ook robbert van spronsen en tessa van swieten zich uitstekend van hun taak het ontbrak in deze wedstrijd aan scorend vermogen de normale schutters waren niet in goeden doen onze invallers tekenden voor vijf scores ook verdedigend stonden ze hun mannetje we verzuimden door te drukken dat viel voor een deel op te hangen aan het ontbreken van de automatismen mensen die zomaar weg gaan extreem veel dit jaar dat zal een stevig agendapunt worden de komende tijd

371515 my elder sister and mother were planning to go to the market the weather was changing color rapidly it was sunshine at this moment and completely cloudy the next moment i told them to decide and better leave as they see the hint of sunshine they leave carrying their umbrellas then i start my conversation with her she seems to have joined tcs i am not sure i was chatting with her about something and then it starts raining like never before the earlier moment i was at home and the next moment i am at office i go near the window to check out the rain and see that its raining very very heavily the clouds have descended on earth and look like inverted cones with various hues it was just like the tornadoes that they show in movies there was not one but many such inverted cones of clouds all bringing in heavy rain i was concerned as my elder sister and mother had taken only an umbrella and then i get up

371529 ashok leylands 1qfy09 numbers were slightly below our expectations while the net sales at 18 8 billion 16 2 yoy growth was ahead of our estimates adjusted ebidta at rs 1 5 billion 2 3 yoy decline was below our estimates ebidta margins adjusted for forex gain loss declined by 150 bps to 8 0 adjusted net profits of rs 781 million 2 yoy growth was below our expectations the underperformance in 1qfy09 was primarily due to significant increase in raw material costs the management has indicated that with the last round of price hike in june 2008 around 3 5 the company is adequately covered for cost pressures on the raw material front and expects the pressure on operating margins to subsidize in the coming quarters however further commodity price increase would require pricing actions
371530 we have revised our fy09 and fy10 eps estimates by 9 and 6 to rs 3 7 and rs 4 2 respectively we have revised our target price to rs 38 at rs 38 the stock would trade at per of 10 2 times and 9 times respectively on ev ebidta basis the stock would trade at 4 5 times and 3 7 times our fy09 and fy10 estimates we maintain our buy on the stock

371535 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
371536 were probably holding around 3 000 people you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
371537 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
371538 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
371539 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003
371540 the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
371541 the us may also have kept prisoners on ships within diego garcias territorial waters a contention the us has long denied
371542 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
371543 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the us did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
371544 is a violation of uk law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
371545 a us plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the us facility in diego garcia the detainees did not leave the plane and the us government has assured us that no us detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
371546 neither of the two detainees carried aboard the rendition flights that refuelled at diego garcia was ever part of the cias high value terrorist interrogation program
371547 the united states government confirmed that with the exception of two cases related to diego garcia in 2002 there have been no other instances in which us intelligence flights landed in the united kingdom our overseas territories or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 september 2001
371548 intentionally failed to ask the right questions of the us and accepted implausible us assurances at face value
371549 this remains a transatlantic cover up of epic proportions while the british government seems content to accept whatever nonsense it is fed by its us allies the sordid truth about diego garcias central role in the unjust rendition and detention of prisoners in the so called war on terror cannot be hidden forever
371550 it is deplorable that previous us assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false the failure of the united states administration to tell the truth resulted in the uk government inadvertently misleading our select committee and the house of commons we intend to examine further the extent of uk supervision of us activities on diego garcia including all flights and ships serviced from diego garcia
371551 responsible for the 9 11 operation from a to z
371552 diego garcia is an obvious place for a secret facility they want somewhere thats difficult to escape from difficult to attack not visible to prying eyes and where a lot of other activity is going on diego garcia is ideal

371559 but the company has to make some difficult decisions and we think weve done it in a way that strikes a balance between meeting the needs of retirees and what it will take to make sure kodak remains competitive
371560 a lot of industry has been looking for creative ways to solve these issues but they cant get a handle on it
371561 its a very tough situation employers are in and we constantly are hearing from folks particularly the boomer generation that people will be working past the traditional retirement age whether for finances or for access to benefits

371568 abg shipyard reported disappointing results in q1fy09 despite this we maintain our earnings estimates for fy09e and fy10e in light of gain in inventory of rs 1 9 billion and vessels not achieving the threshold levels of billing during q1fy09

371587 i think that the younger generation thinks all they have to do is get on tv and act a bit crazy and things will happen for them
371588 theyve got it wrong because you need to have a talent to get really famous
371589 lindsay is so natural at what she does ive never seen one take where shes off the difference between her and the other girls that are naughty in the business is that shes actually talented its not like and the rest of them we took the chance its good that we did

371591 i think more parents are both working and hypertasking more
371592 kids are rewarded more and part of that reward is toys end up everywhere it seems that the more successful parents are the more toys are cluttering the home toys used to be just upstairs now they are upstairs and downstairs i think parents feel as guilty about working as hard as they do
371593 you cant get mad at the kids if you dont supervise them
371594 if you see kids taking over lots of the area they are in charge of the family and thats not the way it should be
371595 each evening they should spend 15 minutes to police the area
371596 say something like thank you for picking up your shoes that really helps me soon the kids will be picking up after themselves without you having to ask them to do it
371597 when kids get older they are often not fond of sharing the space with siblings
371598 the blame game starts about who didnt put what away name tags color coding or distinct cabinets separate the space for accountability
371599 why should he get a plea bargain for what he did to her

371602 were trying to save the victims to come so to speak
371603 and were trying to let her memory serve as a purpose
371604 so what it can do is bring attention to other situations and i do appreciate that
371605 it has nothing to do with the homeowners nobody has any claim on their homes
371606 i said whats going on i know i paid my mortgage
371607 my biggest concern is i am going to be held liable and have to pay for this on top of my mortgage and bills
371608 we will do what we can to ease their concerns the problem is ours
371609 being first time home buyers we shouldnt be in this situation
371610 i dont think its fair to us who scrimped and saved to pay our mortgage
371611 what it will do is allow us to capitalize on some of the things that the city already has in place
371612 we have better highways we have the zoo a pottery festival that draws people to our area we need to capitalize on that and make the most of it
371613 about three quarters of a million people come to the zoo every year
371614 when they do they tend to spend roundabout 40 to 45 dollars a day somewhere between 50 to 60 million dollars a year spins off into the local economy meals gas some hotels and some other retail
371615 to do the zoo properly you really need to be here for at least a day and a half
371616 if you can encourage people to stay the night their spending goes to about 145 a day
371617 this area has a real need for a good four star hotel and more three star hotels
371618 with that comes the real opportunity for a convention center here as well
371619 the idea has been out there for quite some time
371620 but partly because of the alcohol business we havent been able to move that forward
371621 the unwritten rule is never go into the gorge alone
371622 something like that gives you an appreciation for the human spirit and what people can do when they are given a choice to live or die
371623 i will have to have surgery and i expect to make a full recovery
371624 its a contributing factor but it is not the lone factor
371625 i dont know whats coming out of south carolina but the state is being rather aggressive
371626 and we want to be in an area with enough population to provide staff and we want to be in close proximity to local customers
371627 apparently someone going over the books realized there was some money missing and they reported it to their supervisors
371628 the fuel costs are going to be a huge issue for people on fixed income of low and moderate means
371629 i for one will hear a lot of sighs of relief if it can reach out particularly to those who dont get help
371630 the sooner we address what we all know will be very tough times for so many people this winter the better
371631 id love to see the dollars come with flexibility versus saying use it for oil or you dont get it at all
371632 she does in this case support sticking to the portion of the call everyone agrees on
371633 when you put a driver in a truck making 15 to 20 an hour and youre talking diesel at 5 a gallon you want to maximize those deliveries
371634 when you make a stop at a house you want those to be the largest deliveries possible and i dont know if the average person has a tremendous benefit of a 25 gallon reduction
371635 the superintendent shall not teach nor be regularly employed in any other capacity that may limit or interfere with his duties as superintendent
371636 i dont think it would prohibit a superintendent from assisting a teacher especially on a limited basis so long as the superintendent is not the teacher of record for the students in any event i am very interested in working with teachers in such a role
371637 theres only one thing im concerned about and that is vision
371638 we dont have a vision of where we want to go that is what were missing
371639 the county commissioners will do something and they wont even look over at us and those so called meet and greets between the city council and county commissioners are a joke
371640 now in charlotte its more ill pull up my sleeve you pull up your sleeve and its ok if we get pissed at one another
371641 were too polite we dont get down to the nitty gritty
371642 i grew up reading about how bad things are and how greensboro cant do anything and all that stuff
371643 but at the end of the day our elected leaders are our employees and if we can light a fire under them then well see some action
371644 its our job to build the kind of city we want to stay in
371645 claim it go after it do it dont let people dwell on they can do it because they are charlotte syndrome the 101 principles are the same
371646 they the inspectors are coming in and telling us what to and were moving as fast as we can to go and fix it
371647 at this point its too early to say what well do when were facing such an uncertain situation
371648 well be pushing it close to the drop dead deadline if we go to the fifteenth of august but if by then were looking at having to make just a few modifications well stick with the delay
371649 but we obviously dont want to rule out adjusting to address the needs of students
371650 if you can compress four weeks into three i think people would prefer to wait it out and go into their yearly home together
371651 weve been hearing this since last september that the project will be finished by this date then that date
371652 i dont believe any of it anymore the community is already hurting if we have to go through more delays im scared of what will happen
371653 landed without incident after the captain became aware that the aircraft had a hydraulic leak
371654 on inspection engineers determined that fluid was coming from the spoiler actuator that was not evident before departure the spokeswoman said
371655 about about five minutes about taking off it was very obvious the plane very low in the sky it was very strange
371656 for 45 minutes we did not know what was going on
371657 the plane circled about an hour and a half dumping fuel from the plane
371658 the natural landscape and miles of sidewalk at mackintosh make the community the ideal place to hold a benefit run of this magnitude
371659 this is not however a time to celebrate barry george an innocent man has spent eight years in custody for a crime he did not commit
371660 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

371662 starts off in ken burns territory using a rich and exquisite mix of vintage sounds and images to track robert zimmerman of hibbing minn as he moves to new york and becomes folk singer bob dylan
371663 i was born very far from where im supposed to be
371664 it was the sound of other singers that got to me
371665 had a particular sound and besides that he said something
371666 he was a radical i thought thats what i want to say i want to say that
371667 i wrote em anywhere i was in a subway a cafe i wrote the songs to perform the songs in a language i hadnt heard before
371668 i knew he was going to be a massive star and i liked that
371669 its not an atomic rain its just a hard rain
371670 i heard hard rain and wept it seemed the torch had been passed from the beats to a new generation
371671 its almost enough to make you believe in jungs notion of collective unconscious
371672 if there is an american collective unconscious bobby had somehow tapped into it
371673 whatever it was about it wasnt about anything they were hearing
371674 procurar ser digno do respeito dos nossos amigos daqueles a quem tanto admiramos certamente uma boa justificativa para prosseguir

371690 i used to shop at the old a amp p here
371691 a lot of times i had to have someone drop me off
371692 i keep thinking its just a horror movie and we saw it and were going to wake up and were going to get out of the movie theatre and tim is going to be home and were all going to go out
371693 i cant see why this guy would even attack him
371694 he would never pick a fight he wouldnt intimidate the guy
371695 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
371696 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
371697 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
371698 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
371699 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
371700 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
371701 our customers appreciate not only the beauty of a luxury bathroom but also the feeling of being away from the routine and stress of the day
371702 they want an environment that is relaxing and sets the tone for them to really let down its the last retreat we have and our most private retreat
371703 based upon the circumstances with which corporal schultheis was confronted that morning he reasonably believed the decedents aggressive actions represented a deadly threat to himself and that corporal schultheis use of deadly force under those circumstances was justified
371704 he can get back to serving the men and women of greensboro
371705 while the death of mr paschal is certainly regrettable officer schultheis was left with no choice but to do what he did that night
371706 were happy that after a thorough investigation that the district attorney has agreed his actions were lawful
371707 that the foregoing events occurred in the predawn darkness with the only source of light being the blue lights of the officers patrol car and the decedents right hand was still concealed inside the waistband of his pants when ems personnel arrived at the scene
371708 she has a routine and this was not consistent with what she does
371709 all that matters is that she was found safe and sound and is with her family
371710 india has a role to play indias role in sri lanka is primary and india should play that role
371711 we had a very good and cordial meeting with the prime minister
371712 the prime minister listened to us very patiently very attentively and he appeared very concerned
371713 we are concerned that the government is not interested in finding a political solution that may be acceptable even to the tamil moderates
371714 hamnat i en kaotisk situation och m dde d ligt

371717 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness
371718 were not robbie williams or michael jackson we are just a group of monks who sing every day because it is our prayer and it is our life since the release of their album in may the monks who count pope benedict xvi among their fans have become an international smash hit creating records in pop and classical charts around the globe they have become international pop stars while their singing is still all about prayer they are grateful for the opportunity they have had to bring their devotion to a much wider audience
371719 dark chocolate is actually good for you because it has antioxidants
371720 by discussing it with a faith sharing group at my local parish
371721 well i never did embarrass my nation or violate its principles every hostage came home safe and free so my prayer was answered god answered my prayer later than i wanted if my prayer had been answered a week before the election of 1980 i would have been a two term president
371722 the most comprehensive intelligent christian response not just catholic response christian response to the sexual revolution that has been laid out since the 1950s
371723 is on my side not on the side of the hijacker god is on my side not on the side of the illness or the accident or the terrible thing that happened and thats enough to give me confidence
371724 from the sidelines of history the ones lost in the larger narrative of the holocaust
371725 according to a report microsoft isnt just looking at the next version of windows no not mojave for future os possibilities but is looking beyond the windows architecture altogether with a project known as midori
371726 the midori documents foresee applications running across a multitude of topologies ranging from client server and multi tier deployments to peer to peer at the edge and in the cloud data center
371727 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
371728 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
371729 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
371730 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
371731 it doesnt jibe with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor
371732 they had this big red van and were always taking a bunch of kids to swim meets
371733 one time he demonstrated his juggling skills by lying on his back in the department and juggling with his hands
371734 the roman catholic church should learn from other equally worthy christian denominations and eagerly welcome female clergy as well as married clergy
371735 there are people who you just know are ticking bombs
371736 and i just want to help out wherever they the fair board need me to
371737 i grew up in jackson so i am familiar with this area
371738 we hold church services on sunday mornings and they are full
371739 a lot of truckers run on sundays and cant get home to their own church
371740 high diesel prices are making it financially rough on many of the guys and trucking firms are going out of business by the hundreds
371741 we try to help them as best we can or advise them to seek more help
371742 our goal is to have 40 or 50 in the states so that a trucker would never be more than a days drive from one of our chapels
371743 funding that many is not the problem but finding that many chaplains is
371744 all i have to do is call the shellfish hotline and make sure its safe first
371745 we want to create something that will spur people to care for water quality
371746 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
371747 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
371748 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
371749 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
371750 it doesnt jibe with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor
371751 they had this big red van and were always taking a bunch of kids to swim meets
371752 well im done now ive got nothing more to accomplish and nothing more to look forward to

371754 its time to press on with the reform policies i promise to do my utmost to create a society where the people can live with peace of mind
371755 i will work consistently to share the same views as the people
371756 what people want is the replacement of the prime minister
371757 what is the new cabinet trying to do prime minister fukuda must take a leadership and squarely achieve his policies
371758 a ruling partys responsibility is not just focusing policies around elections
371759 it hurts me so much to miss the olympics and the u s open you have no idea
371760 i hate to give up these two games with utah
371761 but it frees us up to align ourselves with teams well have a competitive opportunity against
371762 this football program is getting there to give us some momentum toward controlling scheduling the way we would like utahs request was also an opportunity for us
371763 as i said we were amenable to his chris hills request
371764 and he appreciates that no i have no concerns were on the books with utah through 2015 and were already talking about games after that
371765 as long as brent guy and his fabulous play calling game schemes are around is it possible to get a couple of i aa games a year and maybe we can get 4 wins in one whole season
371766 the accc is particularly concerned that consumers may be misled if they are not made sufficiently aware that their data allocations can be exceeded at significant cost
371767 in the case of smart phones consumers can download greater amounts of information from the internet than ever before with this comes the potential for them to exceed their phone plan value and incur considerable additional charges
371768 consumers must think twice before signing contracts with a mobile phone carrier without upfront disclosure of all the fees and charges including excess data charges
371769 do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal
371770 no one can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other
371771 in every thing give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you
371772 the lamp of the body is the eye if therefore your eye is good your whole body will be full of light when our spiritual eyes are to be fixed on righteousness and heavenly treasures it has a trickle down effect to our physical eyes and daily expectations likewise when our spiritual eyes are fixed elsewhere it has the opposite effect that which hath been is named already and it is known that it is man neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he seeing there be many things that increase vanity what is man the better for who knoweth what is good for man in this life all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun that which hath been is named already it is man
371773 meaninglessness does not come from being weary of pain meaninglessness comes from being weary of pleasure
371774 if i find in myself a desire of which no experience in this world can satisfy the most probable explanation is that i was made for another world
371775 what is it you know now that you wish youd known as a younger man
371776 i wish i had known then what i know now when you get to the top there is nothing there
371777 whatever weakens your reasoning impairs the tenderness of your conscious obscures your sense of god or takes away your relish for spiritual things in short if anything increases the authority and power of the flesh over the spirit that then becomes sin however good it is in itself
371778 every pleasure has a shelf life god is the only perpetual shelf life
371779 the pleasure that you and i seek is the intimacy where god alone is enjoyed in worship it is worship that brings complete pleasure if you and i learn to worship individually the day becomes a pleasurable one because there is a cohesiveness from the grid of where other pleasure is inherited
371780 love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
371781 when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him then he will sit on the throne of his glory
371782 be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind
371783 a woman should not destroy the unborn babe in her belly nor after its birth throw it before dogs and vultures
371784 the law orders all the offspring be brought up and forbids women either to cause abortion or to make away with the fetus
371785 i saw women who produced children out of wedlock and who procured abortions
371786 when people who are fighting injure a pregnant woman so that there is a miscarriage and yet no further harm follows the one responsible shall be fined what the womans husband demands paying give life for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot burn for burn wound for wound stripe for stripe
371787 what reason would we have to commit murder when we say that women who induce abortions are murderers and will have to give account of it to god not regard the fetus in the womb as a living thing and therefore object to gods care and then kill it
371788 in our case murder being once for all for bidden we may not destroy even the fetus in the womb while as yet the human being dreives blood from other parts of the man killing not does it matter whether you take away a life that is born or destroy one that is coming to the birth which is going to be one you have the fruit already in the seed
371789 but women who resort to some sort of deadly abortion kill not only
371790 the fetus though enclosed in the womb of its mother is already a human being and it is a most monstrous crime to rob it of life which it has not yet begun to enjoy
371791 this team is probably deeper with pitching than a lot of teams ive had
371792 we know what the competition is going to be like
371793 last year i remember being really nervous because i didnt know what to expect theres nothing that can faze me now
371794 i try to be as much as a friend as i can be to these guys it makes them want to play harder for me because they know it means a lot to me
371795 if it wasnt for him i probably wouldnt be going to college
371796 i feel like we have the same mentality weve had all year
371797 weve just got to go in and take care of business
371798 north carolina is a bed of gospel talent and this will give them another avenue to showcase that talent and to minister in the way they want
371799 once a nonprofit gets that first grant its easier for them to get others
371800 the challenge is that if people dont know who we are they wont give to us
371801 a little bit of money from a lot of people can create a big change
371802 committed to bring the latest info in science amp technology and its latest reviews
371803 we are in a new building a new lab and we have new machines we have state of the art technology and the latest software new lights and new cameras
371804 one of the measures of success for students teachers and schools is how many students sign up for any one ap program
371805 i wanted to give back to society and i couldnt think of anything more important than giving back to young children
371806 art is a wonderful way to appreciate your surroundings and technology is key the more technical you are the easier it is for you to find a job i wanted to help children connect to art and be hirable in the future
371807 thematically we decided to look at it as being an insight into youth photography
371808 photography is a young field compared to painting but during a short amount of time it already has sort of re invented itself
371809 we see that the younger people in our society are the ones who really embrace technology so i thought it was a really good idea to parallel those two ideas linking the young artists and the younger artistic medium and tying in the newer technology factor
371810 they learned how to do a powerpoint presentation in the fourth grade i mean they knew how to navigate a mouse before they knew how to read it never surprises me how fast i can show them something and they can keep up with me
371811 the distinction that i like to make is that after you learn all the technical aspects of photography you can change your pictures from being a snapshot to becoming more a work of art
371812 we host the receptions because they give the students an opportunity to show their work and get that extra pride element of having their art on display
371813 i plan to continue with digital photography if not as a career then definitely as a hobby
371814 i mean i got a d40 for christmas this summer ive been going out and taking a lot of pictures and its just been so much fun
371815 tijdens een vergadering kwam hij zelden actief op de voorgrond
371816 vooral de nederlandsche bank volgt het hele gebeuren bij fortis op verbeten en gedetermineerde wijze op
371817 deze kwesties worden door politisering van de spelen niet opgelost
371818 the fuel costs are going to be a huge issue for people on fixed income of low and moderate means
371819 i for one will hear a lot of sighs of relief if it can reach out particularly to those who dont get help
371820 the sooner we address what we all know will be very tough times for so many people this winter the better
371821 id love to see the dollars come with flexibility versus saying use it for oil or you dont get it at all
371822 she does in this case support sticking to the portion of the call everyone agrees on
371823 when you put a driver in a truck making 15 to 20 an hour and youre talking diesel at 5 a gallon you want to maximize those deliveries
371824 when you make a stop at a house you want those to be the largest deliveries possible and i dont know if the average person has a tremendous benefit of a 25 gallon reduction
371825 they thought id been forthcoming with them and told me they were investigating several burglaries that fit alans modus operandi
371826 i said i have a manuscript upstairs that describes some of his criminal activities and youre free to have it if you want
371827 she indicated that she thought alan might be in trouble
371828 my sense was that it might have involved his former associates who were of an organized crime nature
371829 his police officer brother did not have a key to his apartment and this was a warrantless search of someones house
371830 he could not have been acting as an agent of the greenwich police if he was unaware of their investigation until two months later
371831 there was no contact with the gpd until after the evidence was gathered
371832 precious metal the confessions of a rock n roll jewel thief
371833 i considered it immoral and was somewhat perplexed that he would be able to profit at all given the son of sam law
371834 it was not something i supported that day i took it because i did not want it to be left for future discussions of the content and my whole intent was to keep it personal and guarded
371835 it would have to be information by which their case would either rise or fall
371836 most of the statements in the article are available from other sources on the public record
371837 if he was talking about all these topics then it would be valuable to know what else was said
371838 the best method i could think of was putting her inside the suitcase
371839 i took them in order to send to a brazilian in england who she stole money from he said he was going to kill her
371840 i was going to send them by email to show him that although he didnt have the courage to do it someone here did
371841 ill never recover from this my baby is in bits they cant even find her i need her back i just want to get my baby back where she belongs
371842 that monster has taken my girl he took her life and i want his she wasnt an angel but she didnt deserve that
371843 we are using this term femme to specifically and intentionally include lesbians and same gender loving women as well as genderqueers transwomen and folks of every sex and gender who identify as femme and see themselves as part of lgbtqia sgl and genderphile communities
371844 what would have happened if you had died first and your wife would have had to survive you
371845 oh for her this would have been terrible how she would have suffered
371846 such suffering has been spared her and it was you who spared her this suffering at the price that you now have to mourn her death
371847 give thanks in all circumstances for this is gods will for you in christ jesus
371848 well im not a very good christian anyway ive disappointed god so many times why should god help me
371849 well youre on your own now youre finally getting what you deserve
371850 you belong to me and i will always go to bat for you
371851 in this you greatly rejoice though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials these have come so that your faith may be proved genuine and may result in praise glory and honor when jesus christ is revealed
371852 listen i think everyone hopes this will bring some luck
371853 eclipses were reported where none took place in areas of political or bureaucratic strife
371854 wed already known about this eclipse many years before we got the right to host the olympics so how can we explain this is retribution
371855 one of the main reasons why i want to be on the board is that some of my family members are in the first ward the flds church you cant walk away from someone you love the biggest satisfaction i could have is to give people the deeds to their homes and remove the fear of being kicked out
371856 whatever you thought this trust is its a quagmire and we are trying to clean it up the best we can as quickly as we can
371857 jeff shields uep attorney and i are trying to get out of dodge if you will
371858 you are signing up for tough decisions with no clear answers and no clear guidelines for getting from here to there for roadblocks that get thrown up and probably fighting
371859 were you using the cell phone maybe a few seconds ago
371860 however with any new law or rule youre going to have some folks that dont follow the rules
371861 and we figure one month for those who dont follow the rules thats what the ticket book is for
371862 i think we need to get used to hands free talking because its dangerous
371863 i think its made a difference people are more conscious of what theyre doing
371864 i just forgot about the law you cant be on it no more so

371870 like this sunday i hope im playing good im wearing red and white with some black and white golf shoes trying to make a little statement thats what its all about out here
371871 i wore them for a while i was trying to get a contract with the company that made them and they didnt do it so i said to heck with it
371872 remember doug sanders and those guys they wore their red white and blue shoes
371873 i thought you could wear a bunch of outfits with beautiful shoes with red white and blue patent leather and stuff like that
371874 now the guys come out and play in tennis shoes golf wasnt designed to be played in tennis shoes youre supposed to have a little flair out there
371875 doug had i dont know how many different pairs of shoes and the colors tangerine and plum and colors that you wouldnt be caught dead in them but he wore them and wore them well
371876 but i think back in the late 60s and 70s there were some pretty strange looking things that everybody wore
371877 we were walking with the bell bottoms and the wide white belts and look whats coming back the white belts the skin tight shirts
371878 most of us have kind of been there done that or maybe have thought about it and rejected it for the most part thank goodness
371879 can you see some of us out there in outfits like that come on i mean ive been ribbed so many times about the si cover in 74 the white belt now you dont see those guys with dark belts theyre all white belts so give me a break we were setting the stage for these kids
371880 hvad han pr sterede er den st rste ol pr station nogensinde
371881 i have lost a bit of confidence in the laws
371882 a state where it hasnt been in the past four years
371883 we face a situation where things have happened in the recent past which were unfortunate
371884 at no time during the conversation did i threaten mr schultz in any way either expressly or implicitly regarding his continuation of this lawsuit or any other matter
371885 mr schultz told me that he did not believe the city had obtained in the settlement a sufficient commitment from the nba to locate a new team in seattle at some point in the future
371886 i explained to him that such a promise could not be made because these were issues for future deliberations of committees of the nba board of governors and the board itself
371887 unidos se realizan los proyectos y asi construimos un all boys mas grande
371888 por una pe a de los hinchas y para los hinchas de all boys
371889 a state where it hasnt been in the past four years
371890 we face a situation where things have happened in the recent past which were unfortunate
371891 ive served this nation honorably for more than half a century
371892 at no time have i ever done anything that would betray the public trust
371893 i never discussed it with john weaver as far as i know there was no necessity for it
371894 john weaver is a friend of mine he remains a friend of mine but i certainly didnt know anything of that nature
371895 they would serve as the model for my own nominees if that responsibility falls to me
371896 the african centered point of view does not assume superiority nor does it assume separatism it assumes africans speaking for themselves as subjects in history not objects in history
371897 when obamas enemies find out that in 1984 i went to tripoli to visit colonel gadaffi with farrakhan a lot of his jewish support will dry up quicker than a snowball in hell
371898 when minister farrakhan speaks black america listens everybody may not agree with him but they listen minister farrakhan will be remembered as one of the 20th and 21st century giants of the african american religious experience
371899 people of color had not gone away faded into the woodwork or just disappeared as the great white west went on its merry way of ignoring black concerns
371900 lack of economic opportunity among black men and the shame and frustration that came from not being able to provide for ones family
371901 the reality in which reverend wright and other african americans of his generation grew up for the men and women of reverend wrights generation the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years
371902 the reverend jeremiah wright is an outstanding church leader whom i have heard speak a number of times
371903 he has served for decades as a profound voice for justice and inclusion in our society he has been a vocal critic of the racism sexism and homophobia which still tarnish the american dream
371904 jerusalem will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
371905 if i forget thee o jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning if i do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if i prefer not jerusalem above my chief joy
371906 the city that was reunited the capital of israel for all eternity
371907 i know you want to take pictures but i dont want to be in them
371908 we have now received mr ben mullany at our intensive care unit at morriston hospital he arrived here by ambulance following an air ambulance flight from antigua
371909 the medical and nursing hand over process between the clinical team which accompanied him here and the intensive care team at morriston has now taken place
371910 initial medical assessments are now being undertaken by the morriston staff and it is too soon to give any further details
371911 the mps metropolitan police service team which will include one officer from south wales police will support the local senior investigating officers and have been sent following a request from the antiguan authorities received through the foreign and commonwealth office
371912 im overwhelmed i want to thank my family my legal team my medical team and all the people who have supported me at belmarsh whitemoor and manchester prisons and all my supporters
371913 we are disappointed by the verdict but especially disappointed for jills family and friends however we respect the decision of the court
371914 the investigation into her murder was complex thorough and professional with more than 2 500 statements taken and 3 700 exhibits recovered
371915 im as clever as can be and im very quick but dont forget youve only got so many tricks
371916 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
371917 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
371918 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
371919 we will want to know if the new civilian government in pakistan is aware of whats going on
371920 that is why we are talking to pakistan thats why we are carrying on these conversations
371921 i have been tracking y combinator a new kind of venture firm for early early stage startups for several years they have a distinctive approach to the early stage funding process and have funded some interesting companies yc is in the news again because of googles recent acquisition of omnisio a yc investment
371922 ather than point out that the idea is not a new one or shoot it down in flames i thought id look at the idea from three perspectives the people who might need a tech hub the people who might run it and the people who might fund it in my experience its the overlaps and more importantly the differences between the needs of these three groups that most schemes like this dont plan for and find difficult to accommodate
371923 ive been doing a few presentations about online communities recently and i finally got around to uploading a few of them to slideshare i thought people might be interested in seeing them
371924 a personal web archive that allows people to save web pages on iterasis server the personal accounts can be searched and shared with others
371925 their pearl district office may be festooned with stuffed monkey dolls a string of monkey lights even a monkey face door mat but chris and ryan finley arent monkeying around
371926 act on their own in ways that are not in convergence
371927 we need to identify these people and weed them out
371928 that would spell danger to pakistan in the long run they america want to make us subservient to india
371929 the isi is under the policy directive of the man who calls the shots
371930 it may not be the prime minister it may not be the president but the army chief is always kept in the loop
371931 the reason for this sustained progress is the success of the surge
371932 a degree of durability to the gains we have made
371933 single minded and open ended focus on iraq is not a sound strategy for keeping america safe
371934 in fact as should have been apparent to president bush and senator mccain the central front in the war on terror is not iraq and it never was
371935 there clearly have been worrisome trends in afghanistan in recent months in particular
371936 we believe the employee free choice act is a bad bill and we have been on the record as opposed to it
371937 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression they are wrong and acting without approval
371938 half of our political action committee contributions are to members of each party
371939 we regularly educate our associates on issues which impact our company and this is an example of that
371940 nah they wont talk during the test first of all theyre older and therefore mature i mean we are talking about students in a masters program
371941 the most fundamental thing you all should know about italian theatre is fwa fwa fwa
371942 sarah you have a gift that not many people have why would you take not many students could do what you can do and besides i know you didnt come here to travel keep the italian grammar class to polish everything off enroll at luniversita and continue with the internship
371943 venezia e come una donna vecchia e malata molto vecchia e abbastanza malata
371944 he may bear arms in our company without let or hindrance and be known among us as a swordsman and practitioner of this ancient and honorable art
371945 the national judges will be looking for excellence in floral and permanent planting how issues surrounding conservation and recycling are being addressed together with environmental quality they will also want to know how britain in bloom is being promoted at a local level and meeting this years theme of local roots
371946 the rest of the judging team and i are really looking forward to visiting this years national finalists to see first hand just what a huge difference their efforts are making in creating a more pleasant environment for their communities to live in
371947 we will be looking for how local issues which affect everyday life are being addressed 365 days a year through community horticulture for example planting up a run down area in a city centre can cut petty crime its the wider benefits of gardening as a community that underpin britain in bloom and make it such a fantastic competition
371948 ivins would have stood to make tens of thousands of dollars but not millions
371949 it will depend on the business arrangements that are in place
371950 i dont think he ever intended to kill anybody he just wanted to prove look this is possible he probably had no clue that it would aerosolize through those envelopes and kill those postal workers
371951 the governor promised california when he was running for this job that he was the leader that could work with the legislature to get responsible budgets for california
371952 i needed this job to continue to do my part in being their mother to provide them with the security that they need
371953 it hurts me to my heart to have to tell my sons this
371954 understands how difficult this is going to be for state workers
371955 its a day by day situation so well try to manage
371956 i knew when they start cutting jobs youre going to get poor service
371957 we dont believe the governor has the authority to lay off state workers by executive fiat and thats what that executive order does
371958 we will defend ourselves in court if necessary to make sure the state can meet its obligations
371959 imagine going in to talk to your boss and saying lets talk about wages and he says well im cutting you to minimum wage now what do you want to talk about
371960 the fact is new money and new blood often represent thousands of rolex collectors around the world who will be waiting years to own limited edition used rolex models
371961 compact and easy to carry and high quality zoom capability
371962 when fraud so permeates the election as this and it is done intentionally it has to be voided
371963 they disregarded the campaign finance laws they disregarded the ethics laws of new mexico they also disregarded the federal tax laws
371964 substantial difference in the three elections contested and would have changed the results had the fraud not occurred
371965 het verschil met de eds deal is echter dat deze latere uitbestedingsovereenkomst complexer is
371966 de transactie met eds was qua opzet traditioneel er werd zaken gedaan met n grote partij een paar jaar later koos abn amro ervoor om met meerdere leveranciers in zee te gaan het voordeel is dat je niet meer afhankelijk bent van n it partner het nadeel is dat de ontvlechting van it processen lastiger is zeker als je daarna weer voor inbesteding kiest
371967 het gaat om substanti le datamigratie en dataverwerkingstrajecten daar hebben de banken hulp van buiten bij nodig
371968 lo nico que es necesario para que el mal triunfe es que los hombres de bien no hagan nada
371969 probably the best class ive ever had in my life and ive been going to training classes for over 30 years
371970 this train the trainer workshop is very useful effective and money well spent
371971 its an extremely effective method you know the people being trained will experience quality learning
371972 this training course is an excellent experience and i highly recommend it
371973 we have to remove the obstacles that block the human drive for knowledge and that prevent the workplace from being the productive place it wants to be
371974 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and senator obama did
371975 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
371976 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
371977 do you think you are better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago if you arent better off can you afford another four years
371978 a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage
371979 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
371980 i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
371981 mamn what were you doing at the wakonda country club
371982 i was attempting to make a citizens arrest of karl rove your honor
371983 mamn what were you doing at the wakonda country club
371984 we hope that colleagues will have heard from their constituents that something has to be done and done before congress finishes its business this year
371985 can begin to break the current legislative stalemate on the senate floor
371986 would bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term
371987 we would need to see a bill that would increase the supply here in our own country across the board in a comprehensive way
371988 the fact that theyre uncomfortable means were doing the right thing
371989 within the first lesson i got up on the board but im on my sixth lesson now and i dont get up all the time on sunday i got up twice but i tried it 10 times
371990 that never happened im flabbergasted by this whole thing this is the ultimate betrayal
371991 we knew what we needed to do to respond and react
371992 weve actively been taking steps to reduce our exposure to leasing
371993 we talked about doing a joint together a whole album its not about just selling records for me anymore cause ive done that its about making something that people will remember
371994 poor old amy aimless winehouse would be a better term i love all kinds of music but the one thing i have never done is imitate black music in her idiotic way
371995 theres not a single word that means anything its not like these songs are deeply moving or inspirational or cultural in any way you could find useful
371996 in countries with low prevalence of initial multi drug resistance the standardized treatment regimens for new case appear to be adequate
371997 however in countries where the prevalence of initial drug resistance exceeds three percent we believe it is urgent to strengthen capacity to perform drug sensitivity testing or to re evaluate these standard treatment regimens given the unacceptably high rates of failure and relapse
371998 we hypothesized that in countries using standardized initial and retreatment regimens the proportion of patients with poor treatment outcomes would be correlated with prevalence of initial and acquired multi drug resistance
371999 this is striking evidence that mdr tb is directly linked to the increased failure rates of our current treatment regimens
372000 in the short term the higher the failure and relapse rates mean greater morbidity and mortality for patients with greater social and economic harm for their families and communities in the long term these standardized regimens may be contributing to amplification of multi drug resistance in these countries
372001 i believe theyre going to come through in the clutch and keep getting better
372002 i dont know how to describe it the only thing i know is that im going to play the game hard and give all i have to help the team
372003 every time people ask me about boston i pull my brain and go pop
372004 im not going to waste any energy when people talk like that
372005 i took like 5 000 pounds off my back coming here i want people to judge me on what i do here not on what i did in boston im thinking dodger blue right now im happy to be playing here and im excited to wear blue ive been playing this game for 15 years and im like a little kid now
372006 its a new chapter in my life and im nervous
372007 we would like to see as many people trained as we can
372008 the professors are guys who have been out there and done that
372009 i think everyone has a responsibility to be prepared for any type of emergency especially with everything that has happened in the last few months with tornadoes earthquakes and flooding
372010 by being well prepared for emergency situations it saves lives and also helps communities recover quicker and return back to normal status
372011 and while it may have shown a smaller drop than expected that isnt saying much
372012 the u s labor market is saying the u s economy is in recession
372013 compared with previous recessions the pace of job loss remains low but that is primarily because job gains had been tepid in recent years as many businesses kept a tight rein on their labor costs
372014 is that many who are not finding full time employment are getting part time jobs
372015 pretty awful but were still waiting for a blockbuster plunge
372016 its a wonderful technology and people are certainly going to be using it more and more
372017 we need to be looking into what are the potential health effects and what are ways to reduce risks should there be any
372018 pupunta tayo dun sa inirekomenda sa kin ng tita lalie mo na manggagamot magaling daw yun kahit anong sakit nagagamot niya wala namang mawawala kung tignan lang natin

372029 an antihistamine used in the treatment of allergic symptoms and may have sedative effects
372030 if the federal aviation administration had been aware of this medication the pilot would have been issued a warning not to fly within 12 hours of taking it
372031 it gets real frustrating because a lot of the people that we run through there they want help and some of them dont
372032 the type of people youre talking about in that situation are not the kind of people that are going to take their family to a restaurant on sunday and maybe have a beer with their mexican food
372033 if you have to drive further to get it and if you really want it you go get it then you tend to drink it before you drive back home
372034 so i think its safer to have it close to home
372035 as a citizen of gallup ive been here 16 years ive seen enough death and seen enough tragedy from alcohol related things
372036 i think weve missed out on a lot of conventions we might have been able to have here
372037 some national chain restaurants wouldnt come in because they cant sell on sundays
372038 it was my absolute failure as a rock n roller i so blew it
372039 i really lost out there ive regretted it all my life it was a terrible mistake
372040 we can sustain this weve been in dispute for a week and there has been action every day in most departments
372041 were really geared up for the weekend its a big weekend in sky city because of the bledisloe cup and its absolutely business as usual
372042 im a real down to earth guy thats had a lot of problems in my life since birth
372043 i am a complicated guy theres too much to tell either love me or hate me but either way im me
372044 yeah its true it was me that cut the two girls but dat was a long time ago i have changed i just want a good life from now on and another chance
372045 child abuse once thought to be primarily a problem of the poor and downtrodden occurs in every segment of society and may be the countrys leading cause of death in children
372046 nico mon fils il faut faire b tir comme a les gens ils verront que tu as r ussi dans la vie
372047 so youre just gonna clap for that one f ckin song
372048 i dont think its negative i think were drawing differences between us
372049 i responded to it because im disappointed and i dont want that issue to be part of this campaign
372050 i was in union missouri which is 98 percent white a rural conservative community and what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates
372051 i think that what people are really concerned about what theyre looking for is fundamental change on the economy things that are going to help their families live out the american dream there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this what this has become i think is a typical pattern from the mccain campaign whether its paris hilton or britney or this phony allegation that i wouldnt visit troops they seem to be focused on a negative campaign what i think our campaign wants to do is focus on the issues that matter to american families
372052 it definitely ranks up there with one of the better moments ive had
372053 the film encompasses all the best things people loved about the show
372054 its scary creepy and has a good mystery with the x files we often scared people by what they didnt show and we use that device for the movie as well
372055 i was real paranoid about people finding out what happens in it
372056 obama also doesnt want us to know as i fully covered in his chicago period in the book that he participated on sic louis farrakhans million man march
372057 weve covered that because nobody else in the media picked up on that
372058 we dont know if he ever met with louis farrakhan now he knocked on the door of former 60s radical current university of chicago professor william ayers and ive often wondered considering he went to the million man march hes in chicago he was politically ambitious any evidence he knocked on the door of farrakhan
372059 i havent had a picture yet of the two of them together
372060 but if you take a look at father pfleger and all the rest of the associations that whole group and rev wright was very close to farrakhan i demonstrate in the book very carefully that rev wright was for a time a black muslim
372061 fox news channel is committed to providing viewers with more factual information in a balanced fair presentation the balanced fair presentation was said by sean hannity no less our job is to tell them the truth wherever that truth falls
372062 im not scared i think its going to be quite liberating
372063 its difficult to age with dignity in the pop business but id like to think ive managed it so far
372064 its a notoriously difficult market to know where i fit is very difficult
372065 sometimes i go out there and give up four five runs and the team will bounce back and win the ballgame those things happen its part of the game
372066 my mechanics was a lot better than it was in boston because my sinker was going downhill instead of going side to side
372067 i changed speeds kept them off balance and i couldnt have done it without my defense
372068 when the moment came around somehow i made quality pitches and got out of the inning
372069 ponson did what he had to do he threw his pitches when he had to and they made great defensive plays behind him fortunately ervin matched him pitch for pitch
372070 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u s
372071 cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multidimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war confrontation with communism
372072 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning the conflict but it alone will not bring victory
372073 on entering you were hit by a wall of cheap perfume and roll on deodorant smoke sweat and dancing bodies all accompanied by a throbbing r amp b soundtrack as you pushed your way to the front there were three rows of old cinema seats in front of which there was a small stage for the band to perform on with hammond organ drums and amplifiers set up to the left on a raised platform there was a coffee bar type area from where you could oversee the stage and the rest of the club a foot or so below and from which you could view the band and check out the girls dancing before you attempted to make a move

372082 he played with a lot of emotion this week its been a very very rough week for him
372083 they havent seen me and i havent seen them so they really had no idea how i was going to attack them
372084 i know we threw a lot of off speed stuff theyre a really good fastball hitting team and sometimes thats what you got to do to win

372088 to ensure the state has enough cash to cover its costs
372089 state law contractually guarantees that state employes ultimately will receive their full salary for work performed during a budget impasse
372090 does not authorize the controller to disburse state funds to the employes until an applicable appropriation has been enacted
372091 i dont want to subject the state of california to legal liability
372092 under the fair labor standards act if we do not pay full wage we may be subject to treble damages that would only exacerbate an already difficult financial situation
372093 would we want to test it when there is very little upside and significant downside at risk
372094 i like to call it malignant malaise dealing with insurance companies crooked contractors still trying to get back into your house insurance rates going up people are having problems with that
372095 people were displaced and our support systems disappeared our neighbors who used to be there for years and years in some cases are gone and people have trouble with that they look next door and their buddy is not their anymore
372096 theres been a lot of self medication street drugs prescription medication abuse of course alcohol so id say demand for those services has almost doubled

372107 this guy has carried us to where we are today
372108 hes been great he seldom walks anybody really all he does is throws strikes
372109 i decided to start this project because i think it is a really easy way for people to help out their community while at the same time getting rid of clutter
372110 reading during my elementary years let me explore new worlds it also immensely helped my writing and vocabulary skills something which is very useful in everyday life i would like for more children to have greater access to books as i think it will help their overall education
372111 debaters tend to be the type of students who enjoy reading
372112 and ive found that many families have old books collecting dust in their house since debaters are now well beyond their elementary years they have no use for their old books stories for students is a great way for these high schoolers to better the community while creating more space in their homes
372113 i think from what jack tretton said the reaction has been well summarised by yahoo who said that in terms of games the competition have probably got a slightly weaker line up than ps3
372114 and we obviously agree with that we think weve got title after title after title not only first party but third party and i think in america they have the advantage of the video downloads service which came at exactly the right time
372115 were confident but not only that were confident about the games industry more than anything else what we should be celebrating is how well the games industry is doing compared to other industries in the last nine months with the current recession worldwide more and more people are coming in its astounding
372116 i think from what jack tretton said the reaction has been well summarised by
372117 they re not saying hey you guys theyre saying hej the swedish formal greeting
372118 if you could would you take off your shoes at the door
372119 who wouldve thought four years ago that wed be sitting together today
372120 its a nice situation to be in this year where we have enough kids that have played under this system last year who understand the offense and defense so its not like we are starting from scratch like last year
372121 even though we werent totally starting from scratch with our players last year for the kids it was an all new system
372122 it is a lot nicer to come out here today and have a good understanding of what we are doing and what we want
372123 we have nine seniors on the team this year we have some kids that are coming back that are pretty good we have some good leaders and some kids that really lead by example they know how to get it done and they know how to work
372124 johnstown is tough they got a lot of kids back so they are probably going to be the team to beat utica got their quarterback back and has some real good players as well any number of teams could win this league right now its going to be tough
372125 weve got our starting fullback and our starting tailback from last year back that is definitely going to be a big strength for us in that aspect
372126 we are going to have to work on improving our passing game
372127 we have spent a lot of time this summer working on that we have gotten better but we still have a ways to go
372128 i think our biggest thing this year to a successful year is to stay healthy
372129 we look at about 30 kids here we play in a league where schools have three to four times the number of kids to choose from we have about 17 upperclassman and they are going to be a big thing for us
372130 we open up with fisher catholic who is a perennial power
372131 they are a playoff team year in and year out we played them two years ago in the playoffs and they have some kids back from that team i think they are going to be a little young but they are going to come at you and hit you and we need to play at that same level we are excited about it but its a tough opener we have pretty high expectations for this team
372132 her name is coco but her nickname is the beast and i want to get rid of her nickname

372134 the burns looked like they were a week and a half old it looked like a small infection had begun
372135 the main thing you are trying to prevent on a burn is infection or any type of external debris sticking to it
372136 the best thing to do is put dry sterile gauze on the wound
372137 i came back because i got a job here to help both the iraqis and americans supporting the war on terrorism
372138 its always good to help the iraqis to know whats going on and what they are going through
372139 we are dealing with very basic medications here but we are helping at least 60 to 70 percent of the population
372140 basically what we try to do is give them our advice if we cant treat them here go see a specialist
372141 others we give medication especially for those who havent seen a doctor in years and dont have access to medical care when they get the antibiotics and painkillers i think it will be great for them in the long run
372142 for me there is no greater reward to be able to help somebody put a smile on somebodys face

372183 we have interest in africans or people of color period
372184 very knowledgeable very concerned and would fix it if they could
372185 they now know about darfur and someday that might lead to something
372186 i thought it was kind of schocking to see the images that they had there
372187 they didnt hold anything back there were skulls and dead bodies they really showed what was going on in darfur
372188 i thought it was pretty cool it was really cool to see something before everyone else even if it was just a rough cut
372189 but it was a different type of premier it was more serious
372190 i think they could have done a lot more as far as the time they actually aired it it wasnt even primetime it wasnt sufficeint
372191 they are fine people and an asset to our community
372192 even though its a delicate bridge i think its still worth the attempt to move it
372193 wed like to preserve a bit of history with this its the only bowstring truss bridge left in the county
372194 i think its in the citys best interest to maintain our 7 1 2 miles of brick streets

372197 when they scored a lot of runs that brought us down
372198 thats a good hitting team theyve been here three times and this is our first time you can definitely tell that the first time down here we probably werent ready for what to expect
372199 you look back at it now maybe we should have started someone that was able to establish their breaking ball
372200 air traffic controllers received a call from the pilot declaring an emergency and proceeded to give priority clearance for a landing at sydney
372201 this year i am switching to the defensive side of the ball and coordinating our defense
372202 we did that because of the personnel we brought in that were new
372203 in a high school setting a lot of times you have a lot of change in your coaching staff
372204 most of my experience is on the defensive side of the football it is no problem for me i felt like this was a good way to go
372205 the fact that these guys have been in the school and have been teaching these kids is great they have dealt with them before and they know their personalities it is a good matchup
372206 coach keller talked with me about coming back and taking over the offense when he first approached me it kind of renewed my interest in it
372207 i had been out of it for a few years and i thought this might be kind of fun when you are given an opportunity you try to take advantage of it i thought it was a good time to come back and give it a shot
372208 we are going to be a wing t team which is different from what we did last year as an option passing team
372209 we will try to become more of a ball control football team
372210 defensively we will be doing some things different too we will just have to see it comes down to personnel and how much we can pick up right now we are trying to fit personnel into positions
372211 we are changing things scheme wise we are going back to the wing t were trying to stay basic and go back to the fundamentals blocking sustaining drives controlling the football as far as doing a bunch of things different ive watched a few ball games the last few years and we just need to build on the things the kids have been doing hopefully we will have some success with it
372212 it is going to be a great benefit for me having coach gastin with me and also coach dennis
372213 we all got together and decided to come back together it is a group effort being able to work together we know each other and know what each of us can do we know we are all going to treat the kids well thats a bonus
372214 our ultimate goal is for the kids to have some success and win some ball games thats what we want
372215 we have very similar philosophies when it comes to that we want the kids to do well it has really been no problem at all blending with what coach keller has done
372216 officers can detain laptops for a reasonable period of time to review and analyze information

372220 this is the toughest thing ive ever been a part of but sometimes you have to go in a different direction
372221 we just felt we needed to try a different direction a different voice a different message
372222 look i understand san francisco is in a jam financially
372223 but you cant make it so painful that people dont want to do impulse shopping in the city eventually thats going to hurt the merchants
372224 but the reality is that we have to look wherever we can to increase revenue and parking fines do represent a significant part of our revenue
372225 no one wants to look at the person next to you and think theyve gotten a free ride

372250 the numbers show that the made in germany label continues to be a quality seal
372251 theres still a strong trend to invest abroad which shouldnt be confused with moving production abroad

372292 i think that people you know you get the impression from the little story of how the amateurs learned to dance in a week that you can learn to do it
372293 i think there are a lot of people who dont really realize exactly how much work it is to learn to do it because tv performers are doing it six or seven hours a day for the show and we all have jobs
372294 people were legitimately anxious they really didnt know what the scope of the problem was

372334 cuando usted tiene casi la mitad de la poblaci n evitando ciertos alimentos por razones de seguridad eso es muy importante desde el punto de vista del impacto econ mico para el pueblo la venta de alimentos y desde el punto de vista de la paz de la mente de los consumidores
372335 y m s si los inspectores van a impedir que la gente de enfermarse y morir entonces vale la pena
372336 vivimos en una era de tecnolog a donde se puede de c digos de barras un pl tano

372338 they had discovered the radiation leak weeks ago and did not inform the japanese government immediately
372339 the u s navys handling of the accident and lack of transparency showed there is no way we can trust them
372340 the reattachment appears up to now to have proceeded optimally
372341 his nature was more primitive bedouin person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute
372342 he was not with the ideology of osama bin laden and people like him he was only searching for pleasure and money in this life
372343 he is intending to invoke self incrimination rights and not appear
372344 an a for effort but their proposal is unsatisfactory and needs many improvements
372345 you certainly cant say that there hasnt been an effort to move this thing
372346 but there seems to be always something more important to fight about
372347 before it was taboo to even talk openly about condoms
372348 groups still oppose condom use but at least we can mention the word
372349 some people here always had money but money without curiosity means nothing now theres more willingness to explore
372350 how am i supposed to know if someone is a prostitute
372351 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with that investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him
372352 a world renowned and highly decorated scientist who served his country for over 33 years with the department of the army
372353 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
372354 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation
372355 the fbi would be remiss not to look at us especially those of us who worked with anthrax
372356 we were all subjected to lie detector tests we were all interviewed
372357 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
372358 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
372359 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
372360 why is it that you have not spoken to the issues or spoken on behalf of the african community
372361 that doesnt mean im always going to satisfy the way you guys want me to talk which gives you the option of voting for someone else which gives you the option of running for office yourself
372362 i note with interest today john mccains new tactic of associating barack obama with oversexed and or promiscuous young white women
372363 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
372364 hes not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the united states
372365 the fact that were reduced to trying to send messages to the pakistanis by putting stories in newspapers tells you we dont have any good options
372366 the trouble is these kinds of public threats are likely to backfire
372367 one thing we never understood is that india has always been the major threat for pakistan
372368 we have created a set of perverse incentives for the pakistanis to continue their support for the taliban
372369 at no time was there a risk to the submarine reactor plant the safety of the crew or the safely of the public
372370 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas
372371 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews
372372 i dont like it when people easily condemn someone who has an addiction as if he were a criminal as if he were a person who should be persecuted
372373 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas
372374 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews
372375 technical conditions for internet web subsystems units equipment and installation

372378 america is where they welcome everybody regardless of their place of birth
372379 only in america three guys with funny names and dark skins are going to beijing three american guys
372380 not one person in my neighbourhood has a building permit
372381 illegal building is simply a pretext for destroying palestinian families homes and lives
372382 the demolitions are part of a policy to stop the natural expansion of palestinian communities in and around jerusalem freeing up the maximum amount of land for use by israeli settlers
372383 the demolitions increase the pressure on palestinians to move into the west bank so that they will lose their residency rights in the city
372384 this is the first time a government has supported the rebuilding of an illegal palestinian home demolished by the israeli authorities
372385 makanya klo takut kebakar jangan main api klo takut resikonya gak usah jatuh cinta pikirin dlu sebelum buat komitment baik dan buruknya
372386 we are determined to continue the raid until we arrest all those involved
372387 the suspect was on the transformer and grabbed one of the live wires
372388 we reserve all judgments while information is obtained to allow for proper review as done in any case where accusations are made
372389 in trying to physically detain him there was a pushing and shoving match
372390 on the right of lebanons people the army and the resistance to liberate all its territories
372391 the progress these kids have made is tremendous and the rating doesnt show the hard work these teachers have put in
372392 i think we are likely to see some changes to the rating system next legislative session
372393 for example we are discussing measurements that more accurately reflect teachers successes instead of forcing them to teach strictly to the taks test
372394 identify opportunities to streamline the rating process so that its easier to understand allowing schools teachers and families greater opportunity to be involved
372395 that one word rating will never tell the full story
372396 that sort of responsiveness to community expectations is not measured under the current accountability system
372397 it might be fairer to have some kind of growth model in there as well
372398 the problem is theyre trying to do something you really cant do you cant quantify an education
372399 even if that word is exemplary its still not going to show the whole picture
372400 we try to do well in those ratings but thats not the end all its just a part of the picture
372401 the rating system in and of itself is not fair because its not comparing apples to apples
372402 we are kind of a label society but when you put a label on something its black and white and something you need to look at are the grays
372403 come visit us and see how you feel when you walk in this building
372404 my niece lived here she died of cancer at 32
372405 the people who lived through love canal need to know what their risks are and what they might expect for their children
372406 the state health department is proud of the work we have done on love canal over the years
372407 they knowingly and willfully joined the same conspiracy with the same objective
372408 i could probably drop a package of sweet n low and evacuate this building
372409 i want to look my fellow americans directly in the eye and declare to them i am not the anthrax killer
372410 i know nothing about the anthrax attacks i had absolutely nothing to do with this horrible crime
372411 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
372412 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions
372413 and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today
372414 i think in fairness you have to let those guys show
372415 and the scrimmage is actually the best place its like a game and we see how theyve processed what weve done so far without help and so when we decide whos going to play and how many snaps and all that kind of stuff its never quite fair but we try to pinpoint certain areas certain players that we need to have more information on
372416 i cant take my eyes off the prize i know that i have to keep improving my technique and getting better at the little things
372417 i love playing over there at qwest its a live situation full tackling itll be good to really get into it
372418 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas
372419 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews
372420 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas
372421 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews
372422 we have to move forward to the nsg we are going to keep this momentum up
372423 the countries acknowledge indias requirements and legitimacy of india asking for access to nuclear energy and they seem to acknowledge that this is in their benefit
372424 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas
372425 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews
372426 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas
372427 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews
372428 but they did throw a lot of junk in there i just think a lot of people who own in this area
372429 now are more distressed players and are hoping for a turnaround not only with gm but with the u s economy
372430 but when you peel it back the cash flow impact is not that bad here and we have a liquidity plan in order to bridge us from now to the end of 09 and again i think 2010 will be a defining year for us in general motors in terms of reducing the cash flow burn and also generating cash again
372431 theyre going to survive 08 and through probably the first part of 09
372432 but it looks like theyre burning through nearly 4 billion a quarter this is probably the worst it gets it may get a little bit worse but i dont know how much worse it can get theyll probably have to raise more capital a few more quarters like this in a row theyll probably have to file
372433 this was all part of the analysis when we announced our liquidity plan a couple of weeks ago
372434 the results we announced today were fully comprehended in the liquidity plan
372435 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas
372436 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews
372437 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas
372438 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews
372439 it looked like it was all set up for something spectacular
372440 its like boston with the people cheering for you he made a good pitch you have to give him credit
372441 the fans received me with open arms it was unbelievable
372442 i was like a kid today i was so nervous
372443 im just glad to get my first hit out of the way
372444 sometimes youve got to ride that bike until the wheels fall off and that hasnt happened yet
372445 it has to be a full moon for him to walk somebody
372446 hes pretty much owned me my whole career so any time you get on base against him its a plus
372447 if you expand your zone against him hell eat you alive i was looking for a pitch to hit he just didnt give me one
372448 hes been playing with a lot of emotion this week and its been rough on him
372449 but hes kept his focus on baseball and its been a good release for him
372450 runners on first and second no one out he got out of it and gave us a chance to catch our breath a bit
372451 all the groups had good materials so we took a collaborative approach we all wanted the same thing to help people recover from their addictions
372452 the guide is unique in the history of church publishing it was written by individuals who have suffered from addiction and who have experienced the miracle of recovery through the atonement of jesus christ with support from church leaders and counseling professionals
372453 the magic of the group meetings is that everyone is in the same boat
372454 i found that for me the program is rooted in the gospel of jesus christ
372455 it was a rocky road in the beginning but with a lot of meetings and working the steps i became free from these addictions
372456 i didnt become free from temptation but i no longer felt compelled to give into temptation i was finally free to choose to turn away from these addictions and was free to choose better things in life
372457 i wanted to share with others the experience faith and hope that had been shared with me
372458 it is the key that unlocks the addiction door and it took some time soaking in the safe open environment of faith and testimony for my heart to soften
372459 after a while i was able to start letting go of the smaller pieces of the addiction and as my faith in christ increased i began letting go of bigger and bigger pieces i couldnt get that kind of faith from reading books or talks
372460 i had to leave isolation behind and meet together oft to fast and to pray and to speak one with another concerning the welfare of our souls
372461 meetings focus on solutions rather than problems emphasizing the power of the atonement of jesus christ to overcome any difficulty
372462 we wanted to wait until the very end of the session and let the wind come to us
372463 plus wed know what everyone elses time is it worked out just right
372464 as a boat racer we dont get a chance to do very much for the community
372465 heres a chance to do something and the whole team is putting a little extra something into it
372466 im just going to try not to chew anyones ear off out there as long as we make the final we dont care how many points we get
372467 ive won this race at 138 mph in rough race conditions a lot of times
372468 so to be able to run 148 and later 153 mph in rough water and be fastest of the session were happy with that
372469 the good thing is that were testing and qualifying in what will be our race water
372470 if you have a race boat that can go fast in this water you have a boat that can win this is basically our race package and thats an awesome speed for heat racing
372471 they said they cant let me in without the bridge program
372472 the bad is im not able to come up there now and compete the good is that my eligibility clock doesnt start until january so that gives me a chance to get an extra spring ball under my belt
372473 both taxes and spending appear to have large distributional effects on households
372474 im not because i watched how these guys built it last week
372475 today we just want to get the boat back on the water and make sure the rudder is in the right place
372476 i believe in god and hard work if we dont win it wont be because of a lack of work thats for sure i lift my hat to the crew because they did an awesome job getting this boat ready
372477 hell tell me when to be cautious and when to fly the boat
372478 our relationship is like a quarterback and a wide receiver who have played together for a long time we communicate instantly
372479 what i saw last weekend because i watched pretty close and what i saw this weekend the field should be very frightened
372480 i ran that lap and crew chief tony gibson was telling me how awesome it was and everything i said man if jimmie can beat that he can have it
372481 well he not only beat me he humiliated me by two tenths of a second
372482 when that happens on the field usually guys have helmets on
372483 but this happened on the sidelines so it probably wasnt a good idea
372484 i know team president mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
372485 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football
372486 i wasnt really a huge horner fan before this but i am now what a class act
372487 the book is specifically designed to normalize gay marriage and is targeted toward the 2 7 year old age group
372488 find it inappropriate that this type of literature is available to this age group
372489 this was not the type of conversation i thought i would be having with my seven year old in the nightly bedtime routine
372490 marriage is a covenant between a man and a woman as stated in the websters dictionary and also in the bible
372491 the uses of enchantment the meaning and importance of fairy tales
372492 1 the state of being married relation between husband and wife 2 the act of marrying wedding 3 the rite or form used in marrying 4 any close or intimate union
372493 im going to go out there and play my heart out and try to shoot as low as i can and not really be concerned about what phil does
372494 to me him not being here is the difference between 39th and 38th
372495 jack nicklaus isnt here so i guess thats a substitute
372496 i feel my game is a lot better obviously the score doesnt show it but i know what i need to work on
372497 shadow of colossus is a beautifully told tale richly detailed and set beneath one of the great wonders of the world if youve ever dreamed of traveling in the ancient world youll want to be there as a fallen woman rises and the great colossus falls
372498 hauck is quickly making a name for herself as an insightful thoughtful author
372499 since its one third of the formula to decide who plays in the national championship game
372500 i have been through worse it will only get better
372501 colleen and her aunt should hang out together and talk about how they like to be mean to us
372502 i dont know how to say this but your grandmother passed away last night

372520 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
372521 offensively were tuning some things up weve got two more games before the real deal starts
372522 six months ago when the first trailer for wall e came out we were only halfway done with the film and we werent exactly sure how we were going to get it done we were exhausted and then one day a movie showed up on youtube showing a girl watching the trailer for wall e and every time she watched it she would cry on cue when we saw that we knew we were on the right track
372523 itll all work out as long as we keep inventing great technology with our can do attitudes
372524 i cant believe this environzi propoganda that rich hypocrite al gore must be involved somehow awful just awful you guys didnt like it did you
372525 um ah brain warning danger danger will robinson loaded question alert hmm uh no of course not mom
372526 i wanted eve to be high end technology no expense spared and i wanted it to be seamless and for the technology to be sort of hidden and subcutaneous the more i started describing it the more i realized i was pretty much describing the apple playbook for design
372527 you just know they were playing portal when they came up with the idea for this
372528 dont fall for that propaganda that indian is faking he is only trying to lull you into into going out of the car to throw your mc happy meal bag away where he will then shoot you with arrows just throw that shit out the window and then roll it up fast or a mexican might get in
372529 oooh and anyone else dig the evolution of art thing during the credits cave painting gt hieroglyphics gt renaissance gt impressionism gt modernisme mosaic gt
372530 same thing happened with the incredibles except it got the nutty left in a tizzy instead of the nutty right so it goes i suppose
372531 i love the incredibles but i dont think it fits too well with my worldview
372532 but the celebration of the nuclear family and traditional gender roles
372533 the fact that they made a nasty villain out of a misfit geeky kid
372534 and especially what happens to violets character at the end all kind of turn me off
372535 for a film supposedly about exceptional unique people theres a lot of stress on conformity
372536 incidentally i thought that the physical resemblance of wall e to johnny 5 was an intentional homage i mean there were little visual references to robots and computers from other sci fi films throughout the nod to 2001 was very clear for example
372537 you dont need a mouth you dont need a nose you get a whole personality just from them
372538 i wanted to see it as a machine first and as a character second
372539 i wanted to believe that a robot is really there i wanted to believe he is really a robot and not just a human in a robot shell
372540 i agree with the charges of hypocrisy i agree that the malthusian fear mongering was annoying but i saw wall e on saturday as well and i thought it was a fascinating and at times brilliant movie
372541 buy n large requires you to join our buy n large corporate street team

372544 hey this guys trying to be on our level lets get him
372545 is it wrong that after seeing that i want to go get in n out
372546 a the idea that the incredibles a mainstream animated feature was thought of as provocative was wonderful to me i was very gratified though i thought some of the analysis was really kind of goofy some pieces compared the viewpoint to the objectivist philosopher ayn rand i thought that was silly and the writers were humorless i was into rand for about six months when i was 20 but you outgrow that narrow point of view some compromise is necessary in life
372547 well none of that will matter when the rapture happens

372550 i would lose my livelihood if my fruits and vegetables started smelling like price canyon
372551 theyll have to dispose of their water are they going to be dumping it into our local streams what about the condors there are a lot of unanswered questions still
372552 i will neither confirm nor deny that im entertaining the notion to run for sheriff
372553 we all love dale hes so for his people he wants to have a good contract and the best benefits
372554 its an interesting question we havent gotten an answer to why did the army pick this particular person to name it after
372555 maybe it was the fact he sacrificed his life to save his fellow tank crewman

372557 i have a responsibility to make sure our state has enough money to pay its bills
372558 the next administration must also be ready to demand that human rights for palestinians including the freedom of movement and education are as important as israeli security
372559 just because the ua didnt make those lists doesnt mean great things arent happening there
372560 to be included at all in the book there has to be academic excellence at the school a strong admissions office lots of things
372561 theres a lot of schools that arent on any of the top 20 lists its nothing to hang your head about
372562 theyre entitled to their own opinion but i think we have the tastiest food the only thing this shows is that people were too busy enjoying our great food and amazing campus life to fill out a survey for the princeton review
372563 i think that goes to the nature of the size of asu and on the heels of quite a few athletic wins
372564 winning games goes hand in hand with partying but at ua we try to be the best for academics and outreach i have the utmost confidence in president robert shelton that even if we dont make the princeton review the quality of education and student life here at ua will remain high
372565 although its nice to be listed among the top 386 universities our aspirations are much higher
372566 you could look at various college rankings and get various results our priorities need to be about our mission of education research and outreach
372567 opening this facility is part of our strategic plan to meet the health care needs of the many people who live in the foothills area
372568 we have seen a marked increase in these graffiti tagging gangs taking to weapons and fighting to protect their walls their territory their name
372569 if we see someone calling the police then we target them
372570 you are trying to stop me from what i live what i believe in and what i breathe we are not going to let no one get in the way
372571 take a deep breath back off and call law enforcement
372572 i said if you are going to write on the wall write on your own wall

372579 it hurts me so much to miss the olympics and the u s open you have no idea
372580 you can imagine that i was not very thrilled to hear that my medical team did not see this tear in my shoulder back in april
372581 getting no 1 is a present for a lot of work in the past so its satisfying
372582 we are disappointed in this outcome but our complete review and this final decision is in the best interest of our program

372632 our research showed as far back as 2004 that provider taxonomy was going to be a key to npi implementation
372633 weve been trying to spread the word about sensible approaches to the use of taxonomy especially in regard to the various providers that may appear on claims as referring providers ordering physicians and the like weve presented at national conferences and developed publications webinars and videos on the topic but now we have come to aid our provider community more directly by actually delivering the codes they need to get claims paid by improving crosswalk profiles
372634 in the run up to the may 23 npi compliance date providers and their vendors hurried to add npi to their lookup tables even small practices may have hundreds of providers that refer patients in while hospitals will have thousands or tens of thousands a reference lab may have provider tables that exceed six figures were giving those folks a way to add accurate taxonomy values for literally pennies apiece
372635 a payer may accept claims without taxonomies or with default values provided by clearinghouses but once the claim gets through the door it may be held up for matching if the taxonomy sent does not match the payers expectations sending a taxonomy designated by the provider on their own npi record is the surest way to keep the claim from pending

373043 the lord is in charge of the beginning and the end but we are responsible for the middle
373044 when a cat is chasing a mouse there is no sense for the mouse to ask for a cease fire he must deal with the cat and insure his own safety
373045 is it your sense that israel is more secure today before we get to the point of the iran nuclear bomb than it has been in its history so far
373046 it is probable that we would have had peace if mr rabin had not been assassinated
373047 we are prepared to make a final settlement with israel
373048 we have the experience we have the knowledge we have learned from our mistakes we need no more than six months to conclude a final peace agreement with the israelis what we are going through now are labor pains
373049 you really think you are within 6 months of a deal
373050 what people dont know is that me and my israeli colleagues in the last days of the administration of israeli prime minister ehud barak drafted three chapters of a permanent status treaty
373051 you dont need to reinvent the wheel now we know what its going to take
373052 look i dont base anything on optimism or pessimism but when i say this line on behalf of my president i know what im talking about were doing this because we realize its not a zero sum game two states this is it you want it okay then lets do it
373053 israels permanent borders whereby we will completely separate from the majority of the palestinian population
373054 if we see that we do not have a partner then i think we will need to take our fate into our own hands and make a decision where it is right to be and where it is not right to be
373055 we urge mr olmert to resume permanent status negotiations with us
373056 the road to peace and security in the region is not through unilateralism the building of walls and settlements
373057 i will be the one to sign it if needed i will put it to a referendum i received 62 in the elections in which i condemned violence outspokenly i m certain that i will also succeed in getting a majority for a peace agreement
373058 according to the oslo accords we were supposed to reach a final status agreement by may 1999 and we saw what happened
373059 yitzhak rabin was assassinated shimon peres lost the lections and benjamin netanyahu destroyed everything i m proposing to you to sit now and discuss the end the conflict i have proposed to shimon peres and the americans to open a back channel of talks for form the spotlight and i am convinced that we will be able to sign an agreement
373060 this idea could really be the light at the end of the tunnel
373061 a palestinian state alone is not going to be viable but a confederation with jordan will give palestinians the prospect of being part of a truly functioning and successful state it will give jordanians assurance that the west bank wont become a breeding ground for radicals and militants and it will give the israelis the assurance that jordan will help maintain internal security as well as a security otherwise the palestinians will never get a state

373083 ich glaube das hat mit einem gewissen weiblichen selbstbewusstsein zu tun
373084 ich kleide mich gern l ssig aber nie nachl ssig

373088 man kann in so eine figur abtauchen und sich von seiner fantasie davontragen lassen
373089 i got to bring my own jacob so it was like perfect timing
373090 relieved but feels that it never should have come to this that cuban had withheld this money really out of spite and it was just unnecessary
373091 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode
373092 the entire world is looking for a way to sucker punch us
373093 national security is absolutely at the top of the list of issues thats why i think john mccain is the guy to keep us safe
373094 the figure is still quite impressive and i estimate this will rise substantially in the next few years
373095 i numeri primi sono divisibili soltanto per 1 e per se stessi
373096 sono contento per come stanno andando le cose la prima parte della preparazione stata svolta dai miei giocatori con giudizio ed applicazione questo un buon gruppo e tra conferme e nuovi arrivi esiste gi una buona sintonia e ovvio che dobbiamo migliorare su alcuni aspetti perch nel calcio la perfezione non esiste
373097 grazie di esistere grazie di quello che fai grazie di come sei
373098 they can move back in but we suggested they wait until the end of the weekend because were a bit uncertain about what this weather bomb that comes through tonight is going to be like
373099 if the slip were to start again we wouldnt want to put them at risk
373100 that being the case the people up the top probably wouldnt move back in until that work was done
373101 the poles have eased and are on a bit of a slope
373102 im a real down to earth guy thats had a lot of problems in my life since birth
373103 i am a complicated guy theres too much to tell either love me or hate me but either way im me
373104 yeah its true it was me that cut the two girls but dat was a long time ago i have changed i just want a good life from now on and another chance
373105 this is the peoples house this is not pelosis politiburo
373106 the fact that democrats left before getting their work done is highly disappointing
373107 we can sustain this weve been in dispute for a week and there has been action every day in most departments
373108 were really geared up for the weekend its a big weekend in sky city because of the bledisloe cup and its absolutely business as usual
373109 regardless of law marriage has only one definition and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy i will act to destroy that government and bring it down so it can be replaced with a government that will respect and support marriage and help me raise my children in a society where they will expect to marry in their turn
373110 when i was an undergraduate theatre student i was aware and not happily so how pervasive was the reach of the underculture of homosexuality among my friends and acquaintances after a while i stopped being shocked to discover that someone i had known well or whose talent i admired was either moving into or already a part of the not so clandestine network of gay relationships

373133 well not too good i just had to decided to feed little bobby today and not susan cause i dont have enough food for the both of em and susan died on us
373134 hmmm horrible way to die starvation terrible pain to go through for poor little susan but hey youre not alone neighbor and i understand your difficulty there why just earlier i had to decide whether or not to bathe today i opted not to tough one there huh
373135 what the fuck are you talking about by the way you smell like shit im going to go mourn my child now selfish asshole
373136 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
373137 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
373138 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
373139 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
373140 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
373141 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
373142 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
373143 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
373144 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
373145 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
373146 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
373147 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
373148 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
373149 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
373150 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
373151 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
373152 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
373153 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
373154 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
373155 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
373156 o coi sempre foi muito claro no sentido de que queremos todo acesso de internet para voc s jornalistas trabalharem livremente isso est claro para n s
373157 estou treinando muito bem agora meus advers rios n o me preocupam sigo meu pr prio caminho
373158 espero que possa conquistar a medalha de ouro nos 100 metros para isso que estou aqui
373159 sempre tive falc es gavi es e corujas tratava elas e depois soltava procurei uma especializa o na argentina e mais tarde conseguiu uma autoriza o do ibama para prestar essa ajuda na recupera o das aves de rapina
373160 o brasil riqu ssimo em aves de rapina a maior do mundo brasileira a rpia
373161 este um problema em aeroportos do mundo todo e o falc o uma t cnica muito boa para ajudar nisso
373162 o tiro com arco ajuda a manter o foco no que se est fazendo o que muitas vezes falta na vida profissional procuro usar a mesma t cnica do esporte na minha vida
373163 muito dif cil ter essas duas atividades t o espec ficas o tiro com arco um esporte caro e sem patroc nio a falcoaria ainda esta engatinhando no pa s
373164 era um arco de m qualidade e n o me levou a lugar nenhum logo na primeira semana quebrei a maioria das flechas
373165 sempre gostei bastante do esporte mas comecei tarde com 26 anos teoricamente tarde mas o resultado foi muito r pido
373166 se eu n o tivesse essa meta clara eu teria desistido antes
373167 j uma vitoria ter conseguido vir para a olimp ada conquistar uma medalha dif cil mas n o imposs vel
373168 this is a moment that ive been looking forward to for many many years because we have such a legacy and history together that we couldnt escape it even if we tried
373169 weve had the younger audience all along every time they get to that certain age they go through that cheech amp chong period of watching the movies listening to the records so its almost like a rite of passage
373170 what happens if you dont have big problems like trying to make it when thats cured when youve made it then your little problems become your big problems
373171 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
373172 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
373173 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
373174 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
373175 abc news claim which they said came at first from
373176 its extremely possible one could say highly likely that the same people responsible for perpetrating the attacks were the ones who fed the false reports to the public through abc news that saddam was behind them what we know for certain as a result of the letters accompanying the anthrax is that whoever perpetrated the attacks wanted the public to believe they were sent by foreign muslims feeding claims to abc news designed to link saddam to those attacks would for obvious reasons promote the goal of the anthrax attacker s
373177 see this important point from atrios about richard cohens admission that he was told before the anthrax attacks happened by a
373178 now that we know that the us govt believes that anthrax came from the inside shouldnt cohen be a wee bit curious about what this warning was based on
373179 abc news is deleting any mention of my piece today in the comment section to their article on the ivins suicide
373180 the iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade
373181 ivins local paper frederick news in maryland has printed several letters to the editor written by ivins over the years though the underlying ideology is a bit difficult to discern he seems clearly driven by a belief in the need for christian doctrine to govern our laws and political institutions with a particular interest in catholic dogma
373182 i am a sinner and i am going straight to hell
373183 you know what would be better then standing and having this motorized thing push me around sitting and having some motorized thing push me around
373184 and why go outside at all i have everything i need from the internet
373185 why use up all that energy getting out of bed i can just have images and feeling beamed into my bed with me new ilive
373186 we have a no media policy because the media are not considered individuals it is a concern that people from the media will not respect peoples consent or consensus
373187 the secret worlds of shoplifters rioters dropouts deserters adulterers vandals daydreamers converge to form gateways to new worlds where theft cheating warfare boredom and so on are simply obsolete
373188 i dont know what theyre doing back there but it seemed so far theres no disturbance
373189 kto publicznie zniewa a prezydenta rzeczypospolitej polskiej podlega karze pozbawienia wolno ci do lat 3

373221 plastics packaging waste in particular is a very visible part of the waste stream and its also growing
373222 ironically as we become more successful at recycling generally whats left in the bin tends to be just the plastic so more and more people are looking in their bins and saying theres just bits of plastic here why cant i recycle them
373223 a lot of packaging is designed to lengthen the shelf life of the products that are being sold so if you take it out of the packaging theres a good chance that it will actually not last as long
373224 and unless youre very very disciplined and most of us frankly arent then youre quite likely to end up by throwing more food away
373225 the government and all of us should be joyful because this is something that must be defended something that our children and grandchildren will depend on for their livelihood

373231 we want the sovereignty that we hold over amazonian territory and the decisions that are made in this region to be respected
373232 the fund is a vehicle by which foreign governments can help support our initiatives without exerting any influence over our national policy
373233 for a long time brazil was violently opposed to this insisting fossil fuel was to blame
373234 thats true historically speaking but today forests play an important role
373235 we are committed to reducing the destruction of the rainforest to eliminating illegal burning and to guaranteeing a better quality of life for all
373236 our war is not won by simply reducing illegal burning in one month it will be won once this environmental model that is destroying our communities and biodiversity is history
373237 the return of the north aral sea shows that man made disasters can be at least partly reversed and that food production depends on the sound management of scarce water resources and the environment

373291 well about a year ago i received an income tax check in my mailbox for a friend of mine that was fighting in viet nam i held on to it for awhile then one day a buddy came over to my house and we managed to get it cashed at my bank
373292 why did you do a stupid idiotic thing like that
373293 because i was broke and hungry i think those are two pretty good reasons
373294 no they gave me the option of going down to l a tomorrow on my own accord
373295 well it looks like we are both taking tomorrow off from work then

373304 mr miller this is a serious offense i dont know what you were thinking but i think you know now it was wrong because you have no prior criminal record and you are employed and have a place to live i am going to sentence you to three years probation as well as a 1000 dollar fine and you are to pay back james colton 500 for his income tax refund
373305 officer ive been in here since 2 00p m waiting to be released can you find out what the problem is

373311 to have real gospel transformation you must have true community as well as solid theology behind your relationship with christ but you also need service when you dont have good deeds along with community and theology its like youre missing the other half of making it as easy as possible for people to do projects within a one mile radius of sojourn as well as intentional relationships in the larger city of louisville and international seed with mission trips like those to sudan with nadus films were just trying to make it as easy as possible to plug in and not have to do any planning or preparation just sign up online on seeds website and then show up you work an hour or two hours and every little bit makes change our whole goal with seed is to glorify god and make disciples the only way we can do that is by building relationships over time picking up trash may not seem like a big deal but when you have forty sojourners every month picking up trash and the neighbors see you pick up trash month after month they realize that its sojourn that sojourn does this for them to serve them then they turn around and get a knock on their door and theres another sojourner to check their gutters its just one thing after another you may not feel the benefits or the power of the gospel while youre picking up trash but thats exactly what seed is all about you are planting a seed for another sojourner to later get into someones life in the neighborhood and watch that seed grow
373312 although i have believed in christ for a long time each day i am still learning more about what it means to believe to trust to obey to love and to hope my journey began the first time i was baptized my parents baptized me as an infant making a promise to raise me according to the scriptures and under the lordship of christ and they indeed played a significant role in my faith development i still remember one night as a young boy getting out of bed late at night and sitting on my fathers lap asking him questions about how i could ever know i was saved my faith grew through participation in young life during high school where i finally began to understand gods grace as a freely given gift through jesus christ rather than something i could earn through my own performance when i understood gods grace for the first time i was flooded with relief and tears of gratitude and could for the first time confess that jesus truly was and is my savior and my only true hope since that time my life has often mirrored the pattern of the israelites in the old testament god called them provided for them and met their every need although they were typically grateful for a brief time they would eventually forget turn away and fall into sin despite their rebellion our gracious god would rescue them and the whole process would start again like the israelites of the old testament i forget get distracted by the things of this world and fall into a trap of trying to perform and like them i desperately need christ because i cant rescue myself i needed christ when i was born i needed him upon my first belief in him and i still need him just as much today as i stand before you publicly professing my faith through baptism thankfully he has always called me back and has surrounded me with brothers and sisters who continue to walk with me through both the seeking and the sinning for better or worse i have sometimes found clarity to be elusive many of those close to me know that ive turned round and round again on whether i should be baptized a second time i might still be turning but his grace god has given me clarity on two important truths and of these i am certain first i need christ more than i need clarity and i strongly desire to be identified with him because he is my only true hope and comfort in life and death second sojourn is my church home i am precisely where god has led me and somehow despite my imperfection and sinfulness i desire to seek him and follow him along with all of you my brothers and sisters in christ you have taken me in as your brother in christ and i dont need to perform any longer because gods grace has filled our lives we are free thanks be to god
373313 to have real gospel transformation you must have true community as well as solid theology behind your relationship with christ but you also need service when you dont have good deeds along with community and theology its like youre missing the other half
373314 this was my first time trying out a seed project and i really enjoyed it one really cool thing happened i was talking with a deacon at bates and he asked me if i would like to join in on prayer with two homeless people of course i said yes then about five of us volunteers one homeless man and one homeless woman held hands in a circle the deacon looked to me asking me to lead us in prayer so i gladly prayed for the program and especially for the two individuals there it was a beautiful time gods grace was tangible the homeless man got teary eyed and i got to hug him it was something small but i know that god is working in their lives it was cool i definitely plan on helping out more
373315 although i have believed in christ for a long time each day i am still learning more about what it means to believe to trust to obey to love and to hope my journey began the first time i was baptized my parents baptized me as an infant making a promise to raise me according to the scriptures and under the lordship of christ and they indeed played a significant role in my faith development
373316 i come from a long line of strong and faithful christians my dad is a pastor my grandparents were missionaries and my great grandfather was also a pastor needless to say from the time i was born i was brought up in the teachings of gods word i had a constant model of what it meant to walk with the lord daily in elementary school i accepted the lord into my life
373317 theres a lot of what they call buzz going around in the blogosphere right now that barack obama will choose the governor of virginia this guy tim kaine to be his running mate
373318 polls show that barack obama is more popular than john mccain in germany france and great britain however john mccain leads in mesopotamia gaul and the holy roman empire
373319 heard about this group called prayer at the pump there are prayer groups that are springing up and they go to gas stations and they hold hands and they pray for lower gas prices otherwise known as the bush energy plan
373320 barack obama made a big announcement barack obama announced that next month he wants to spend a week on vacation in hawaii
373321 hillary clinton is trying to retire her campaign debt so shes giving everyone who donates money a chance to have dinner with her yeah no word yet on what the winner gets
373322 nation ive got great news i am furious today alaska senator ted stevens was unfairly indicted by the justice department just because the oilfield company veco didnt charge him for an extensive renovation on his house including a brand new first floor a fully finished basement a wrap around deck and one assumes installing the latest internet tubes the justice department is calling this a conflict of interest please veco is a major oil drilling company and senator stevens worked tirelessly to allow drilling in anwr thats not a conflict of interest their interests line up perfectly this is a non story folks and i look forward to stevens being proven innocent when president bush commutes his sentence
373323 nation i am still furious that alaska republican senator ted stevens was indicted yesterday on charges that he improperly received gifts from oil field giant veco it was not improper senator stevens received those gifts very properly he even sent them a thank you note thanks for doing over 250 000 worth of renovations to my house and not charging me for it sincerely senator ted stevens the guy was raised right is that suddenly a crime
373324 the latest politic gossip is that hillary clinton is not particularly high on barack obamas vice presidential list in fact turns out shes somewhere between the reverend wright and jesse jackson
373325 it looks like hillary clinton still has a shot at being vice president yeah if john mccain picks her
373326 well yesterday congress officially apologized for slavery not a moment too soon huh you hate to see these things fester until theres a lot of animosity thank god they nipped it in the bud like that
373327 barack obama says that next month hes planning on spending a week on vacation in hawaii
373328 time magazine says that many top republicans are worried that lately john mccain has been taking too negative a tone when he heard this mccain said shut your piehole good for him
373329 and this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations and then the end will come
373330 he has showed you o man what is good and what does the lord require of you to act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your god
373331 i am a serious foodie an avid gardener and a crazed entrepreneur
373332 written in an appealing rhythmic rhyme which makes this profound theological concept seem simple and child appropriate the pictures are simple and childish without trying to be overly cute i appreciate the simplicity
373333 this book is a great introduction to the practice of family worship and how the church and the home are interrelated
373334 this is an excellent book and i have already begun looking for a way to get a copy into the hands of every family at our church
373335 gods work of change has relationships both as the necessary means and a wonderful goal humble community is not the icing on the cake of christianity in a real way it is the cake these relationships of love are a means of personal growth a mark of gods people being purified and a clear argument to the world for the truth of the gospel
373336 i come from a long line of strong and faithful christians
373337 in the same way faith by itself if it is not accompanied by action is dead
373338 go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you
373339 yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth for they are the kind of worshipers the father seeks god is spirit and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth
373340 man i only watch tv once a week and its great time to build friendships with these amazing people and mike said

373343 to have real gospel transformation you must have true community as well as solid theology behind your relationship with christ but you also need service when you dont have good deeds along with community and theology its like youre missing the other half
373344 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
373345 not only did we play the race card we dealt it from the bottom of the deck
373346 a mans greatest care should be for that place where he dwells longest therefore eternity should be his scope
373347 what does god say about my loneliness and my condition
373348 everyone has been asking me what i have been thinking about what sort of results i am going to get and i really think we could have been in the top ten
373349 it is gutting for me and the team so to be let down by an accident before the weekend is such a shame
373350 there were a few older bikes at mallory and it is the same old story when you get those sort of bikes because you get leaks and mishaps every now and again
373351 basically the bike slipped on some kind of lubricant and low sided but then it caught grip picked me up and sent me flying off into the air and behind the trees it was a big crash so i am pleased to have not come away with any broken bones
373352 jeg kan sige s meget at der er interesse fra klubber b de i ind og udland det har der v ret l nge br ndby har ogs vist interesse men vi har ikke direkte forhandlinger med br ndby
373353 we are who we are today because of our people its as simple as that
373354 if we continue to grow at our current pace well need new leaders leaders who live and breathe our almost 100 year old philosophy of leadership design excellence and client satisfaction with culture and continuity being so important it makes sense to invest in ourselves and promote from within our people help ensure our future

373357 they planned and conducted the sting operation only to embarrass the government
373358 the upa and the sp resorted to blatant abuse of power and abominable malpractices to win
373359 they stooped to the same low level as the right wing bharatiya janata party does this has discredited them significantly in the eyes of the public
373360 worse the upa suborned the office of the lok sabha lower house speaker who belongs to the communist party of india marxist cpi m which is opposed to the nuclear deal and voted against the government they put pressure on him to continue as speaker although his party was opposed to this and thus weakened his authority
373361 the charge is probably true that the sp tried to bribe at least one of the three mps who then roped in the other two and set up a sting operation with the help of the television channel to deceive the sp
373362 that means the bribed bjp mps were no innocents or hapless victims of machiavellian manipulation of the kind amar singh is known for they planned and conducted the sting operation only to embarrass the government
373363 singh has a reputation not only for never having sullied his hands in murky politics and shady deals but also for having never encouraged his colleagues to do so but in this case he was certainly complicit in the upas questionable tactics to secure support by whatever means
373364 the significance of this degeneration lies not just in the unethical character of the votes rationale but more importantly in the non representative nature of the choices made within the context of party based democracy without any reference to the peoples will the confidence vote has set indian democracy back
373365 it is promoting utterly unscrupulous and unprincipled political alliances which have no common ground in policies programmes and priorities this blurring of the lines of political demarcation will result in the bjp becoming disproportionately important as a party with a distinct identity this doesnt bode well for diversity and plurality in the political system which is essential in a one billion plus country
373366 the bill will enable the government to raise fdi in insurance from 26 per cent to 49 per cent the focus will now be on greater liberalisation
373367 we have been fighting for many years now we need time to get back together as a family we also hope the police will look further into the matter of jill dando
373368 we are disappointed by todays verdict but especially disappointed for jills family and friends however we respect the decision of the court
373369 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
373370 harriet miers is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena
373371 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
373372 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
373373 i have not yet talked with anyone at the white house and dont expect that this matter will be finally resolved in the very near future
373374 if the administration appeals the ruling our congressional prerogatives will once again be put at risk
373375 we look forward to the white house complying with this ruling and to scheduling future hearings with ms miers and other witnesses who have relied on such claims
373376 we hope that the defendants will accept this decision and expect that we will receive relevant documents and call ms miers to testify in september
373377 we have not heard from cambridge it is a case of waiting to hear from them now we have done all we can
373378 the new players have settled in well which is a credit to the players already at the club i think if i can get a couple more new faces to complement that and add to the competition for places then i will be happy
373379 i will be having another look at jamie hand and kwesi appiah who came from the youth team and has looked good in the games he has played
373380 we do have a lot more depth compared to last season and you need that we had the budget increase and i was not going to spend that all on one player but instead on a number of players to give us more depth and have cover for all positions
373381 to be honest liam did not have to do a lot to persuade me to sign for ebbsfleet it was a decision that was easy for me i wanted to get back into full time football and there is a great young team here under a young manager i can see us going places i cant wait to impress the fans and they should expect goals
373382 wal mart stores inc is mobilizing its store managers and department supervisors around the country to warn that if democrats win power in november theyll likely change federal law to make it easier for workers to unionize companies including wal mart in recent weeks thousands of wal mart store managers and department heads have been summoned to mandatory meetings at which the retailer stresses the downside for workers if stores were to be unionized according to about a dozen wal mart employees who attended such meetings in seven states wal mart executives claim that employees at unionized stores would have to pay hefty union dues while getting nothing in return and may have to go on strike without compensation also unionization could mean fewer jobs as labor costs rise
373383 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union

373386 i will firmly take emergency measures for people who are seriously affected by abnormal oil prices
373387 i will also carry out flexible economic management by closely watching prices of commodities
373388 based on the firm alliance between japan and the united states i will contribute to the formation of open diplomacy in order to work together with asia pacific countries
373389 we hope he will tackle pressing policy issues head on and show bold leadership when implementing policy
373390 the prime minister is standing on an extremely severe position
373391 i think in the current socioeconomic situation its the time to carry out policies
373392 peoples concerns about oil and food prices continue to grow while he has to show responsible prospects for social security and tax reforms
373393 we want to pay attention to the positive impact of aso who is said to be popular on his administration
373394 the referendum does not solve anything it just offers the prospect of a new election
373395 this will make mps more responsible towards the voters this will give us an instrument to hold parliament to account
373396 the possibility of dismissing parliament would stand as a warning to mps that they have to take public views into account
373397 parliament is elected once every four years and has to work during that time

373402 hello christian community and all others who might be interested in an understanding of daniels last 4 visions
373403 then some of the pharisees and teachers of the law said to him teacher we want to see a miraculous sign from you
373404 when he had received the drink jesus said it is finished with that he bowed his head and gave up his spirit 31 now it was the day of preparation and the next day was to be a because the jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the sabbath they asked pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down
373405 later joseph of arimathea asked pilate for the body of jesus now joseph was a disciple of jesus but secretly because he feared the jews with pilates permission he came and took the body away 39 he was accompanied by nicodemus the man who earlier had visited jesus at night nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about seventy five pounds 40 taking jesus body the two of them wrapped it with the spices in strips of linen this was in accordance with jewish burial customs 41 at the place where jesus was crucified there was a garden and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid 42 because it was the jewish day of preparation and since the tomb was nearby they laid jesus there
373406 it was the day of preparation of passover week about the sixth hour
373407 for as jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish so the son of man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth
373408 from that time on jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders chief priests and teachers of the law and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life

373685 in poland in recent years there has been this awakening taking place where more and more people are discovering their jewish roots
373686 many jews who survived the war and chose to remain in poland because of the persecution they faced decided to hide their identity now that poland has become a democracy and its society has begun to open up people feel freer to identify as jews we are seeing this incredible phenomenon of the hidden jews of poland emerging from the shadows
373687 shavei israel has the idea that people who have jewish roots should receive an equal opportunity to decide whether they want to be jewish or not it is not their fault that they are not jewish in the sociological sense of being jewish

373696 we got together and were interested in fine coffee from our college years and work experience we had a foundation with some established skills we had high interest and were willing to take a risk we knew we would have to work hard to get a good organic product
373697 we came to leeds by accident someone mentioned there was a building in leeds we soon discovered the facility was already approved by the health department and this made the decision of location an easy one so much of the leg work was already established we were ready to get started roasting
373698 it is the second most tradable commodity in the world next to only petroleum it is also the second most consumable beverage after water over half the population of the planet consumes coffee with this much recognition you can do so much with the product
373699 organically produced products ensures the safety of the workers the environment as well as the overall safety for the consumer chemicals that we find on the standard mass produced coffee bean are somewhere between the second or third worse chemicals consumed in the world

373709 when ive convinced the baron to support us i want my old rank back
373710 hopefully your mission will be a success and we can afford to get you better equipped
373711 do not worry if the baron agrees to fight for us or even to simply offer financial backing then all will be forgiven
373712 roger i am going to disengage from active control of your mind and continue meditating so i can shield you from the baron should he prove to be hostile call me if you run into any banshees or other fey folk we dont think the host could afford to supply fey mercs to keep the baron in check but seeing as they hold dublin and iona anything is possible ill keep a slight mental monitor going though so if i sense anything i can warn you

373722 your fear is delicious let me taste it and i will tell
373723 roger i am dropping the barrier take your voice box off line we dont want any errant screams attracting unwanted guests
373724 now i have the strength my mind is lucid but not for long i can create a portal to where they are keeping the baron i cannot go the necromancers that keep him chained they will surely banish me then i could no longer serve
373725 the pain of death is better than the pain of damnation we serve the baron because the alternative is far worse now come i have not much time before i lose my mind again
373726 the king desires your power and he always gets what he wants maybe hell let me play with you a bit as a reward
373727 weve danced this dance before i am not one to fall prey to your seduction and it is only your necromancers holding me here that stops me from killing you
373728 baron it is only my necromancers here that stops the tainted king from simply twisting you to his bidding bowing to him of your own free will no matter how grudgingly will save you from a life of slavery i believe youll be much more useful if you can think for yourself and king kaledros trusts my judgement i know youll crack one day once the hunger becomes too much
373729 you can smell my blood pulsing just beneath my skin if you give in now you can have me

373731 you have no idea what this is like you could not possibly want this
373732 you brought a sonic blade yes give it to me
373733 i am quite unimpressed with the state of my castle so you are going to do something for me you are to go to the tainted king kaledros and tell him that i find his so called army laughable
373734 your siege was broken by no more than myself and one representative of the red ruin army
373735 now that is what i call power you would never have caught me to begin with if you hadnt bribed that nixie to keep putting running water in my way then catching me out after sunrise you will pay now get out of my sight
373736 the world is changing rhianna kasik i thought to remain out of it autonomous to the end i never wanted to be caught up in this war

373743 a little bit of money from a lot of people can create a big change
373744 apparently someone going over the books realized there was some money missing and they reported it to their supervisors
373745 what it will do is allow us to capitalize on some of the things that the city already has in place
373746 we have better highways we have the zoo a pottery festival that draws people to our area we need to capitalize on that and make the most of it
373747 about three quarters of a million people come to the zoo every year
373748 when they do they tend to spend roundabout 40 to 45 dollars a day somewhere between 50 to 60 million dollars a year spins off into the local economy meals gas some hotels and some other retail
373749 to do the zoo properly you really need to be here for at least a day and a half
373750 if you can encourage people to stay the night their spending goes to about 145 a day
373751 this area has a real need for a good four star hotel and more three star hotels
373752 with that comes the real opportunity for a convention center here as well
373753 the idea has been out there for quite some time
373754 but partly because of the alcohol business we havent been able to move that forward

373759 the unwritten rule is never go into the gorge alone
373760 something like that gives you an appreciation for the human spirit and what people can do when they are given a choice to live or die
373761 based upon the circumstances with which corporal schultheis was confronted that morning he reasonably believed the decedents aggressive actions represented a deadly threat to himself and that corporal schultheis use of deadly force under those circumstances was justified
373762 he can get back to serving the men and women of greensboro
373763 while the death of mr paschal is certainly regrettable officer schultheis was left with no choice but to do what he did that night
373764 were happy that after a thorough investigation that the district attorney has agreed his actions were lawful
373765 that the foregoing events occurred in the predawn darkness with the only source of light being the blue lights of the officers patrol car and the decedents right hand was still concealed inside the waistband of his pants when ems personnel arrived at the scene
373766 why should he get a plea bargain for what he did to her
373767 he may have spent the rest of his life wondering wheres my daughters body
373768 the only way to get that answer was from decarlo bennett
373769 were trying to save the victims to come so to speak

373773 the county commissioners will do something and they wont even look over at us and those so called meet and greets between the city council and county commissioners are a joke
373774 now in charlotte its more ill pull up my sleeve you pull up your sleeve and its ok if we get pissed at one another
373775 were too polite we dont get down to the nitty gritty
373776 i grew up reading about how bad things are and how greensboro cant do anything and all that stuff
373777 but at the end of the day our elected leaders are our employees and if we can light a fire under them then well see some action
373778 its our job to build the kind of city we want to stay in
373779 claim it go after it do it dont let people dwell on they can do it because they are charlotte syndrome the 101 principles are the same

373794 they didnt fully understand the terms was wrongly told they could refinance after a year and was on the verge of losing their company of 39 years because of unaffordable payments

373845 there was a dozen ideas proffered how to trigger a war the one that interested me the most was why don t we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and the next time one of our boats goes through the straits of hormuz start a shoot up might cost some lives and it was rejected because you can t have americans killing americans but that s the kind of that s the level of stuff we are talking about provocation but that was rejected

374071 i just submitted an application requesting to the pre trial chamber number three to issue an arrest warrant against omar hassan ahmad al bashir for genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes
374072 lets not be naive its not going to happen in the next couple of days thats clear to us but its not the first time that a head of state sitting head of state has been indicted you will remember the examples of slobodan milosevic in 99 or taylor in 2001 who was also the sitting president of liberia at the time they were not arrested immediately but eventually when the international community threw its weight behind these arrest warrants
374073 to have the federal government disappear your marriage im sure will be painful and upsetting it really is something out of orwell its shameful

374078 as you know fannie mae and freddie mac play a central role in our housing finance system and must continue to do so in their current form as shareholder owned companies their support for the housing market is particularly important as we work through the current housing correction
374079 we need more troops more helicopters better intelligence gathering and more nonmilitary assistance to accomplish the mission there
374080 john mccain and george bush both said that if iraq as a sovereign government stated that it was time for us to start withdrawing our troops then they would respect the wishes of that sovereign government and given that i think its also in our strategic interests it certainly strikes me that we shouldnt be writing a status of forces agreement for example that locks in a long term occupation
374081 its 7 00 in the morning its time for him to get up smell the coffee and know the american people are sick and tired of war were already in one quagmire in iraq we dont want another one in iran
374082 and when i got to washington i saw that public policy is really made in a room at a table there were real seats at the table well imagine what has happened to public policymaking now there is a real room with a window and a door and theres two seats at the table the window is for us to look through while our representatives make policy for us so we can see what theyre doing at the table one seat is for the democrats one seat is for the republicans now we dont know who did it but one of them put a lock on the door and slipped a key to the corporate lobbyists who can come and go at will and whisper what they want to democrats and republicans and the result is that we the people who pay for those seats and determine who sits in them want one thing but because the corporate lobbyists can come and go at will our values get overridden and our representatives give us something else thats how we end up with everyone saying theyre against the war and occupation but war and occupation still gets funding thats how we end up with everyone saying theyre against illegal spying on innocent people yet end up with a telecom immunity bill being signed into law thats how we end up with everyone saying theyre in favor of universal access to healthcare and no one supporting what the physicians nurses and healthcare really want and thats a single payer healthcare system in this country

374088 what is your position on senator dodds pledge to filibuster a bill that contains retroactive immunity
374089 oh theres good faith reasons not to impeach or to criminally prosecute
374090 well there may be legal excuses as to why he did that
374091 well these are important intellectual issues that we need to grapple with and its really not fair to put them inside of a courtroom or talk about prison

374094 this is a guarantee to keep any more worker safety regulation from ever coming out this is being done in secrecy to be sprung before president bush leaves office to cripple the next administration
374095 what i think can change is the ability of the united states government and a united states president to be actively engaged with the peace process and to be concerned and recognize the legitimate difficulties that the palestinian people are experiencing right now and recognize that it is not only in the interest of the palestinian people that their situation improves i believe its also in the interest of the israeli people because it is going to be very difficult for israel ever to feel secure if you dont have some sense of opportunity and prosperity and stability with its its neighbors
374096 its the credibility of the us the interest of the us has been adversely all affected by the last three years of american policy that has wreaked havoc in the region we need re engagement but we need positive re engagement in ways that would curb israeli violations and would help produce a just and genuine peace
374097 why have we come to rely on private contractors to provide combat or combat related security training for our forces
374098 mr hamdan or any accused at guantanamo but for right now mr hamdan if he is convicted he will stay at guantanamo bay if he is acquitted completely hell stay at guantanamo bay and if hes convicted and he gets lets say time served hes going to stay at guantanamo bay because the government has stated through their prosecutor mr murphy that regardless of what outcome in this case theyre allowed to detain mr hamdan for the duration of the global war on terrorism
374099 were in danger of losing our country to a war based on lies to destruction of our civil liberties but its your commitment and your willingness to stand up and speak out that has enabled me to take a stand and to say not only are we going to save whats right and save whats dear to us but were going to hold this administration accountable so that it never happens again
374100 theres no question about it wall street got one of the reasons i asked you to turn off the tv cameras it got drunk and now its got a hangover the question is how long will it sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments and then we got a housing issue not in houston and evidently not in dallas because lauras over there trying to buy a house i like crawford but unfortunately after eight years of asking her to sacrifice im now no longer the decision maker

374103 we were trying to get to the bulldozers we were risking no one and it seems that with the return to tactics and strategies of the first intifada by this village and the movement against the wall it seems that the army is returning to the old commands as well of breaking arms and legs of demonstrators
374104 im here visiting with the good people of nilin on this the fourth anniversary of the landmark advisory opinion and ruling by the international court of justice ruling which as you all know requires cessation of building of the wall destroying or removing the part of it that had been built and also dealing with the issue as a form of colonization and settlement activity with all that comes with that with all that comes with that by way of violation of rights of palestinians including importantly human rights
374105 were very pleased that the judge recognized on the record that my father is neither a threat to the community nor a flight risk we are hoping that immigration and customs enforcement will do the right thing and release him
374106 im not going to retract any of it every word i said was true
374107 we are also sending a message to iran that we will defend american interests and defend the interests of our allies weve done that both by i think you know that in the gulf area the united states has enhanced its security capacity its security presence and we are working closely with all of our allies to make certain that they are capable of defending themselves and we take very very strongly our obligation to help our allies defend themselves and no one should be confused about that

374110 i would tell you about my knee injury and i would tell you about my ptsd but no one here cares
374111 you know how you deal with your ptsd you go to iraq and you kill those savages

374123 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
374124 us presidential candidate barack obama talks about sixteen months that we think would be the right time frame for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes
374125 artificially prolonging the tenure of us troops in iraq would cause problems
374126 sen obama conveyed that he is committed to supporting afghanistan and to continue the war against terrorism with vigor
374127 to see young people like this who are doing such excellent work with so much dedication and pride just makes me feel good about the country and i want to make sure that everybody back home understands how much pride people take in their work here and how much sacrifice people are making its outstanding
374128 the situation is getting worse here even worse than iraq if the us government sends more troops here the violence will increase for example when we see a group of us soldiers walking here it doesnt make us feel safe our afghan forces are capable enough to ensure the security of afghanistan the us government should focus on other needs of afghans not the military
374129 there have not been any changes to the lives of ordinary afghans the visits and presence of foreigners has not changed the lives of poor afghans i returned from iran after twenty years there i had the best life when i was in iran now i have work like an animal in my country in order to feed my family my life is worse now what is the benefit of these western officials coming and going
374130 you said he was the most extreme member of the senate i think is the quote

374134 i know going awol was wrong but i thought it was the best way to stop the small kill teams

374138 as part of the war on terror for the first time in its history the united states has sanctioned government officials to physically and psychologically torment american held captives making torture the official law of the land in all but name
374139 bad news the reason were not getting better intelligence part of the reasoning anyway is that about a third of the people are innocent
374140 do you know anything about islamic radicals do you speak arabic have you got any background in this area
374141 the allegation that i provided assistance in the process of torture is completely false
374142 i gave a three hour lecture sponsored by sere the survival evasion resistance escape branch of the american armed forces at the san diego naval base in may 2002
374143 i have not worked under government contract or any other contract on any aspect of interrogation or any aspect of torture
374144 i have had no contact at all with the american psychological association about their relevant policies most importantly i strongly disapprove of torture and have never and would never provide assistance in its process
374145 if psychologists have to be there in order to keep detainees from being killed then those conditions are so horrendous that the only moral and ethical thing to do is to protest by leaving
374146 i am ashamed we are even having this conversation of course waterboarding is torture
374147 if it was done to me i would think it was torture
374148 you know you may acknowledge these laws or not but these laws exist
374149 are there weapons of mass destruction in iraq and are there connections between al qaeda and saddam hussein
374150 were better than this this is wrong were not going to do this

374157 the new president who will replace president bush is not going to change his policy in iraq his policy will remain the same regarding the occupation and iraq will see no change i do not think that he is going to change anything because the us policy is clear to everyone
374158 if the iraqi government were to say if you were president we want a timetable for troops being removed would you agree to that
374159 ive been there too many times ive met too many times with him and i know what they want they want it based on conditions and of course theyd like to have us out thats what happens when you win wars
374160 mukasey is asking congress to expand and extend the war on terror forever anyone that this president or the next one declares to be a terrorist could then be held indefinitely without a trial
374161 he is charged with genocide complicity to commit genocide murder extermination cruel treatment torture etc its a huge array of crimes committed in bosnia and herzegovina solely between march and december 1992 when bosnians serb republic was declared and radovan karadzic was its president but also for the crimes that were committed in the country from 92 until november 1995 including the genocide in srebrenica
374162 if he is guilty he has to be arrested but he is less guilty than others but they are not arrested only serbs are being arrested
374163 as we sign this memorandum of understanding we all commit ourselves to the first tentative step towards searching for a solution to the country that is in a crisis
374164 highly coercive environments and conditions under which they were made
374165 i crossed an artificial line today because appalachia is my homeland and its life is being destroyed far faster than it can regenerate
374166 they handcuffed me and placed me under the sun for about three hours then they picked me up walked me for a little bit and shot at me i found myself on the ground they told me we are going to fire a rubber bullet at you and i did not imagine that this is how they were going to act to open fire at me while i am handcuffed
374167 this policy should be condemned internationally through human rights organizations and they should be punished via an international court and not an israeli court at the end of the day they will be released the officer after a month or two or a short period he is in prison in front of the media but not in reality
374168 seamus has done so much work organising events as a member of astronomy ireland and the interest is growing all the time

374170 lo nico que puedo decir sobre las negociaciones es que el benfica efectivamente ha hecho una oferta por luis garc a y que de esta oferta no vamos a salir no queremos alargar demasiado la operaci n
374171 todo el mundo sabe que el a o pasado tuvimos problemas y nos falt gol el jueves tuvimos cuatro ocasiones muy claras y no las aprovechamos roberto soldado es una apuesta personal y del club tiene mucha calidad y juventud vamos a ver lo que pasa estos cuatro partidos en holanda y alemania
374172 el entrenador pidi una plantilla de 22 y al final nos vamos a tener que quedar con una plantilla de 24 25 tengo que felicitar al director deportivo porque ha conseguido sacar a cinco futbolistas que no es f cil
374173 si hubiese otro fichaje tendr a que sacar a uno para meter a otro el director deportivo tiene rdenes de mantener la plantilla en 22 23 jugadores porque ya la cantera empieza a a producir chavales
374174 el a o pasado con laudrup ya debutaron con el primer equipo dos canteranos este a o juanfran y richi jugar n alg n partido con el primer equipo es la mejor forma de garantizar un futuro al getafe
374175 es un a o en el que menos hemos fichado recuperamos a gavil n y granero y respetamos el bloque de la campa a anterior es la mejor forma de ir introduciendo a la cantera
374176 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

374179 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
374180 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
374181 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
374182 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
374183 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

374186 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
374187 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
374188 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

374230 my first job at pratt was at the pennsylvania avenue branch in 1954 and later i worked with margaret edwards and bunny siebert in young adult services it was exciting going to city public schools and getting kids excited about reading
374231 as a result i played a major role with other ashburton homeowners when we established pool scapers that put ponds in peoples backyards
374232 were having a wonderful time were open from 10 a m to 9 p m and even have several book clubs that meet in the shop
374233 some people said it was unlikely that it wont happen
374234 the market is going to be soft for a couple of years
374235 while there is much uncertainty we expect weak economic growth and soft u s lodging demand to persist into 2009
374236 but the fact remains that the city and the state put money into the expanded convention center and you do not have enough rooms in town to fully utilize the center
374237 in order to book the convention center youve got to have the hotel rooms first in the long term it should increase lodging demand in the city because the city will be able to handle large groups
374238 we wanted a quiet presence of a building not flashy that would wear well over time
374239 the goal was to have this hotel feel uniquely baltimore

374262 we dont over think it we just have them play the song as they hear it or sing the tune with their own voice in terms of the arrangements we often make changes to the guitar and bass parts in order to make gameplay more interesting in
374263 theres at least a half dozen other bands waiting in the wings to see what happens with this case

374283 based upon information obtained as recently as today august 1 she accepts the fact that the testing was properly done and the results properly reported

374294 everybody can be pitched to but hes one person that can change a lineup and make hitters around him better
374295 if you make a bad pitch which i have against him at times hes going to do what he does best so to give him two singles today including an infield hit im pretty happy with that
374296 i havent had a good outing and ive put a lot of burden on the rest of the team
374297 decided since jake was coming off a physical performance he could use the day off

374323 son before we finish eating mom and dad need to talk to you about the rules regarding our bedroom door what is our rule
374324 yes you must knock before coming in now you have been having a big problem keeping that rule you almost never knock and its gotten to the point that we need to talk about it for example tonight when mom and dad were laying down and you kept coming in did you knock first even after we reminded you
374325 no but i am always just tempted to open the door and come in knocking takes a long time
374326 well here is the thing son i need to find a way to explain this so you will understand why its important to knock so ill be blunt a lot of the time that mom and dad are in their bedroom they are naked not only naked but mom and dad also like to kiss while naked we like to kiss naked a lot if you are going to keep barging into our room without knocking i need to let you know that there is a very good possibility that you are going to see a lot of naked kissing unless you knock then we have time to not be naked and stop kissing so what do you think
374327 i dont think that i will ever be tempted to come into your room ever again

374329 es w re bezaubernd sollte alonso zu uns kommen denn er ist der beste fahrer auf wie abseits der strecke und er ist ein mann der einen unterschied machen kann
374330 wir haben ein sehr fortgeschrittenes ker system wir haben vier windkan le einen davon in japan wir haben das notwendige personal f r das projekt und wir sind generell ziemlich fortschrittlich wenn alonso zu uns kommt dann werden wir mit ihm ein siegerteam aufbauen
374331 wenn jemand bei dir einzieht dann glaubst du immer dass es f r das ganze leben ist
374332 das vergangene rennen war f r uns sehr schwierig wenn es darum ging von den reifen eine gute haftung zu erhalten aber da waren wir nicht das einzige team die meisten fahrer hatten w hrend des rennens eine menge probleme haftung zu finden die reifen waren sehr sehr hart wom glich f r diese art von kurs zu hart besonders der harte reifen es gab berhaupt keine abnutzung der reifen arbeitete auf diesem kurs einfach nicht dies galt f r uns und es galt auch f r die meisten anderen teams
374333 silverstone war eine andere geschichte wir hatten feuchte bedingungen und erneut analysierten wir was schief lief sagen wir an einem der beiden autos und wir denken dass wir es verstanden haben parallel m ssen wir nat rlich die leistung unseres hauptgegners analysieren wir m ssen also am generellen aspekt der leistung des autos arbeiten und versuchen eine verbesserung zu finden versuchen aufzuholen wenn sie in den vergangenen paar rennen vielleicht im vergleich zu uns einen gr eren schritt nach vorn gemacht haben so einfach ist das es sind noch acht rennen zu fahren wir m ssen also arbeiten und mehr leistung finden
374334 in bezug auf die haftung des reifen den umgang mit den reifen ist es eine typische situation f r budapest am ersten tag die strecke ist zu beginn sehr gr n man hat probleme mit graining und dann kommt st ck f r st ck gummi auf die strecke und damit auch haftung diesbez glich gibt es also kein bestimmtes problem
374335 wir sind diesbez glich schon sehr sehr besch ftigt haben vor einer langen zeit damit begonnen es ist eine sehr schwierige situation aber nicht f r uns im besonderen sondern f r alle unsere hauptgegner es ist eine sehr sehr schwierige situation wir m ssen im hinblick auf die aktuelle meisterschaft druck machen wir m ssen aber auch im hinblick auf das n chstj hrige auto intensiv arbeiten
374336 wir haben nur ein team wir haben keine zwei teams wir ben tigen aus diesem grund ein sehr sehr sorgf ltiges ressourcen management wir m ssen die optimale balance zwischen diesen beiden aktivit ten finden denn wir wollen dieses jahr nicht alles investieren und dann kommendes jahr an fehlender leistung leiden wir wollen dieses jahr stark sein wir wollen kommendes jahr stark sein das ist also sehr schwierig
374337 ich denke dass dies eine ziemlich normale aerodynamik entwicklung ist die wir ein paar mal im windkanal getestet haben dann entschieden wir uns sie aus verschiedenen gr nden auf der strecke auszuprobieren f r uns gab es einen kleinen leistungsvorteil wir haben sie nun hier es ist also einfach eine normale entwicklung f r mehr leistung wie sie andere teams schon haben
374338 um ehrlich zu sein gibt es in bezug auf das setup keinen gro en unterschied zwischen den fahrern unsere beiden fahrer haben einen unterschiedlichen fahrstil in bezug auf die einstellung vom qualifying bis zum rennen manchmal sind sie diesbez glich auf ein paar spezifischen strecken im vergleich zu anderen ziemlich unterschiedlich aber in bezug auf das mechanische setup gibt es keine gr eren unterschiede wir k nnen also mit beiden in einer parallelen richtung arbeiten und dann nutzen was wir vom anderen fahrer am anderen auto gelernt haben und umgekehrt
374339 nascar hat vor einigen jahren drei gro e kriterien f r die aus ihrer sicht interessanten internationalen m rkte erstellt ein bedeutender weltmarkt eine etablierte motorsport tradition und eine affinit t in richtung der amerikaner in deutschland sind all diese dinge vorhanden wir haben mit dem lausitzring sogar ein funktionsf higes tri oval deutschland hat die nascar kriterien also sogar bererf llt wann sehen wir auf dem lausitzring wenigstes einmal die nationwide serie live wie es bereits in mexiko oder kanada gehandhabt wird
374340 was zu deutschland wahrscheinlich noch besser passen w rde w re eine deutsche stockcar serie warum soll man sich nur mit einem event zufrieden geben wenn man eine ganze meisterschaft haben k nnte der deutsche markt umfasst 90 millionen menschen man hat viele der gr ten hersteller und eine gro e motorsport tradition aber deutschland selbst hat nur eine echte meisterschaft und das ist die dtm
374341 wenn man sich aber den gesamten markt ansieht dann kratzt man sich schon am kopf und fragt sich ob es da m glichkeiten gibt entweder die dtm auszubauen oder eine neue kategorie speziell f r den deutschen markt aufzubauen
374342 eine antwort darauf habe ich nat rlich nicht da m sste man mit jemandem vor ort zusammenarbeiten um das herauszufinden die leute von der v8 star serie haben vor ein paar jahren den versuch unternommen vielleicht war es die richtige idee zur falschen zeit aber vielleicht ist es nur eine frage der zeit bis jemand anderes wieder so ein konzept einf hrt
374343 in bezug auf ein nationwide rennen sehen wir uns jedes jahr die m glichkeiten an ich w rde jetzt nicht hergehen und sagen dass dies f r immer und ewig unm glich w re aber wir glauben dass der beste erfolgsweg derjenige ist etwas vor ort aufzubauen doch alles ist zu jeder zeit eine m gliche option
374344 das gleiche gilt vermutlich f r den sprint cup unbestreitbar ist jedoch das erheblich gestiegene interesse an nascar umso wichtiger werden tv bertragungen wenn m glich live gibt es pl ne damit der sprint cup in deutschland wieder live bertragen wird
374345 nat rlich wollen wir unsere deutschen fans damit bedienen und wir haben in den vergangenen jahren zusammen mit unseren freunden von premiere die live action der nascar auch bringen k nnen das erste jahr lief auch sehr gut denn wir konnten die live action der nascar in deutschland einf hren und die leute haben auch wirklich gemocht was sie da zu sehen bekamen
374346 doch leider sind dann einige dinge im deutschen tv markt geschehen zum beispiel der preis f r die bundesliga rechte die nascar etwas zur ckgeworfen haben daher gibt es nun keine live bertragungen mehr aber wir hoffen sehr dass dies nur ein tempor rer zustand ist
374347 es ist ganz sicher nicht das was wir wollen und auch nicht das was die fans wollen und auch nicht das was premiere will wir waren das opfer von etwas mit dem wir nichts zu tun hatten von etwas was nicht innerhalb unserer kontrolle war
374348 gibt es aktuell konkrete verhandlungen mit premiere oder einem anderen tv sender auf dem deutschsprachigen markt in sachen live bertragungen
374349 wir haben nach wie vor eine ganz enge verbindung mit den leuten von premiere es ist ein offener dialog die aktuelle bertragungssituation hat nichts damit zu tun was nascar getan hat oder nicht tun wollte leider ist man zu 100 prozent in dinge verwickelt die sehr zeitintensiv sind und die wichtigere themen betreffen
374350 wie steht es um die internationalen bertragungsrechte die meines wissens nach derzeit bei espn liegen ist das richtig
374351 nein espn ist sozusagen unser handelsvertreter und wir verhandeln unsere rechte in zusammenarbeit mit ihnen wir sind also in jede diskussion in jede verhandlung und in jeden vertrag der abgeschlossen wird stark eingebunden
374352 was sie aber zum beispiel in europa f r uns machen k nnen ist dass sie ber eine gro e gruppe an menschen verf gen die in der gleichen zeitzone leben und die uns dabei helfen k nnen den markt besser zu bedienen als wir es von den usa aus tun k nnten
374353 ich frage deshalb weil espn mit ihrer marke nasn wenigstens einige nationwide rennen live bertr gt
374354 in sachen sprint cup rennen lizenzieren wir nicht auf einer gesamteurop ischen ebene das w rde unsere m glichkeiten begrenzen mit einem lokalen partner zu arbeiten f r die sprint cup serie empfinden wir es als wichtiger individuelle partner aus gr eren medienkonzernen zu haben die jeweils individuelle m rkte abdecken aber f r die nationwide serie ist ein berregionaler partner aus unserer sicht gut geeignet
374355 das bedeutet also dass es 2009 in deutschland nur dann eine live bertragung von sprint cup rennen geben wird wenn eine tv gesellschaft einen exklusiven vertrag mit nascar eingehen will
374356 das ist gar nicht unbedingt notwendig denn wir wollen einen deutschen tv partner wir haben eine wunderbare beziehung zu premiere was uns aber nicht davon abhalten w rde auch mit jemand anderem zusammenzuarbeiten wir unterhalten uns regelm ig auch mit anderen entscheidenden figuren und wir hoffen stark dass es f r 2009 irgendein positives resultat geben wird
374357 der sprint cup ist unser top produkt der nutzen den wir mit einem lokalen partner haben ist ganz einfach die qualit t in sachen produktion und promotion was uns dabei hilft dieses produkt f r die fans zu inszenieren ard zdf rtl sat1 und so weiter sind daf r eher unwahrscheinlichere kandidaten
374358 das bedeutet also dass nascar auf einen exklusiven partner wartet und den sprint cup nicht auf einem gesamteurop ischen kanal wie eurosport oder nasn senden wird
374359 gibt es dann anlass zum optimismus dass es den sprint cup saison 2009 wieder live auf deutschen bildschirmen zu sehen gibt
374360 warum nicht das einzige was fehlt ist ein interessierter partner dabei geht es weniger um finanzielle themen oder verhandlungstaktiken aber die leute auf dem deutschen markt die an nascar interessiert w ren besch ftigen sich momentan mit anderen themen
374361 once you make it to the top level youve definitely got to be dedicated to run with these guys
374362 basically if youre not racing the series youre racing at your home track or practicing
374363 doing it online will allow me to go to races and still get my homework done
374364 im getting used to these larger tracks it seems like the last 10 or so races have been run on bigger tracks for the bigger twin bikes
374365 next year ill work on my degree and be able to continue racing too
374366 i absolutely love this sport i think its the best one out there and i want to stay in it as long as i can
374367 we come in day in and day out and try to put on a good show for the fans
374368 we just try to come and play hard every day and get the job done
374369 i thought the ball hit off the backstop and i turned around and i saw him on the ground and he didnt look too good
374370 i dont know what happened to him i heard a concussion or something like that
374371 i just hope hes ok our prayers are with him just like everybody else on the team and the fans and everybody
374372 ive seen umpires get hit and then be able to get back up and finish the game but that was strange
374373 that must have really had some impact maybe it was just the way it hit him but thats the first time ive seen that one
374374 the coaching staff plays a big part in that with keeping everybody focused and not letting people slack off
374375 we play to win we show up every day and we expect to win so that takes care of itself
374376 if there was a pipeline from the gulf to billings montana our prices would probably be less than today because of the competitive pressures
374377 freight cost back into this market would exceed any savings
374378 the gasoline just like crude oil is a commodity and its priced on the local market
374379 we export 60 percent of the fuel from billings so billings doesnt set the price there are a lot of times when billings is the lowest price in the market
374380 i never get called to answer the question why are we cheapest in the region
374381 there are times that we are gas is a commodity and we sell on a regional market
374382 the refineries in billings dont refine crude from the williston basin
374383 public pressure is a very effective tool and if people keep pounding on the issue they may actually get someplace
374384 so far what i see is everyone had a hamburger
374385 these guys got sick after these guys so they passed it on
374386 theyre basically using the epidemiological model to teach kids about life
374387 were really promoting public health because thats what we do but they can get more out of it
374388 people are really starting to realize how important public health is
374389 people think its weird but youre shy around people with a different culture
374390 you get to be creative and you get to be with native americans like you
374391 i think its one of the more competitive tournaments since ive been here
374392 in the east weve got the scarlets royals and us helena has proven it can beat anybody the stallions are swinging the bats real well and missoula can beat anybody its a good field
374393 you cant overlook anybody everybodys got the talent to win i think you always look at the teams that have put together great seasons but you can be a no 1 seed and be the best team and play a bad game
374394 i feel real good because were playing good team baseball we dont rely on one guy ill be disappointed if we arent playing on wednesday
374395 our pitching rotation is set thomas ackerman and matt eames in the first two games and well see what happens were looking forward to playing i expect the boys to be up to play youve got to play good to win one you cant play bad
374396 i think everyone swings it pretty well i think its going to be old fashioned baseball with who can get the best pitching and defense that can win it
374397 they are hungry they really want to defend the title but its going to be tough
374398 when we talked to the architect at the outset we told him we wanted to use the arts we want to use drama video the techie things that are available now
374399 some people learn better by listening to a sermon some people learn better by video some by seeing a drama or through music
374400 so we want to use all those things to communicate the message clearly
374401 we need to stop and catch our breath and make sure everything is financially prudent
374402 well probably know by the first of the year when were going to proceed with that
374403 because the primary focus of our church is to reach people for christ this church is like a big net
374404 if we build a bigger church then we can help more people over the long haul
374405 and if we do things well some of them will stay
374406 were not trying to pull people out of good bible based churches
374407 we dont want to trade christians were here because we want to reach new people
374408 were grayer than we used to be and were now reaching out to more and more young people all the time
374409 we decided we were going to create a space where people can sit and relax have coffee with friends and meet new people
374410 we said we feel its important to communicate to our community and to the lord that we know its more than about a building
374411 and so were giving 10 percent of all the money we raised to compassion kinds of things in our community as well as in other places in the world
374412 weve kind of upped the ante just because of our awareness
374413 when we do help people in need we want to make sure we do it in jesus name
374414 its not to manipulate them but so they know that god loves them and our primary concern is where people spend eternity
374415 when youre talking to livestock producers specifically sheep producers losses are significantly lower which is going to be tremendously beneficial to us this year
374416 generally a predators natural population control if they dont have a natural enemy is eating themselves out of a food source
374417 if were going to keep a diverse population out there were going to have to help manage that and at some point you have to destroy animal life the object of this is to control the coyote populations both for livestock and wildlife populations
374418 these animals are so prolific theyre going to reoccupy habitat its going to be a constant bloodletting a tremendous waste of money and youre not going to change your overall losses very much
374419 thats kind of hard to accept if you consider how all these species have evolved together we have national parks where there is no predator control and the wildlife including prey is thriving
374420 the governor believes its important to tout montana and one way he does that is by communicating
374421 the law was not designed to stop the governor from asking the people of montana to thank farmers and ranchers
374422 this case is a pretty black and white case about the rule of law
374423 the rule of law applies to everyone including the chief executive of the state no one is above the law
374424 buy local products and say thank you to a farmer during this the national ag month
374425 these are the types of things that would essentially be stopped if you construe the law the way the republicans want you to
374426 seemed to delight in inflicting punishment the basement was a chamber of horrors to the youngsters who were regaled by the older children with tales of terrible whippings which the yells and entreaties which sometimes floated up from the lower regions clinched in their minds
374427 the principal is recovering from a sprained ankle which is said to be the sequel of an earlier incident when an older girl whom he attempted to punish pushed him down a flight of stairs
374428 should a teacher have occasion to administer corporal punishment she is hereby directed to do it in the presence of her principal and with the rubber tube provided for the purpose should a principal have occasion to administer corporal punishment she is hereby directed to do it in the presence of another teacher of her building and with the rubber tube provided for the purpose
374429 in the future no corporal punishment shall be inflicted on any pupil attending the schools of this district unless the approval of the superintendent of schools and the district is first obtained and the superintendent is present when the punishment is administered
374430 people should not be doing public service announcements on public time if theyve filed for public office
374431 wanted to prevent politicians from using public money to promote themselves
374432 it was to keep public officials from doing psas on government money and government time that was the premise of the bill
374433 it could have been much much worse this is rugged terrain
374434 in three days maximum were going to have a line on this and can put it to bed
374435 ive never had that many hot shot crews in my career
374436 i couldnt have imagined at the beginning of this week that id get here at the end of this week and it would be in such good shape
374437 its 180 degrees from where we were at the beginning of the week
374438 our house is just on the other side of that hill
374439 we have a vested interest but my house is probably not defensible i live on sheep mountain one way out one way in
374440 removing the fuel lets us fight the fire on our terms
374441 they were very strong when that cold front hit and it really sent that fire off to the races
374442 in this country theres a lot more wind than we find anywhere else
374443 once it got established and moving we had almost a 10 mile fire front
374444 both of them have people that care for the land
374445 theyre also areas where the locals know fire and might understand it better
374446 im from montana but im not from here so i dont know where silver run is or aspen subdivision
374447 the ifl and uif are two of the sports most stable business organizations
374448 combining strengths and resources will create a partnership that will insure the long term growth of indoor football

374453 the other tidbit dealt with the question will there be a b5 computer gt game soon jms said he could not talk about it now but that in two gt weeks expect something big to be announced he hinted that if you ever gt wanted to live in the b5 universe you might get your chance now gt either thats a super holobrothel or a mmorpg im hoping for the gt former
374454 hall or building so vast that you cant see its walls or roof just the obsidian floor and the shelves around examine the shelves more closely notice the books are made of page like sheets of glass that light in the building gives them eerie bluish glow take one of them out of the shelf examine what it says its just a date and rest is scrambled doesnt say anything just random letters and numbers void of meaning you hear steps behind you turn around and see a woman in a black cloak and the shadow of the hood hides her face you can see only her face from below the nose which is covered in white make up except for her upper lip and small striped middle of her lower lip which are completely black everything freezes to that moment and slowly fades to darkness

374463 oh another student that devoted their whole summer to sat prep to raise their scores
374464 if i ever feel better remind me to spend some good time with you
374465 just because chorus girls have to shave their legs and underarms is no reason why women in general should turn up their nose at the practice shave your legs for here the razor gives the best results soaking the legs in warm water and then rubbing them with pumice stone is a long process it may discourage the hair but then the hair may take years before it becomes properly discouraged
374466 leg make up when you use leg make up apply a thin coat of mineral oil first and let it dry then spread papers on the floor so you wont splatter make up allow yourself at least ten minutes to do the job right 1 start makeup at the instep and smooth upward to a point above the knee be sure to end it in an even line tie a ribbon around your thigh where the stocking ends and remove it when make up dries 2 pat make up with the palm of your hands then buff with cotton inspect the backs of legs too to be sure theyre even 3 never try to patch up yesterdays make up job besides leg make up is drying to the skin and should be thoroughly washed off every night 4 be careful if you cross your legs on hot summer days not to smudge your make up
374467 if we are to get food prices down we must also do more to deal with unnecessary demand
374468 but the sales department is confident that based on what theyve done historically well do some decent sales in the next week or so
374469 they will make money but they havent reached targets yet
374470 my hope is the opening ceremonies are spectacular enough that it gets people all that much more interested
374471 were just not sure what but my friend whos the head of australian television swears he heard an explosion around 2 in the morning on tuesday hes convinced they were seeding the clouds somehow so it would rain and then clear up
374472 i said i think youre being a bit of a conspiracy theorist but who knows it totally cleared the next day and coincidentally they were recording aerials
374473 i picked up the phone and leif said you dont know me but ive retired from football and id like to join the boulevard club a tennis centre in toronto
374474 then he said i understand youre quite a tennis player
374475 a year and half later he was playing with all the top guys at the club
374476 leif said i think id like to be a tv commentator so wed play tennis and then wed talk about television one day he asked can you give me a reference i said how can i do that youve never been on tv the next thing i know hes working for tsn
374477 everything in excess is masama dapat hindi talaga 100 percent na kinakain everything in excess is bad it should not be taken 100
374478 no i am way under budget and well ahead of schedule the project report is right here where did you get absurd that idea
374479 you come in and make outrageous charges you know are not true what motivates these absurd allegations
374480 what you do speaks so loudly that i cannot hear what you say
374481 why is this line so long and slow why dont you get more cashiers
374482 oh i wish the line was much shorter and faster too thank you so much for your patience we really value your business
374483 ill call her next week to see if we can reopen the discussions
374484 the page needs to be titled leadership how do we get this fixed quickly
374485 im not going to argue with you the board and the membership know the package as leadership the current title is deceptive and misleading
374486 can you get it fixed fast or do i have to speak to someone above you
374487 why do you continue to defend a name that is clearly wrong inaccurate and deceptive leaders wouldnt look for their materials in that category
374488 i need to know you are going to change it right now can i count on you to do it
374489 the leadership materials need to be described as leadership because thats what they are and thats how people know them the current title is deceptive and misleading this is a silly thing to argue about lets get it fixed
374490 the hard part of getting water to split is not the hydrogen platinum as a catalyst works fine for the hydrogen but platinum works very poorly for oxygen making you use much more energy
374491 what we have done is made a catalyst work for the oxygen part without any extra energy in fact with our catalyst almost 100 percent of the current used for electrolysis goes into making oxygen and hydrogen
374492 nickel oxide cant be used around anything else in the environment because of corrosion even the carbon dioxide in the air will react with it to make carbonates
374493 but our catalyst uses abundant materials that dont react with environment
374494 they are covered in candlewax from the candles the miner was using to light the tunnel he was working in
374495 dr mitchell declines to name the sources he is getting this information from
374496 its always an unnamed source or a source close to the minister of defence you cannot take that as evidence of fact
374497 hes making those statements obviously hes gone public with them but there is always doubt that the sources he is talking to arent playing the disinformation game with him
374498 so bene che valentino rossi sempre stato un pilota esemplare e ha fatto una carriera incredibile ma sono deluso per come si comportato a laguna seca
374499 dopo laguna seca posso dire di aver perso il rispetto per uno dei pi grandi campioni della storia di questo sport io ho sempre cercato di superare i miei avversari in modo corretto
374500 sul podio a valentino gli ho detto che ha esagerato ed ero deluso dal suo comportamento sono sempre chiaro e non mi nascondo mai se ho qualcosa da dire vedremo nelle prossime gare se sar aggressivo alla stessa maniera

374513 a backlash among mainstream labour mps against david milibands decision to stake his claim to become leader amid fears that his move could hasten a general election before the first signs of an economic recovery
374514 have they not done their sums if brown is ousted in the autumn and we have a new leader next year there will have to be an election almost immediately even though the economy will not have had a chance to recover this is a kamikaze move
374515 ive already told you three times if i come back you are all coming out to the green to sleep separately now whisper you know how to whisper whisper i mean it or else

374519 paradise promoted the booster campaign that created los angeles 1870 1930
374520 we decided on a smooth seamless cap of poured concrete to edge the pool but when we started looking for the tile to go beneath it we werent able to find anything that worked
374521 covered in thin reflective slivers of tile that looked almost like piano keys
374522 its not going to save all the houses out there in fact it will be a small amount
374523 but i think its time we take this kind of dramatic action to address the problems of foreclosure
374524 we leased 12 jags last night when normally we only do two per day
374525 we remain committed to leasing as a valuable part of our business
374526 but theyve had them in the past and the kitchen sink keeps coming back
374527 we came here and just fell in love with the house
374528 theres not a lot you need to or can do to it
374529 its rough cut red cedar and we find it beautiful
374530 we wanted to play off the wood walls and soften the feel
374531 i love the exaggerated chesterfield tufting and the fastening bolts and carabiners so you can reconfigure it into a pit or anything else we collected these pieces from around the world i love how the softness of them plays off the clean lines of the room
374532 it was a great old kitchen but it had some things that were hard for us
374533 we were torn the original heath tile was beautiful but we needed to increase our counter space storage space and make room for modern appliances
374534 we wanted to try to use the products fickett would have used
374535 the only place we varied that was for the countertops
374536 we never seriously considered doing anything except selling until a broker suggested we take the equity out of our existing home buy another house and rent out the old house until the market turns around
374537 when the market really fell out last year we decided to take his advice
374538 about 15 of the national landlord market is new to landlording in the past two years
374539 the value of my home has dropped to 450 000
374540 so ive decided to hang on and lease it out but im having a hard time finding a renter
374541 so it might cost us to rent them now but its worth it to take that loss and make money later down the road
374542 there are tenants out there looking for naive landlords who will rent to them but have no intention of paying the rent
374543 so its incredibly important for landlords to go through the initial procedures of having the tenant fill out an application and go over it with a fine tooth comb
374544 the governor promised california when he was running for this job that he was the leader that could work with the legislature to get responsible budgets for california
374545 i needed this job to continue to do my part in being their mother to provide them with the security that they need
374546 it hurts me to my heart to have to tell my sons this
374547 understands how difficult this is going to be for state workers
374548 its a day by day situation so well try to manage
374549 i knew when they start cutting jobs youre going to get poor service
374550 we dont believe the governor has the authority to lay off state workers by executive fiat and thats what that executive order does
374551 we will defend ourselves in court if necessary to make sure the state can meet its obligations
374552 imagine going in to talk to your boss and saying lets talk about wages and he says well im cutting you to minimum wage now what do you want to talk about
374553 saddam has been hanged karadzic was recently arrested but this man goes around the world lecturing on the rule of law
374554 i am disgusted that tony blair has been invited to malaysia this man to me is a war criminal through instigating the war in iraq he has killed more than former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic and former iraqi president saddam hussein
374555 it is disgusting to see this criminal of the highest order being welcomed in malaysia and worse still to talk on the rule of law when he broke all international laws and the laws of his own country by deliberately lying and sending young british soldiers to die in a war of aggression
374556 yet you have seen how readily the united states and its cohorts condemn the president of sudan omar bashir for alleged war crimes in darfur when there is no evidence that he deliberately issued orders to war against anyone
374557 the conspiracy of silence by malaysias media is to be condemned for you are lending support to a war criminal whose criminal acts must not go unpunished
374558 you thought should i try to break the pass up ive got to make sure im not forcing him out there was too much gray area this clears everything up and makes the game a lot simpler i welcome it
374559 its not so much that it favors the defense as much as it takes a lot of the guesswork out of the game
374560 i guess it is kind of helping the defense but its also making it easy on the referees too
374561 because a lot of big plays were made in the last year where it came down to was a guys foot inbound
374562 if hes in the air push him out of bounds as long as you dont carry him out of bounds its out of bounds
374563 were in the air trying to make a catch trying to get two feet in but the momentum of the defensive player is forcing us out of bounds theyre taking some of the guesswork out of it but theyre also taking away part of the offensive players game
374564 happens a lot because the best way to beat the cover two defense is the corner route
374565 when we play a cover two team thats what we do its a timing route
374566 i guess you just have to work more on getting your feet in bounds without getting forced out
374567 run patterns a little better and get separation so you wont have to worry about that
374568 as an offensive player its not my favorite rule change
374569 youre going to see some hits on the sideline defensive guys trying to blast an offensive guy if i was a defensive player id try to hit somebody and make sure they didnt land in bounds
374570 i saw different aspects of the game at corner as far as knowing where the help from a safety is
374571 a lot of offensive guys would grab that facemask and push
374572 now if the db turns his head or jerks in any way and we have hold of his facemask thats a penalty i havent done it a lot but it happens
374573 government ownership of media outlets is superior to corporate ownership of media outlets

374581 over a year ago mexico took the positive step of passing a new law to protect women from violence but a law will not prevent women from being beaten raped and abused unless its implemented rigorously at the federal and state level
374582 womens struggle for safety and justice violence in the family in mexico
374583 women in mexico need to have their complaints of abuse taken seriously and they need access to justice and effective protection mechanisms

374585 the nds has no right to interfere in this case and its involvement signifies an unwarranted government intrusion on afghanistans media
374586 the nds should not become a tool for the government to intimidate its critics
374587 a restriction sought to be justified on the ground of national security is not legitimate if its genuine purpose or demonstrable effect is to protect interests unrelated to national security including for example to protect a government from embarrassment or exposure of wrongdoing or to conceal information about the functioning of its public institutions
374588 it seems that fayyaz arrest had nothing to do with national security and everything to do with officials violating human rights in promotion of their own personal and possibly illegal interests every incident like this sends a chill through the spines of afghan journalists who are already very vulnerable to violence and intimidation
374589 the ioc put in place a working group with bocog to start examining one by one those sites on the internet that the international media thought should be unblocked
374590 and they included unusually sites like bbc china for goodness sake deutsche welle amnesty international
374591 some of you will notice already that we started to get agreement to open sites which were previously closed yesterday and thats still occurring
374592 i guess there will be some debate as we move towards the games theres still sites that may or may not be open and the line between what could be considered as a national interest issue might be a bit blurred but we will work on it
374593 and we will deal with any particular grievance reasonable grievance that a journalist or representative of the media may have if they feel they havent got access to a particular site
374594 i think there might have been a case for us to articulate or clear the sorts of sites which might have remained censored
374595 but thats a bit hard if you like to articulate because it changes from time to time
374596 in every country in the world theres sites that are subject to censorship by the government in respect of what they would regard as subversive sites or sites that might endanger or jeopardise national interests
374597 what we were concerned with was that no sites outside of that would be off limits to you to the international media to report on the games here in china
374598 i have dealt my whole life with fires but i have never seen a sight like this i can safely say that we are experiencing a catastrophe
374599 our only consolation is that there has been no loss of life the weather conditions are very poor
374600 my house was burned down but i saved my children and my husband who is sick with parkinsons disease
374601 where have you been in the cellar with your friend
374602 ill keep the dishes clean even the sticky maple syrupy ones
374603 theres no place like home theres no place like home
374604 we hope to see you online as biscuit again very soon
374605 it was getting pretty crowded in our ellicott city house
374606 here we have six acres for our soccer field and basketball court
374607 you enter by the back sliding door at the swimming pool who puts a swimming pool by the front door
374608 there will be a front porch and the view will be incredible
374609 i have a feeling that one of our children will get married here
374610 i saw a clip of the show and i went oh my god i want to do that and ive been working really hard ever since
374611 usually its the wives or the girlfriends that call about classes and now its the husbands and boyfriends
374612 gentlemen see its ok to dance they see the sports figures dancing so they see its ok
374613 whatever is mainstream is always going to be whatever people are watching and paying attention to and as a business owner were just trying to capitalize on that in the industry
374614 i look at their tango and sometimes its fun to say ooh thats what they were doing
374615 i think that people you know you get the impression from the little story of how the amateurs learned to dance in a week that you can learn to do it
374616 i think there are a lot of people who dont really realize exactly how much work it is to learn to do it because tv performers are doing it six or seven hours a day for the show and we all have jobs
374617 it was a small and very low intensity explosive one without any timer the material was found late last night from channapatna 70 kms from here
374618 we cannot afford to lose the battle against ideologies of hatred
374619 a selfish act aimed at ensuring release of rajnikants latest movie kusulan in karnataka
374620 for what has rajnikant expressed regret his speech or the fast organised in support of tamil nadus stand on the hogenakkal project was he saying that he should not have participated in the protest at all he owes an explanation to the people of tamil nadu who have made him the superstar he is today
374621 it is not only a disgrace to him but also to his fans in tamil nadu if kannada organisations threatened to stall the release of my movie i would have happily compensated my producers from my pocket than apologise
374622 his statement only reveals his humane nature and his wish to ensure his fans in karnataka watch the movie

374638 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
374639 well im old enough to remember my grandparents talking about the fall and the great depression of 1929 so i was concerned about the bank totally closing not being able to get the money that was the main concern because my wife and i are both retirees and this is you know savings that we depend on monthly
374640 i cant move my arms i requested medical care a long time ago you havent done anything about it

374642 no im not youre not here i lost my eyes i lost my feet everything
374643 no you still have your eyes and your feet are still at the end of your legs you know
374644 now we know who martyred our two sisters we know who martyred the people of deh rawod and we know who martyred the people in kabul now this has become clear and we have told the government of pakistan that the killings of people in afghanistan the destruction of bridges in afghanistan are carried out by pakistans intelligence and pakistans military departments
374645 the bush oil policy is an attempt at mass deception by a white house that has for the last seven and a half years pursued big oils agenda of drill drill drill
374646 i just submitted an application requesting to the pre trial chamber number three to issue an arrest warrant against omar hassan ahmad al bashir for genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes
374647 lets not be naive its not going to happen in the next couple of days thats clear to us but its not the first time that a head of state sitting head of state has been indicted you will remember the examples of slobodan milosevic in 99 or taylor in 2001 who was also the sitting president of liberia at the time they were not arrested immediately but eventually when the international community threw its weight behind these arrest warrants
374648 to have the federal government disappear your marriage im sure will be painful and upsetting it really is something out of orwell its shameful
374649 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
374650 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
374651 wait a minute we cant have acquittals weve been holding these guys for years how are we going to explain that we cant have acquittals weve got to have convictions

374659 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
374660 this decision means the president can pick up any person in the country citizen or legal resident and lock them up for years without the most basic safeguard in the constitution the right to a criminal trial
374661 contrary to everything the canadian public has been told about omar khadr the tapes do not show a dangerous terrorist but instead a frightened wounded canadian boy pleading for help from canadian officials instead of helping they casually dismiss his claims of abuse and mistreatment and tell him that they will do nothing for him
374662 we are hoping that the canadian public will recognize that you put aside any concerns of guilt or innocence that has to be determined in a properly constituted court which of course is not guantanamo bay and look at compassion as we feel the children have a special significance in society this kid has suffered enough this kid needs to come home this kid is not a terrorist
374663 i heard somebody say well its going to take seven years well if wed have done it seven years ago wed be having a different conversation today im not suggesting wed have completely created a you know changed the dynamics in the world but it certainly would have been wed have been using more of our own oil and sending less money overseas
374664 this war diminishes our security our standing in the world our military our economy and the resources that we need to confront the challenges of the twenty first century by any measure our single minded and open ended focus on iraq is not a sound strategy for keeping america safe i am running for president of the united states to lead this country in a new direction and to seize this moments promise

374669 as we said in 2000 the age of defeat has passed and the age of victory is upon us this people this nation this country has today given a clear message to the world to both friend and foe that it cannot be defeated
374670 the israelis certainly lost that war they did not get their prisoners back not until now and theyre getting them back dead more than 1 000 lebanese civilians and more than 160 israelis most of them soldiers all died for absolutely nothing and thats what todays prisoner exchanges prove
374671 the united states of america shall take all measures necessary to ensure that messrs jose ernesto medellin rojas cesar roberto fierro reyna ruben ramirez cardenas humberto leal garcia and roberto moreno ramos are not executed pending judgment on the request for interpretation submitted by the united mexican states unless and until these five mexican nationals receive review and reconsideration
374672 it is a palpable demonstration that we can negotiate like brothers that we can trust that we can advance together that we can overcome this silliness of competition between nations so we can advance together the cooperation between nations
374673 when the officer confessed his mistake to his superiors he said that as the helicopter was landing he saw such a quantity of guerrillas that he became very nervous and that he was afraid for his life and that he took out of his pocket the piece of cloth with the symbol of the international red cross committee logo that he carried in his pocket and put it on his bulletproof vest we regret that this has occurred
374674 when a public system fails repeatedly to meet these minimal objectives parents ask only for a choice in their education of their children some parents some parents may choose a better public school some may choose a private school many will choose a charter school no entrenched bureaucracy or union should deny parents that choice and children that opportunity
374675 i dont know and i dont know if the in fact im quite confident that the people who officially will determine that dont know either
374676 but do you feel that the people that are impacting it feel that were in a recession

374680 what is your position on senator dodds pledge to filibuster a bill that contains retroactive immunity
374681 oh theres good faith reasons not to impeach or to criminally prosecute
374682 well there may be legal excuses as to why he did that
374683 well these are important intellectual issues that we need to grapple with and its really not fair to put them inside of a courtroom or talk about prison
374684 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story

374686 as part of the war on terror for the first time in its history the united states has sanctioned government officials to physically and psychologically torment american held captives making torture the official law of the land in all but name
374687 bad news the reason were not getting better intelligence part of the reasoning anyway is that about a third of the people are innocent
374688 do you know anything about islamic radicals do you speak arabic have you got any background in this area
374689 the allegation that i provided assistance in the process of torture is completely false
374690 i gave a three hour lecture sponsored by sere the survival evasion resistance escape branch of the american armed forces at the san diego naval base in may 2002
374691 i have not worked under government contract or any other contract on any aspect of interrogation or any aspect of torture
374692 i have had no contact at all with the american psychological association about their relevant policies most importantly i strongly disapprove of torture and have never and would never provide assistance in its process
374693 if psychologists have to be there in order to keep detainees from being killed then those conditions are so horrendous that the only moral and ethical thing to do is to protest by leaving
374694 i am ashamed we are even having this conversation of course waterboarding is torture
374695 if it was done to me i would think it was torture
374696 you know you may acknowledge these laws or not but these laws exist
374697 are there weapons of mass destruction in iraq and are there connections between al qaeda and saddam hussein

374718 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
374719 we dont need these foreign multinationals to get the oil out of the ground we can do it ourselves we can bring in technical support without giving away management control without giving away ownership control
374720 sometimes during campaigns rhetoric gets overheated and amplified my core position has never changed ive always been a proponent of free trade
374721 senator obama unequivocally opposes giving retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies and has cosponsored senator dodds efforts to remove that provision from the fisa bill granting such immunity undermines the constitutional protections americans trust the congress to protect senator obama supports a filibuster of this bill and strongly urges others to do the same
374722 you know progressives and liberals dont know how to play poker there has to be somewhere to go
374723 oh well well give you aid but we want you to privatize your water your electricity system hand the coastline over to resorts

374725 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
374726 we face with the iranians and so do our allies and friends a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper and where the iranian appetite for nuclear technology as to this point is still unchecked and its hard for me to believe that an american president is not going to want to have the capability to defend our territory the territory of our allies whether they are in europe or whether they are in the middle east
374727 this is not good for our republic nor for europe nor for peace and security all around the world people are against the radar for different reasons radar and missiles have no security nor defensive reasoning
374728 every military action causes a military response this is the fundamental rule this is what military people are about if there is a military action if there is a change in strategic posture there is a counter change of strategic posture you can read it in every military textbook so there is nothing surprising there are not even questions to be asked about
374729 we cant have a memorandum of understanding with foreign forces unless it has dates and clear horizons determining the departure of foreign forces were unambiguously talking about their departure we are waiting impatiently for the day when the last foreign soldier leaves iraq
374730 let me first of all talk about the broader issue this whole notion that i am shifting to the center or that i m flip flopping or this or that or the other you know the people who say this apparently haven t been listening to me i ve been organizing with churches for years in the community and so the notion that somehow that s me trying to look like i m you know more centered more centrist is just not true don t assume that if i don t agree with you on something that it must be because i m doing that politically i may just disagree with you
374731 the chinese government is using the opportunity of hosting olympics to showcase the china that the chinese government wants the world to see and cover up the china that the chinese government does not want the outside to see so we came here to reveal this china to the other side of the world and more than that we have to send a message to the international community
374732 after fourteen months of study including seven meetings around the country and interviews with more than forty experts on this matter our commission has unanimously concluded that the central law governing this critical decision that is the war powers resolution of 1973 is ineffective and it should be repealed and it should be replaced however with a better law

374743 us presidential candidate barack obama talks about sixteen months that we think would be the right time frame for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes
374744 artificially prolonging the tenure of us troops in iraq would cause problems
374745 sen obama conveyed that he is committed to supporting afghanistan and to continue the war against terrorism with vigor
374746 to see young people like this who are doing such excellent work with so much dedication and pride just makes me feel good about the country and i want to make sure that everybody back home understands how much pride people take in their work here and how much sacrifice people are making its outstanding
374747 the situation is getting worse here even worse than iraq if the us government sends more troops here the violence will increase for example when we see a group of us soldiers walking here it doesnt make us feel safe our afghan forces are capable enough to ensure the security of afghanistan the us government should focus on other needs of afghans not the military
374748 there have not been any changes to the lives of ordinary afghans the visits and presence of foreigners has not changed the lives of poor afghans i returned from iran after twenty years there i had the best life when i was in iran now i have work like an animal in my country in order to feed my family my life is worse now what is the benefit of these western officials coming and going
374749 you said he was the most extreme member of the senate i think is the quote

374751 oh i dont know all i know is his voting record and thats what people usually judge their elected representatives by
374752 btselem received this morning footage filmed in the village of nilin approximately two weeks ago showing an israeli soldier firing a rubber coated steal bullet at a palestinian the palestinian has his hands tied behind his back and his eyes covered and the soldier is firing at him from very close range from approximately a meter and a half away this whole event happens in the presence of a high ranking officer a lieutenant colonel
374753 i know going awol was wrong but i thought it was the best way to stop the small kill teams

374757 this is a guarantee to keep any more worker safety regulation from ever coming out this is being done in secrecy to be sprung before president bush leaves office to cripple the next administration
374758 what i think can change is the ability of the united states government and a united states president to be actively engaged with the peace process and to be concerned and recognize the legitimate difficulties that the palestinian people are experiencing right now and recognize that it is not only in the interest of the palestinian people that their situation improves i believe its also in the interest of the israeli people because it is going to be very difficult for israel ever to feel secure if you dont have some sense of opportunity and prosperity and stability with its its neighbors
374759 its the credibility of the us the interest of the us has been adversely all affected by the last three years of american policy that has wreaked havoc in the region we need re engagement but we need positive re engagement in ways that would curb israeli violations and would help produce a just and genuine peace
374760 why have we come to rely on private contractors to provide combat or combat related security training for our forces
374761 mr hamdan or any accused at guantanamo but for right now mr hamdan if he is convicted he will stay at guantanamo bay if he is acquitted completely hell stay at guantanamo bay and if hes convicted and he gets lets say time served hes going to stay at guantanamo bay because the government has stated through their prosecutor mr murphy that regardless of what outcome in this case theyre allowed to detain mr hamdan for the duration of the global war on terrorism
374762 were in danger of losing our country to a war based on lies to destruction of our civil liberties but its your commitment and your willingness to stand up and speak out that has enabled me to take a stand and to say not only are we going to save whats right and save whats dear to us but were going to hold this administration accountable so that it never happens again
374763 theres no question about it wall street got one of the reasons i asked you to turn off the tv cameras it got drunk and now its got a hangover the question is how long will it sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments and then we got a housing issue not in houston and evidently not in dallas because lauras over there trying to buy a house i like crawford but unfortunately after eight years of asking her to sacrifice im now no longer the decision maker

374785 so today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within ten years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
374786 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

374795 the new president who will replace president bush is not going to change his policy in iraq his policy will remain the same regarding the occupation and iraq will see no change i do not think that he is going to change anything because the us policy is clear to everyone
374796 if the iraqi government were to say if you were president we want a timetable for troops being removed would you agree to that
374797 ive been there too many times ive met too many times with him and i know what they want they want it based on conditions and of course theyd like to have us out thats what happens when you win wars
374798 mukasey is asking congress to expand and extend the war on terror forever anyone that this president or the next one declares to be a terrorist could then be held indefinitely without a trial
374799 he is charged with genocide complicity to commit genocide murder extermination cruel treatment torture etc its a huge array of crimes committed in bosnia and herzegovina solely between march and december 1992 when bosnians serb republic was declared and radovan karadzic was its president but also for the crimes that were committed in the country from 92 until november 1995 including the genocide in srebrenica
374800 if he is guilty he has to be arrested but he is less guilty than others but they are not arrested only serbs are being arrested
374801 as we sign this memorandum of understanding we all commit ourselves to the first tentative step towards searching for a solution to the country that is in a crisis
374802 highly coercive environments and conditions under which they were made
374803 i crossed an artificial line today because appalachia is my homeland and its life is being destroyed far faster than it can regenerate
374804 they handcuffed me and placed me under the sun for about three hours then they picked me up walked me for a little bit and shot at me i found myself on the ground they told me we are going to fire a rubber bullet at you and i did not imagine that this is how they were going to act to open fire at me while i am handcuffed
374805 this policy should be condemned internationally through human rights organizations and they should be punished via an international court and not an israeli court at the end of the day they will be released the officer after a month or two or a short period he is in prison in front of the media but not in reality

374813 im here on this trip to reaffirm the special relationship between israel and the united states my abiding commitment to israels security and my hope that i can serve as an effective partner whether as a united states senator or as a president in bringing about a more lasting peace in the region
374814 these positions mean that there is no minimal hope to any change in the us foreign policy towards the arab israeli conflict and this means that we are in front of one american policy and the palestinian people should depend on their own and on the arab and muslim world in facing this opposing american policy which both the democratic and republican parties are adopting
374815 unless chevron is out of there the united states doesnt have the moral authority to tell other countries to get out
374816 regarding the conspiracy issue president morales addressed over the course of twenty minutes and with the aid of documents the political operation carried out and being carried out by the us embassy in bolivia the bolivian government president morales himself has requested the united states halt with its political conspiring in bolivia and instead has posed working together to conspire against poverty
374817 the question is do you want to play russian roulette with your brain i dont know that cell phones are dangerous but i dont know that they are safe
374818 this should outrage every american that fox uses hateful language to talk about the person who may be the first black president but the obamas are not the only targets foxs pattern is race baiting and fear mongering regularly focuses on black leaders black institutions and ordinary black people like when they used the solemn occasion of coretta scott kings funeral to call black leaders racist thats not acceptable its offensive to black americans its offensive to all americans thats why i wrote on my new album a song called sly fox watch what you watchin fox keeps feeding us toxin stop sleepin start thinkin

374831 although an honest belief need not be reasonable such a belief is easier to establish where there is a reasonable basis for it
374832 the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture
374833 these documents supply further evidence if any were needed that the justice department authorized the cia to torture prisoners in its custody the justice department twisted the law and in some cases ignored it altogether in order to permit interrogators to use barbaric methods that the us once prosecuted as war crimes
374834 no one welcomes war i recognize the enormous difficulties in afghanistan but my country and yours have a stake in seeing that natos first mission beyond europes borders is a success for the people of afghanistan and for our shared security the work must be done america cannot do this alone
374835 i would rather speak at a rally or a gathering any place outside the united states after i am president of the united states but thats a judgment that senator obama and the american people will make
374836 i feel like justice has been served and in all truth this war criminal the oppressor known as luciano benjamin menendez is going to rot in jail which is exactly what he deserves
374837 the bottom line here is that weve shifted money to help the democratically elected government of pakistan to fight a common foe a common enemy that we have we believe that these upgrades that had already been approved will help the pakistanis us it will help the pakistanis help us fight this common foe and that we believe that this is a positive way to help a friend
374838 we consider this day as a black day in the history of iraqi sport it is a black day as it terminates all the aspirations of the iraqi athletes and their hopes to achieve personal records iraqi records and records for their national unions all these hopes have come to an end this day because of this decision which is done not by iraqi hands but by foreign hands

374850 how can things change if all that comes out of iraq are sanitized white washed images of war designed for mainstream media outlets who focus on making money not on the quality and truth in what they report
374851 im not worried about my own safety im here to do my job im here to document
374852 well theres nothing in the embed rules that say you cant show someone whos identifiable as a marine it says no identifiable features you know to identify that person from you know another person but actually showing an injured soldier or a dead soldier is not something that is barred in the embed rules
374853 by posting the images and your commentary you violated 14 h and o of the news media agreement you signed
374854 by providing detailed information of the effectiveness of the attack and response of us forces to it you have put all us forces in iraq at greater risk for harm

374869 then began the saddest procession i have ever witnessed which the public would never see because cameras were not allowed past the perimeter of the compound driven single file in groups of 10 shackled at the wrists waist and ankles chains dragging as they shuffled through the slaughterhouse workers were brought in for arraignment sat and listened through headsets to the interpreted initial appearance before marching out again to be bused to different county jails only to make room for the next row of 10 they appeared to be uniformly no more than 5 ft tall mostly illiterate guatemalan peasants with mayan last names some in tears others with faces of worry fear and embarrassment

374881 we need more troops more helicopters better intelligence gathering and more nonmilitary assistance to accomplish the mission there
374882 john mccain and george bush both said that if iraq as a sovereign government stated that it was time for us to start withdrawing our troops then they would respect the wishes of that sovereign government and given that i think its also in our strategic interests it certainly strikes me that we shouldnt be writing a status of forces agreement for example that locks in a long term occupation
374883 its 7 00 in the morning its time for him to get up smell the coffee and know the american people are sick and tired of war were already in one quagmire in iraq we dont want another one in iran
374884 and when i got to washington i saw that public policy is really made in a room at a table there were real seats at the table well imagine what has happened to public policymaking now there is a real room with a window and a door and theres two seats at the table the window is for us to look through while our representatives make policy for us so we can see what theyre doing at the table one seat is for the democrats one seat is for the republicans now we dont know who did it but one of them put a lock on the door and slipped a key to the corporate lobbyists who can come and go at will and whisper what they want to democrats and republicans and the result is that we the people who pay for those seats and determine who sits in them want one thing but because the corporate lobbyists can come and go at will our values get overridden and our representatives give us something else thats how we end up with everyone saying theyre against the war and occupation but war and occupation still gets funding thats how we end up with everyone saying theyre against illegal spying on innocent people yet end up with a telecom immunity bill being signed into law thats how we end up with everyone saying theyre in favor of universal access to healthcare and no one supporting what the physicians nurses and healthcare really want and thats a single payer healthcare system in this country

374889 rather than a breakthrough the g8s announcement on 2050 is another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now
374890 the world faces three simultaneous crises a food crisis a climate crisis and a development crisis the three crises are deeply interconnected and need to be addressed as such
374891 now the bush administrations new policy is to wait another ten years
374892 he loved the picture dont get me wrong but he just couldnt get over the war he wasnt joseph anymore joseph never came home
374893 i just feel this war has become so sanitized that it was important to show
374894 provided the enemy with specific information on the effectiveness of the attack
374895 france is one of the ten countries in the world with the highest number of endangered species mainly due to what has happened in its overseas territories and once again the risk of these numbers increasing in the european overseas territories is likely to increase with the growing threat of climate change

374905 though the chinese have also recently begun investing in the countrys oil sector u s companies exxonmobil amerada hess chevron texaco and marathon oil have played the most significant role a report by the international monetary fund notes that u s oil companies receive by far the most generous tax and profit sharing provisions in the region congressional hearings recently revealed how u s oil companies paid hundreds of millions of dollars destined to state treasuries directly into the dictators private bank accounts a senate report faulted u s oil companies for making substantial payments to or entering into business ventures with government officials and their family members
374906 the irony of the relative silence of congress and the bush administration regarding the human rights abuses and the undemocratic nature of obiangs regime is that due to the critical role of u s economic investment and security assistance the united states has far more leverage over the government of equatorial guinea than it does over zimbabwe
374907 equatorial guinea receives u s government funding and training through imet which is international military education and training program in addition the private u s firm military professional resources incorporated mpri founded by former senior pentagon officials who cite the regimes friendliness to u s strategic and economic interests plays a key role in the countrys internal security apparatus

374911 one of the greatest intrusions potentially on the rights of americans protected under the fourth amendment of the us constitution in the history of our country
374912 a federal judge in california said wednesday that the wiretapping law established by congress was the exclusive means for the president to eavesdrop on americans and he rejected the governments claim that the presidents constitutional authority as commander in chief trumped that law

374924 i kept playing the movie over in my head many times had i been pressured had i been stubborn today with the perspective of years behind me i feel it was my destiny i feel that i had to live through what i lived through that i had to find out what i found out i have a ph d in the farc that i hope will be useful to those of us who want to help with all this i think there are moments in life in which one is at a crossroads between what one wants to do and what one has to do
374925 i dont want to answer that question from an emotional perspective because this is such a big blow to the farc that it would be easy to say that the farc is destroyed i simply want to give you testimony of what i lived through since a year ago it has been hard for supplies to arrive we have had little to eat very little variety in the food no fruit no greens thats a signal that the logistics could be going through difficulty
374926 mindless u s support of a regime that tacitly allowed paramilitary groups to function should not be applauded nor should the hundreds of trade union leaders that have been murdered during the uribe presidency be forgotten
374927 i would like to see our continued assistance to countries like colombia and mexico we have just reached an agreement with mexico to try to do what is best for america and that would be to stem the flow of cocaine
374928 i have always said that all options are on the table but the first option for the united states is to solve this problem diplomatically ive also made it clear that you cant solve a problem diplomatically unless there are other people at the table with you and that is why we have been pursuing multilateral diplomacy when it comes to convincing the iranians that the free world is sincere about you know insisting that they not have the technologies necessary to develop a nuclear weapon and were making progress along those lines

374933 when i go to iraq and i have a chance to talk to some of the commanders on the ground im sure ill have more information and will continue to refine my policies
374934 that position has not changed i have not equivocated on that position i am not searching for maneuvering room with respect to that position
374935 i dont think that mental distress qualifies as the health of the mother i think it has to be a serious physical issue that arises in pregnancy where there are real significant problems to the mother carrying that child to term
374936 likely be able to determine the viewing and video uploading habits of youtubes users
374937 we have contributed the least to climate change but we are carrying the heavy burden of solving the climate change problem and so we would like them to ensure that we are included in the negotiations of the climate change convention so that we can contribute more substantially in shaping solutions
374938 the reality is in africa every single day 6 000 people die from hiv aids alone another 7 000 people die from malaria another 2 000 3 000 die from tuberculosis if those numbers of deaths were happening in europe or north america we are convinced the g8 would long time ago have found the money to address these issues so we want to see the same kind of urgency
374939 crime rates and irresponsibility among negroes are a fact of life which must be faced

374944 we were trying to get to the bulldozers we were risking no one and it seems that with the return to tactics and strategies of the first intifada by this village and the movement against the wall it seems that the army is returning to the old commands as well of breaking arms and legs of demonstrators
374945 im here visiting with the good people of nilin on this the fourth anniversary of the landmark advisory opinion and ruling by the international court of justice ruling which as you all know requires cessation of building of the wall destroying or removing the part of it that had been built and also dealing with the issue as a form of colonization and settlement activity with all that comes with that with all that comes with that by way of violation of rights of palestinians including importantly human rights
374946 were very pleased that the judge recognized on the record that my father is neither a threat to the community nor a flight risk we are hoping that immigration and customs enforcement will do the right thing and release him
374947 im not going to retract any of it every word i said was true
374948 we are also sending a message to iran that we will defend american interests and defend the interests of our allies weve done that both by i think you know that in the gulf area the united states has enhanced its security capacity its security presence and we are working closely with all of our allies to make certain that they are capable of defending themselves and we take very very strongly our obligation to help our allies defend themselves and no one should be confused about that

374953 with todays vote the government has been given a green light to expand its power to spy on americans and run roughshod over the constitution
374954 the fact is theyve just tested a missile that has a pretty extended range so my view in the first instance is weve been saying as weve talked about missile defense in europe that there is a real threat and it seems to me that the test this morning underscores that
374955 are we any closer to a military confrontation with iran
374956 but in terms of the missile test i see it as evidence that the missile threat is not an imaginary one and that those who say that there is no iranian missile threat against which we should be building missile defenses perhaps ought to talk to the iranians about their claims even about the distance and the range of the missiles that they test fired
374957 part of what we have to do is get the europeans the chinese the russians all to recognize that its in nobodys interests including irans i believe to have a nuclear weapon that could trigger a nuclear arms race in the region and thats something that i intend to make a number one priority when im in the white house making sure they dont have that nuclear capability
374958 its time for action and its time to make the iranians understand that this kind of violation of international treaties this kind of threatening of their neighbors this kind of continued military activity is not without cost
374959 see barack been talking down to black people on this faith based i wanna cut his beep off
374960 if anything ive said in a hot mic statement thats attributed as distraction i offer apology for that because i dont want harm or hurt to come to this campaign it represents too much of the dreams of so many who have paid such great prices and im very sensitive to what that means
374961 my appeal was for the moral content of his message to not only deal with the personal and moral responsibility of black males but to deal with the collective moral responsibility of government and the public policy
374962 i simply do not feel it is appropriate to honor a person whose epitaph of government service was to have voted against or blocked every civil rights issue that came before the us congress his doctrine of negativity hate and prejudice cost north carolina and our nation much that we may never regain
374963 on the agenda is the necessity of a general pay increase salaries and pensions to compensate not only the constantly increasing cost of living but also inflation
374964 tht says hes awesome so hes awesome and youre stupid if you think otherwise

374991 well thats not my dream i want to come back because gaza is my home and i want to be a voice for the voiceless
374992 do you think those people are going to help you

374997 mohammed you know that greece is not a friend of israel you know that greece is a friend of the palestinians only the palestinians and not israel
374998 well i dont really care and thats none of my business its a country i have received an invitation from the parliament in greece and i went there to speak after or before i went to collect my prize
374999 mohammed is unconscious and he cannot at all do anything or sign any paper
375000 should i tell the dutch embassy they are waiting outside should i tell them to follow us and to come to the hospital tell them that mohammed is inside the ambulance
375001 listen its none of your business dont tell the dutch that mohammed is in this car just take him to the hospital and thats it dont tell anybody about what happened
375002 the former ambassador jan wijenberg said this is by no means an isolated incident but part of a long term strategy to demolish palestinian social economic and cultural life i am aware of the possibility that mohammed omer might be murdered by israeli snipers or bomb attack in the near future
375003 a french kiss bubble bath is the perfect kiss goodnight the fragrances of lavender rosemary and thyme bring to mind a relaxing nap in the french countryside with the thick white bubbles standing in for billowing clouds in a clear blue sky theres no better way to unwind after a long day than a soak in a french kiss bubble bath

375017 christians in name only a call to radical christ following death to christendom
375018 you know faith based groups like east side community ministry carry a particular meaning for me
375019 indeed among the countries for which we have long term data 19 of the 26 countries show rising happiness levels in several of these countries india ireland mexico puerto rico and south korea there are steeply rising trends the other countries with rising trends are argentina canada china denmark finland france italy japan luxembourg the netherlands poland south africa spain and sweden three countries the u s switzerland and norway show flat trends from the earliest to latest available survey only four countries austria belgium the u k and west germany show downward trends almost five times as many countries show rising trends as downward trends
375020 all of us make mistakes but to accept that we have indeed made a mistake is something that comes from exceptionally great people rajnikanth who is born and brought up in karnataka is one such great person
375021 we know rajini belongs to karnataka and we are sure that he had been pressurised to make anti kannada statements but now with this apology he has proved to be a golden hearted personality who is prepared to accept his mistake being an icon in the film industry he has proved that he is also a great human being who can assuage the hurt feelings of people by a simple apology he has really risen in our esteem
375022 the ioc put in place a working group with bocog to start examining one by one those sites on the internet that the international media thought should be unblocked
375023 and they included unusually sites like bbc china for goodness sake deutsche welle amnesty international
375024 some of you will notice already that we started to get agreement to open sites which were previously closed yesterday and thats still occurring
375025 i guess there will be some debate as we move towards the games theres still sites that may or may not be open and the line between what could be considered as a national interest issue might be a bit blurred but we will work on it
375026 and we will deal with any particular grievance reasonable grievance that a journalist or representative of the media may have if they feel they havent got access to a particular site
375027 i think there might have been a case for us to articulate or clear the sorts of sites which might have remained censored
375028 but thats a bit hard if you like to articulate because it changes from time to time
375029 in every country in the world theres sites that are subject to censorship by the government in respect of what they would regard as subversive sites or sites that might endanger or jeopardise national interests
375030 what we were concerned with was that no sites outside of that would be off limits to you to the international media to report on the games here in china
375031 in some cases the effects were similar to those achieved with common anti blood pressure drugs
375032 notices will be served on more doctors in a few days the state government spends more than rs 10 lakh to produce a single doctor the majority of those who pursue medical education and sign a bond with the government to serve the public hospitals and rural areas violate the bond the government reserves the right to take legal action against the errant doctors as their refusal to serve the public hospitals is deemed as gross misutilisation of public money
375033 i am very sorry to say that doctors in assam have developed a negative image across the region recently i attended a meeting of northeast health ministers in imphal where manipur chief minister okram ibobi singh categorically said while the regional institute of medical sciences produces doctors for society gmch produces doctors for private hospitals i sincerely hope that doctors will introspect and serve patients in government hospitals

375063 investors seem to have realized that the business yahoo is in is a very complicated and challenging one and the current macroeconomic environment is even more challenging
375064 so turning over the reins to an unknown quantity doesnt appear to be the prudent thing to do at the moment
375065 at no point did the board and management ever resist microsofts proposal
375066 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts
375067 you are overpaid you have overstayed your welcome you overplayed your hand with microsoft
375068 the commission will remain vigilant in protecting consumers access to content on the internet
375069 a clearly stated commitment of nondiscrimination would make clear that the commission is not having a one night stand with net neutrality but an affair of the heart and a commitment for life
375070 im concerned about anything that would appear to reverse the decade old bipartisan commitment we have against government regulation of the internet
375071 it is our understanding that there are discussions ongoing within law enforcement as to whether the fbi will become involved
375072 only in the last week or so have we confirmed that in fact there are no tickets coming through
375073 we have seen no evidence that anyone has received any tickets the best that we can tell its blatant fraud
375074 i actually tried to expose them way back in february to newspapers and also to the beijing olympics committee
375075 it seems like no one took it seriously until now
375076 if i failed to recognize this internet scam very few other individuals with less of an e commerce background would have had a chance
375077 so i can empathize with others in the same position
375078 ive been in business for 18 years im aware that theres fraud out there
375079 but they looked so legitimate their website was so elaborate
375080 i work for a fairly large software company and the team i manage is responsible for dealing with internet crime
375081 so it was quite amusing to everyone at work that i had been scammed on the internet
375082 the important point im making by talking about this is that this was a bloody good scam
375083 its like one of those boiler room deals in the stock market the huge office and all these people and at the last second they simply shut it down
375084 us swimmer jessica hardy tested positive for the prohibited substance clenbuterol at the us olympic trials on july 4 2008 and has agreed to withdraw from the 2008 united states olympic team in the best interests of the team
375085 come back to the panel to present evidence which could reduce her period of ineligibility
375086 while it is an unfortunate circumstance for an olympian to come this far only to lose a coveted position on the olympic team ms hardy is working expediently and agreeably to resolve the situation with as little impact to the us olympic team as possible
375087 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
375088 as i would not be a slave so i would not be a master this expresses my idea of democracy whatever differs from this to the extent of the difference is no democracy

375090 thousands of hospital patients are in danger of catching deadly superbugs because muslim medical students refuse to follow new hygiene rules the department of health has ordered staff across the country to be bare past the elbow in a bid to halt the spread of infections which are easily hand borne they say the rule is essential to ensure workers are properly able to wash their hands and wrists but female muslim students training in hospitals in england have refused to implement the directive because islam forbids women exposing more than their hands and face in public
375091 no practicing muslim woman doctor medical student nurse or patient should be forced to bare her arms
375092 islamic medicine is defined as the art of practice of medicine in the service of humanity under islamic guidelines as ordained in the divine book and taught by the prophet muhammad

375098 he met her out there they were not a couple they had only known each other for a short time
375099 i dont think that it was racially motivated but i think there are racial overtones to what did happen i think the incident started with a mistaken identity situation but i think that once it escalated to the point of the beating racial overtones came forward remarks that were made insults language that would be racially inflammatory
375100 we have to look at look at how can this happen
375101 they had discovered the radiation leak weeks ago and did not inform the japanese government immediately
375102 the us navys handling of the accident and lack of transparency showed there is no way we can trust them

375108 the beef wasnt just tender it melted everything that surrounded it the fries the red onion the tomato was wokked and seasoned perfectly it was flavorful crisp and alive even the rice was spot on cooked with a hint of chicken broth in a similar manner as hainan chicken rice the starch couldve functioned as a standalone dish
375109 with the recent addition of macchu picchu to the list of 7 wonders of the world peru has been written about in almost every major newspaper over the last twelve months
375110 i must confess to having waited for everyone else at the table to take a piece of the beef heart from the skewer before i tried it myself not being a natural aficionado of offal the texture is quite firm but not chewy in the way that an overcooked piece of steak would be again it is the accompaniment that lifts this entr e from merely being novel meat on a skewer in a tiny dish next to the skewers is a bright orange ground salsa that offers a big kick of chilli that fades away without taking out the taste buds
375111 after lunch we went and had a tasty treat and i am grateful to miguel for it i think he only tells me about local sweets every few days as he fears i will go into a sugar coma this was fried yeasted dough think similar to a funnel cake but not quite covered in sugar cane syrup tasty in lima they make them from pumpkin bunuelos something like this ill find out but i had four there are ladies there who each make them just a tad different so families have their favorite ladies
375112 cebiche i was told that it would be a crime a shameful and unforgivable crime to leave the country of peru without having experienced one of the countrys most beloved national foods cebiche is a dish of raw seafood fish shrimp and stuffed crab in this particular dish marinated with fresh onion garlic cilantro and lemon juice all sitting on top of sweet potato yuca potato and my personal favorite choclos a type of corn seed that does not pop upon roasting rather the inside becomes soft and crunchy like pop corn only more savory and a bit saltier
375113 and the ice cream and juices oh sweet fruits of the amazon there are the typical flavors orange strawberry banana but then you have guarana acerola camu camu and tons of other fruits that ive never even heard of before guarana is one of my favorites when added to juice it adds a slightly bitter flavor which perfectly offsets citrus juices such as orange and pineapple

375121 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
375122 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
375123 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
375124 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
375125 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
375126 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
375127 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
375128 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact

375179 flawed and corrupted many carbon credits schemes and projects including those in the cdm are also threatening the livelihoods and environment of communities in the developing world
375180 viewed through the lens of forests and forest peoples there was little reason to rejoice when governments decided to include carbon sinks as a project category eligible for credits in the cdm even worse governments failed to put meaningful safeguards in place ensuring that environmentally or socially harmful projects were avoided
375181 a huge failure that is actually increasing greenhouse gas emissions behind the guise of promoting sustainable development

375259 ketika tidak ada pantulan uv atau kupu kupu tidak dapat melihat kupu kupu betina terlihat enggan mendekati kupu kupu jantan
375260 seleksi berdasarkan pantulan sinar uv lebih menentukan daripada ukuran pupil
375261 ketika jantan mendekati dan mulai merayu kupu kupu betina dengan membuka dan menutup sayapnya terus menerus sehingga pupil dapat dilihat kupu kupu betina
375262 kami percaya bahwa tujuan kupu kupu jantan mengepak kepakkan sayap adalah untuk menyebarkan feromon hormon kawin ke antena betina dan merangsangnya secara visual betina terlihat sangat sensistif terhadap rayuan ini yang mungkin saja ia lihat sebagai kilauan cahaya yang indah
375263 tapi kami masih belum mengetahui apa yang menyebabkan kupu kupu betina memilih pupil yang relatif kecil dibandingkan dengan pupil yang lebih besar karena seharusnya pupil besar menghasilkan pantulan uv yang lebih banyak

375556 back in february when little known voipshield systems sent a report to cisco nsdq csco avaya nyse av and nortel nyse nt detailing vulnerabilities in their voip technologies the three largest ip pbx vendors on the market shrugged off the report and never responded the vendors began cooperating and acknowledging on their websites of the risks to their voip systems only after voipshield continued reporting the vulnerabilities publicly nortel attributed a vulnerability to voipshield on april 10 for example
375557 but because most of the companies we talk to have cisco voip installed cisco has been extremely responsive to us from the beginning and has reacted quickly to make patches available to their customers doing a google search and finding an exposed voip system has nothing to do with the vendor it was shown to demonstrate how cyber criminals ply their trade and how some companies through carelessness or ignorance make it easy for them
375558 if you want to do business in china jack perkowski is your man in managing the dragon he takes you into the heart of the middle kingdom and shows you the way with insight humor and the kind of practical advice an entrepreneur or a down home tourist needs to navigate this fascinating and often bewildering colossus of a country
375559 ive just finished managing the dragon which i thought was fantastic i was riveted by it i cannot believe what jack perkowski has accomplished and what an adventure hes had how he lived through it how he has succeeded and how well written his book is it reads somewhere between a novel a how to book and primer on a second business life in a developing country
375560 i love jack perkowskis book it tells with some bravado and lots of humility the first hand story of a man who dared himself to move to china to seize upon the greatest economic boom of our age perkowski invites us into his world into the blur of business meetings and friendships hirings firings and onto chinas shop floors he reveals what it took to build a world class manufacturing company in a country that like perkowski himself needed to set firm goals but reach them in an environment where the rules and circles of influence shift daily managing the dragon is more than a manual more than a memoir it is a gift from a seasoned friend offering the keys to his wisdom and experience
375561 managing the dragon is more than a great story about jack perkowski and his courage to move to the new frontier it is a graduate degree in the trials tribulations and successes of starting from scratch in china jack captures the essence of doing business in china and turns it into a very compelling how to guide my experiences in china over the last 14 years validate the accuracy of jack perceptions managing the dragon is superb and will be a must read for any borgwarner executive involved with china
375562 business books on china are published so frequently these days it seems there is a secret factory churning them out
375563 no one should abandon duties because he sees defects in them every action every activity is surrounded by defects as a fire is surrounded by smoke
375564 there is no worse sickness for the soul o you who are proud than this pretense of perfection
375565 its a bonus for anyone like me who didnt know what to do with coins and didnt throw them away
375566 everyone is totally confused maybe things will settle down in a few days its farcical at the moment
375567 when the righteous truth from his righteousness and committed iniquity he shall even die thereby but if the wicked turn from his wickedness and do that which is lawful and right he shall live thereby
375568 the lord will fight my case and i shall hold my peace

375611 we are thrilled to have gary kayye as our keynote speaker
375612 mr kayye has distinguished himself for many years as a visionary technology leader and friend of education and there is no one more qualified to set the tone for the first educomm conference at infocomm
375613 gary has made tremendous contributions in helping organizations use av and presentation technologies effectively
375614 and his keynote at educomm will provide a dynamic vision that education leaders can take back to their school districts and campuses
375615 educomm is a tremendous opportunity for education buyers to keep on top of today eur tm s system capabilities as well as to know what to expect next year and the year after that

375619 look this is urgent my new boss stella pennipincher just stormed into my office and demanded to know why the college is sending me and my managers on an all expense paid vacation to las vegas next week next week is infocomm and i tried to explain to her that i go every year but she kinda swooped in and stormed out what do i do
375620 i know infocomm is an expensive proposition and bender has certainly had a tough year budget wise but we have to stay on top of new tech and i depend on networking with colleagues to get ideas for how we can reduce our classroom costs heck infocomms roi has saved bender college big bucks over the years but stellas all about how if its not in writing it never happened
375621 what am i supposed to do write a report on what i learned at infocomm
375622 actually i used to have our people give presentations after they returned but that became too time consuming and offered too little shelf life for some very useful information i dont care to invest time in gathering valuable information if no ones going to benefit from it and i want our people to know that what theyre doing makes a lasting contribution
375623 right we like to say that we transfer the knowledge gained from our infocomm outings directly into better classrooms and services but what if thats just not enough
375624 no im afraid its no longer sufficient for any of us merely to do good work and its not unreasonable to expect something a bit more tangible and immediate from ones returning conferees lets face it bucky next week at infocomm youll discover innovative products services and ideas that will simplify your life and improve your customers experience
375625 hey i know what youre saying its our job to find a way to get it done better faster cheaper
375626 look bucky while youre at infocomm youre going to take pictures and bookmark websites right so why not post them to flickr and share them with your peers these tools are easy to use and did i mention free your boss may be amazed by your powers of organization
375627 i dont know it sounds like just a lot of showing off to me

375680 die umsetzung von einem so komplexen regelwerk das seit 25 jahren existiert und viele feinheiten und optionale regeln aufweist ist nat rlich nicht so einfach alleine die 250 zauberspr che die dsa kennt konnten wir nat rlich nicht alle bernehmen trotzdem sind wir sehr sorgf ltig vorgegangen wir haben die regeln zuerst 1 1 bernommen und dann geschaut funktioniert das auf dem pc macht es spa wenn es probleme gab haben wir ganz vorsichtig justiert immer in absprache mit der dsa redaktion und den fans jeder dsa spieler wird sich in drakensang zu hause f hlen auch wenn wir das eine oder andere detail ein wenig ver ndert haben

375719 we have not come here to fight we are here for information
375720 astrid perhaps asking a guard who never eats would be a waste and instead you ask for someone who would spare some
375721 we seek an audience with an individual known as am might you know where we might locate them
375722 the crime is either kidnapping or theft that is what we are here to determine
375723 i thought it was her sister that she was asking about
375724 were perfectly amiable to returning the warforged to am should they request it
375725 i am sorry we meant no disrespect standing outside your door for so long but we were unsure of what to say to the great am
375726 i am takai and behind me is someone you may recognize gear hat it is an honor
375727 actually we are not looking for a return gear hat is quite impressive to say the least the only issue i have is that i was not given the code name to unlock his civilian mode in case the need ever arose
375728 iann you should speak to her he is the most well versed among us
375729 why do you hang around these dullards surely they couldnt offer you much in the way of intelligent conversation your companions are fairly grating and rude you know
375730 this warforged designation gear hat was found on the streets of sigil the city of doors which you are undoubtedly familiar with
375731 well you see we did not have an opportunity to deal with a reseller at all this warforged construct was found in a deactivated state in the middle of the street
375732 actually the construct was activated through a service contracted by my associate here
375733 yes but fortunately for him the warforged was intelligently programmed to warn him about the dangers of its free thinking civilian mode
375734 now back to how the warforged came into our possession we have concluded that it had been left there accidentally by a group of abishai as they made their way from one portal to another
375735 or putting them to use in a war of their own
375736 we do not know how these abishai came into possession of your constructs but a group of lawkeepers known as the harmonium have become interested
375737 we will not come to your aide should those wolves turn against you this is your task alone
375738 the harmonium wants to stop what they consider the illegal trade of your warforged constructs
375739 it would seem that they have no law concerning goods but they do have one which applies to sentient beings which you yourself have confirmed warforged are not
375740 judging by what you said earlier you have not dealt with any of these abishai directly
375741 thank you for your hospitality miss alice i would be interested to come back and learn from you some time when im not looking for my sister
375742 have you checked your inventory recently might they have been stolen from here
375743 i think this sister of hers exists only in the air space between her ears
375744 you misunderstand we do not claim to own this particular warforged and will return it to whomever is the proper owner should we discover whom that is
375745 we are certain that these abishai have procured these warforged from this plane we retracted their path back here
375746 not as of yet but i am not part of this particular expedition for the coin but merely to increase my own knowledge that is the reward i seek
375747 you have noticed the food she had brought here have you not
375748 you have said that a warforged is merely a tool but this one here claims independant thought
375749 it stayed outside but it referred to itself as a songforged if i am not mistaken
375750 so what you are saying as that these constructs are capable of feigning intelligence
375751 it has a similar structure though lighter and clearly not meant for combat
375752 perhaps but its unique abilities did act as the key which activated the portal to your plane
375753 when did you have an opportunity to locate buyers for ams work
375754 i am you are resolving many things with simple words
375755 i will take this to torvald of the harmonium immediately
375756 i need to see on astrid for a moment please excuse me
375757 i need to kill something very very badly i dont think i can take it longer
375758 i usually cannot abide killing the innocent but in this rare case i may make an exception want to find those wolves
375759 i believe i will retire for the night thank you for the hospitality you have shown us
375760 no i do not and would it be wise to entice them back in this direction
375761 we have not come here to fight we are here for information
375762 we seek an audience with an individual known as am might you know where we might locate them
375763 with this many guards one would think stealing these constructs would be quite a bit more difficult
375764 with that even if we cannot get him to help us further wed have something
375765 then why would the harmonium bother giving us this task
375766 the crime is either kidnapping or theft that is what we are here to determine
375767 i thought it was her sister that she was asking about
375768 were perfectly amiable to returning the warforged to am should they request it
375769 takai may do the talking if he chooses to i will be there to assist when he falters in some fashion
375770 master artisan hah youre probably nowhere near as good as i am
375771 actually we are not looking for a return gear hat is quite impressive to say the least the only issue i have is that i was not given the code name to unlock his civilian mode in case the need ever arose
375772 are any of your companions smarter than you it seems like someone bought you that thing as a gift so are they here i dont usually waste time talking to idiots
375773 i was thrown in with them if you will a rather unfortunate series of circumstances
375774 this warforged designation gear hat was found on the streets of sigil the city of doors which you are undoubtedly familiar with
375775 it is little more than a crossroads the real places of interest seem to lie behind the doors or portals as they are better known
375776 well you see we did not have an opportunity to deal with a reseller at all this warforged construct was found in a deactivated state in the middle of the street
375777 actually the construct was activated through a service contracted by my associate here
375778 im prety sure i told you what it was before you activated it takai
375779 yes but fortunately for him the warforged was intelligently programmed to warn him about the dangers of its free thinking civilian mode
375780 now back to how the warforged came into our possession we have concluded that it had been left there accidentally by a group of abishai as they made their way from one portal to another
375781 slavery you cant make them slaves theyre tools not people
375782 or putting them to use in a war of their own
375783 we do not know how these abishai came into possession of your constructs but a group of lawkeepers known as the harmonium have become interested
375784 we will not come to your aide should those wolves turn against you this is your task alone
375785 the harmonium wants to stop what they consider the illegal trade of your warforged constructs
375786 it would seem that they have no law concerning goods but they do have one which applies to sentient beings which you yourself have confirmed warforged are not
375787 judging by what you said earlier you have not dealt with any of these abishai directly
375788 thank you for your hospitality miss alice i would be interested to come back and learn from you some time when im not looking for my sister
375789 have you checked your inventory recently might they have been stolen from here
375790 i think this sister of hers exists only in the air space between her ears
375791 you misunderstand we do not claim to own this particular warforged and will return it to whomever is the proper owner should we discover whom that is
375792 we are certain that these abishai have procured these warforged from this plane we retracted their path back here
375793 not as of yet but i am not part of this particular expedition for the coin but merely to increase my own knowledge that is the reward i seek
375794 you have noticed the food she had brought here have you not
375795 you have said that a warforged is merely a tool but this one here claims independant thought
375796 of course they actually have their own minds so they can make intelligent decisions even when they have stupid owners im sure tacky over there would be most grateful for that
375797 you have said that a warforged is merely a tool but another construct which travels with us claims independant thought
375798 it stayed outside but it referred to itself as a songforged if i am not mistaken
375799 so what you are saying as that these constructs are capable of feigning intelligence
375800 it has a similar structure though lighter and clearly not meant for combat
375801 perhaps but its unique abilities did act as the key which activated the portal to your plane
375802 when did you have an opportunity to locate buyers for ams work
375803 clearly not if you do not mind id like to watch you work for a time
375804 we are sad to hear of the apparent death of this gentleman mr al masri and we extend our condolences to his family

376127 australia has always had difficulty achieving an independent and balanced foreign policy the tendency to depend on great and powerful friends whether in defence or foreign policy has long been an entrenched part of our political culture indeed that we should locate our national identity in the anzac spirit which saw the death of countless australian soldiers on anzac cove in a high risk british led operation is a telling symbol of that dependence our whole hearted support for the united states in the cold war and our involvement in the vietnam war are other indicators such dependence was also responsible for australias mistaken policy in the 1960s opposing chinas bid to obtain a seat in the united nations more recently the governments participation in the war on iraq despite the opposition of the majority of the australian people similarly stemmed from the governments inability to conceive of our own self interest as separate from that of our allies
376128 i attend many international meetings and frequently observe the australian delegation taking their orders from the us delegation whenever blocks sticky questions differences of opinions over language or bracketed text come up one or more of the australian delegates walks over to the us table and asks for instructions they also meet them in corridors behind the meeting rooms and near the toilets to exchange bits of paper and get their text instructions interventions from the australian delegation are eerily similar to the preceding intervention from the us delegate and barring the very very odd exception australians are not known to disagree publicly with them this is also obvious to other delegations who are astonished that australian officials cant seem to think for themselves and seem to gang up with the us to erode consensus time and again the issue is complicated by the uss starring role as an international pariah of foreign policy

376140 no one can read these prescriptions without thinking first of how many practical and theoretical questions they raise and second and more dishearteningly of how remote they are from the present configuration of the world both as this is anchored in institutions and as it is registered in consciousness we need not elaborate these points which should be instantly recognizable to all but we would insist that they be taken in their proper perspective our project is neither to lay out every step of this way nor to yield to the adversary because of the preponderance of power he sic holds it is rather to develop the logic of a sufficient and necessary transformation of the current order and to begin developing the intermediate steps towards this goal we do so in order to think more deeply into these possibilities and at the same moment begin the work of drawing together with all those of like mind if there is any merit in these arguments then it must be the case that similar thoughts and practices to realize these thoughts will be coordinatively germinating at innumerable points around the world ecosocialism will be international and universal or it will be nothing the crises of our time can and must be seen as revolutionary opportunities which it is our obligation to affirm and bring into existence

376214 people who are going to china should take a clean computer one with no data at all
376215 what the chinese tried to do was infiltrate their security to see who in china the tibet movement was talking to

376223 claro que animo a las parejas casadas a rezar para que tengan una buena y feliz vida sexual para ellos es un medio de acercarse a dios
376224 la gente est un poco sorprendida al principio pero agradablemente sorprendida
376225 si crees en dios crees que dios est presente en la vida en el amor en el matrimonio y en la sexualidad parece natural hablar de sexo y suprimir algunos tab es y etiquetas del pecado
376226 el amor de una pareja casada expresado en el sexo acerca el cuerpo humano al cielo el xtasis de una relaci n sexual puede compararse a la alegr a de la vida eterna
376227 por eso este acto conyugal permite a los esposos empezar a entender la dulzura del encuentro con dios

376229 so this huge thunderstorm hits when me and the wife are coming back from lake anna
376230 i looked at my wife and said honey as long as were movin were okay
376231 then the question is do you have adequate drain holes
376232 the thing i want people to understand is that i am very excited and i am honored and i am humbled
376233 but the thing is i could not be the leader i am if i did not have the support and dedication and commitment of my staff students and parents
376234 we did a lot of mainstreaming special education students into our regular classes and we did a lot of co teaching
376235 its not just the special education teacher working with special education students its both that teacher and the general education teacher working with all the students
376236 we did a lot of sat tutoring and prep on the weekends this past year
376237 i remember my parents buying me a little chalkboard for christmas
376238 when my parents said go to your room i would say to my younger brothers lets play a game of school and ill play teacher
376239 i really wanted to establish a team effort among teachers to create a positive and welcoming school culture
376240 then i said to myself the fbi doesnt normally give up on cases
376241 this is sort of a defining line that we can put all this behind us that it wont happen again to anyone else
376242 all this time since 2001 there has been much said about what our government wasnt doing and here we find out all these years later that the government was busy and actively investigating
376243 and for that i say thank you to the government
376244 people say to me why would you trust first nations
376245 i think its a healthy thing to see environmental groups involved and speaking out and negotiating whether its with a first nations government a federal government a provincial government or even a government of another country
376246 we want a place where ideas are spoken about and we collectively try to get to a good place thats why the prospect of disagreeing with a first nations government doesnt concern me im not freaked out at all i think this is a healthy situation
376247 canada at the time had i guess concluded the arrow lakes band had become extinct because there were no living members of the band
376248 in the governments eyes theres no arrow lake indian band its not recognized
376249 they were deemed extinct according to the rules of canada anyway there were hundreds of them down on the colville reservation and so they were considered an extinct group and that was the end of it from the canadian governments perspective
376250 the federal government had decided that because aboriginal people were not listed on their band list that there were no longer lakes people or sinixt people living and that was not true there were sinixt people many of them descendents living in the united states and there were also lakes people who had intermarried and were living among the okanagan nations in the okanagan valley
376251 its totally absurd and its an anomaly that needs to be rectified
376252 the sinixt band and their reserve at burton british columbia is the only band thats been declared extinct in the province ever and its the only band thats had their land taken away from them and its an outrage its never happened before this is a wrong that needs to be remedied
376253 an aboriginal people within the meaning of the constitution act
376254 it will have that incidental effect but the point of the litigation would be to have the arrow lakes people secured in their land in their traditional territory in the arrow lakes region of british columbia
376255 the governments are going to say oh well these people have disappeared somehow they think in their mind that a whole nation of people evaporates
376256 were managing but the end of the day cant come too soon its been busy all over town we had a trucker come in yesterday delivering groceries who said he couldnt cross the street because there was so much traffic
376257 we are definitely seeing many more people and so were putting more officers on the road
376258 so far its been fine not many accidents no big problems
376259 there are a lot of people driving through here who normally would not and theyre getting the opportunity to see what spectacular country this is weve always been b c s little secret and im hoping these people will come back and visit
376260 its hopping in lytton the last three days weve had not quite double the number of customers im running out of product being an isolated area we get food deliveries once a week and when we get hit like this its pretty tricky
376261 for the most part were going to be down theres no question but it is an opportunity for people to come to whistler and get some amazing deals here
376262 obviously there have been some cancellations but many things are still going on the four seasons resort is having a convention this weekend and theyre going ahead weve just got to show them a good time
376263 we are hoping that we are going to get in there and get started moving the muck off the road pretty quickly
376264 there is noise emitted as the seal between two planes breaks and once it starts it becomes more detectable and noisier for want of a better phrase so by monitoring this through a sophisticated electrical filter you can tell when something is about to happen
376265 where we are building we dont have any sizable cliffs that would be going near housing
376266 its a little nerve wracking for me shes so good and so gifted and talented and experienced so i think im going to learn a lot from working with her
376267 i was overwhelmed with everything like the phone calls and offers and congratulations it gave me a lot of visibility
376268 ive been able to build sort of a wall of nos around me knowing to say no to this no to that
376269 this is what i need in order to be able to do the work that is expected of me
376270 almost everything from the way she will be dressed to how she will arrive how she will be prepared how she will act with the musicians the conductors which questions shes going to ask just her way of working her way of approaching music of interpreting and understanding music how she works through the music and with people around her
376271 you know they will or else theyll run me out of town
376272 when i learned that it was going to be her on the bill i was really thrilled

376274 a great opportunity to talk about sports and health and to hear from aboriginal youth maybe ill try to set up on a sidewalk somewhere but we wont have the same visibility
376275 this is not just bringing them in to compete exchange high fives and go away
376276 this is an agent for social change it is about cultural support and spirituality
376277 aboriginal sports leaders from canada and the united states many years ago saw the challenges that exist in our communities social issues that put our young people at risk
376278 people are fed up with the underrepresentation of aboriginal athletes and coaches in mainstream sport and they saw the preventative power that sport had in our communities
376279 many will go on to greater things like the olympics
376280 but these games are about creating healthier more vibrant communities
376281 i really want to break a lot of national times
376282 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
376283 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
376284 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
376285 do you think you are better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago if you arent better off can you afford another four years
376286 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
376287 it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down your own debt
376288 we are determined to continue the raid until we arrest all those involved
376289 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products
376290 as a result our downstream operations incurred a loss in the second quarter with most of the loss taking place in the united states
376291 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
376292 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
376293 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
376294 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
376295 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
376296 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
376297 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
376298 represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning
376299 do you think you are better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago if you arent better off can you afford another four years

376604 bohr once commented that a person who wasnt outraged on first hearing about quantum theory didnt understand what had been said
376605 the steven levitt tends to see things differently than the average person differently too than the average economist this is either a wonderful trait or a troubling one depending on how you feel about economists
376606 im not good at math i dont know a lot of econometrics and i also dont know how to do theory if you ask me about whether the stock markets going to go up or down if you ask me whether the economys going to grow or shrink if you ask me whether deflations good or bad if you ask me about taxes i mean it would be total fakery if i said i knew anything about any of those things

376610 they need to be much smarter after the verdict and i think tayyip erdogan is aware of this basic fact
376611 the ak party will be more moderate i think in dealing with the constitution in dealing with the opposition and in dealing with other sensitive issues
376612 the akp has been given a yellow card until next time this is a verdict that will keep the akp under strict observation
376613 it will always keep the threat of closure over the party the debate and struggle for enhanced democracy will continue with the same sensitivities alive
376614 maybe they akp will think that they should put an end to this process so as not to cause problems with the army maybe they will be happy with the constitutional court decision and think that after a year or two they can deal with the issue if they behave like this it means that they do not understand the seriousness of the deep state problem in turkey
376615 continue calls for consensus in the sense of very radical concessions from the akp side and not touch hot potatoes such as the kurdish issue and the head scarf issue
376616 the case and the crisis more broadly appears to have accomplished the much needed task of awakening turkeys centrist forces which had been ejected from the mainstream in 2002

376626 biblical theology is neither the story of humanitys search for god nor is it a description of a history of religious experience biblical theology is theo logy it is primarily a story about god and his concern for human beings it exists only because of the divine initiative realizing itself in a series of divine acts whose objective is human redemption biblical theology therefore is not exclusively or even primarily a system of abstract theological truths it is basically the description and interpretation of the divine activity within the scene of human history that seeks humanitys redemption
376627 the mission of jesus brought not a new teaching but a new event it brought to people an actual foretaste of the eschatological salvation jesus did not promise the forgiveness of sins he bestowed it he did not simply assure people of the future fellowship of the kingdom he invited them into fellowship with himself as the bearer of the kingdom he did not merely promise them vindication in the day of judgment he bestowed upon them the status of a present righteousness he not only taught an eschatological deliverance from physical evil he went about demonstrating the redeeming power of the kingdom delivering people from sickness and even death
376628 the main reason for their enmity with this nation in the past 30 years is that they want to force the iranian nation to retreat

376639 i worship at the church of your ass when i pray and eat from your ass thats my communion
376640 he should have rollled up his sleeves and laid into the tories instead we got a lecture on oil prices and how difficult everything is
376641 he will get his retaliation in first with a massive relaunch and a massive this or that and everyone will wait and see if it works
376642 it would have been helpful to see some tentative feet being put forward by some non uber blairite wing to say there was some intelligence in the article
376643 he is poised on the edge of a cliff it will only take a small mistake for him to slip and plunge down in the end the public will decide they may just say they do not want brown and if that happens labour backbenchers will follow and if that happens miliband is now clearly there waiting to try and take his chance

376706 if this animal was left it would have a much longer lingering death clearly the animal is suffering
376707 we understand that many people find the idea of consuming even trace amounts of animal products to be gross but our primary focus is on preventing harm to animals eating something that has been cooked in the same oil in which chicken flesh has also been cooked doesnt cause any harm to animals and deciding not to get that sandwich wont prevent the chicken from being ordered cooked and eaten anyway

376778 most thais dont like too strong a smell except some old people
376779 making a non smelly durian is like a thornless rose
376780 if the durian doesnt have a strong smell the customer only pays one third the price
376781 durian makes you hot and alcohol makes you hot so its double heat
376782 its an opportunity for us to export more to new markets that dont like the strong smell
376783 to anyone who doesnt like durian it smells like a bunch of dead cats
376784 but as you get to appreciate durian the smell is not offensive at all its attractive it makes you drool like a mastiff

376792 i dont think its such a bad thing if for 15 minutes you take off your reporter hat and respond to obama as a human being at an event where youre surrounded by people of color and youre here for a united cause
376793 aim of new unity initiative is more diversity in top media management
376794 with more than 50 percent of the population projected to be people of color in less than a generation

376804 jacob zuma will lead the ancs election campaign we are not assuming that he will be absent for it we have made a commitment to zuma to be at his side at court and we will be at his side when he goes to the union buildings
376805 it is a political case this is the first time ive seen a case where an accused has had to wait for five years for charges to be laid and ive also never seen charges change as often as they have with zuma
376806 we fight them in every room and in every street
376807 there is a trend that when our rand is trading less favourably against the major currencies south africans look to move money offshore and in this regard they look at property as an investment
376808 conversely when the rand is strong against the dollar and pound there is more positive sentiment about the country and outflow decreases
376809 there is still interest in france where we see demand for rural properties requiring renovation and earmarked for holiday or retirement use
376810 we are also receiving enquiries for australia for investment and emigration purposes as well as dubai
376811 due to the weakness of the us dollar internationally and the fact that property prices have dropped significantly in the united states we are still receiving strong interest in the building the chicago spire where the starting price is 800 000
376812 south africans with money want to invest in the overseas market to diversify their investment to hedge risk in the local market even though they are not willing to relocate there themselves
376813 the developments are specifically geared for overseas investors wanting a perfect spot under the south american sun for a retreat
376814 we believe belize is the next gold rush in property terms and now is the time for investors to get involved
376815 there is no guarantee as to where the rand will be in 10 years and people cannot take the chance of seeing their investment diminish by the amounts that could occur with a rand based investment

376840 we are constantly told as members of congress that companies operating out of china are actively seeking to do business in this arena in the u s and this effort by the department represents a real vulnerability
376841 its clear that with this directive theyve decided to thwart the intent and the wishes of congress
376842 now he sends a letter in opposition whats it going to be conflicting messages arent helpful
376843 not required to follow the standards identified in the buy american act
376844 our ports should only buy equipment and materials produced outside of the united states if such is unavailable within the united states or of the purchase of such material and equipment domestically would not be in our countrys best interest
376845 congressman thompson raises some valid points and we will be interested in secretary chertoffs reply
376846 when an american product will satisfy the need then they clearly should buy that
376847 but if theres a product that is better and cheaper we need to get the best thats available anywhere in many areas technology is now global the majority of defense weapons systems have foreign parts in them in many areas the united states is not on the leading edge and we want to make sure we buy the best products for our security
376848 well hopefully get together on this and come up with some solutions whereby american companies and workers can have an opportunity to be a part of these efforts
376849 dhs cant just decide which laws to follow and which laws to ignore
376850 disregarding buy american requirements for port security grants will send more jobs overseas and could weaken security at the ports taxpayer money shouldnt be used in a wal mart model of shopping the globe for the cheapest goods
376851 they should not get any waivers and no 2 they should buy from american companies and also anyone trying to kill that provision should be shot
376852 she locks herself in her room day in and day out thinking about how to get you out of jail thats all she talks about is you
376853 im not proud of what i have done im committed to making wiser decisions and better choices
376854 im troubled quite frankly by the statement by mr price that hes not proud of what he did but hopes to make wiser decisions
376855 to rape in the name of god is evil in the way few things can be
376856 he just made a bad decision im asking for mercy today
376857 there were times when he was not happy with the intensity of the discussion sort of like how can you question what i want to do here
376858 my jaw hit the table when i saw his name
376859 very distressed by it all and curious about what the fbi thinks they have
376860 one of the largest and most complex in the history of law enforcement
376861 to this day virtually all communications with federal agencies are through the internet and it started because of that event
376862 have significant obligations to the victims of these attacks and their families that must be fulfilled
376863 when you are hunted by the government you can never fully recover your reputation or your peace of mind
376864 theres no question in cases like dr hatfill and dr lee that you are never made whole
376865 a person who has the full force of the governments investigative resources directed toward them suffers a tremendous amount of pressure during the course of that investigation which is only compounded immeasurably if you are innocent
376866 you wonder day to day when the other shoe is going to drop or if there is another shoe to drop
376867 if individuals subject to criminal investigation could simply sue the government every time they were acquitted it would have a very chilling effect on law enforcement and federal prosecutors duties and obligations to investigate criminal activity
376868 we dont want prosecutors and law enforcement looking over their shoulder every time they make investigative and prosecutorial decisions
376869 its as if you have a scarlet letter on your shirt or blouse basic decisions are put on hold because you dont know what the outcome of the investigation is going to be
376870 for 88 days lived with the fear that he would be falsely accused in connection to a terrorist bombing which carries with it the death penalty if convicted
376871 because of the leaks from government sources coupled with the media frenzy richard had two of the most powerful entities in the world bearing down on him the government and the media
376872 thats the lesson from the anthrax case the incentive should be for the government to behave itself and to seek justice in a way that is appropriate
376873 one could jump to the conclusion of guilt or one could jump to the conclusion of the mental stress of being accused of a crime you didnt commit
376874 listen i think everyone hopes this will bring some luck
376875 eclipses were reported where none took place in areas of political or bureaucratic strife
376876 wed already known about this eclipse many years before we got the right to host the olympics so how can we explain this is retribution

376879 have developed a number of vaccines and prophylaxes against disease that have really helped to protect our soldiers in places which are environmentally dirty battlefields
376880 youre trying to bring a closure to it but it keeps coming back at you
376881 curseen and i used to pray together i knew them both quite intimately of course it brings back memories i often have thought about what mrs morris and mrs curseen could be going through while a perpetrator is out on the street walking free i hope now they can find some happiness knowing that that person is no longer out in the world creating harm
376882 its either made right on this side of the grave or the other
376883 nobody gets by with anything but we do just have to wait on the lord
376884 seems as though all of us that survived are going through the same physical and mental problems physically a lot of us have this problem where we dont have that much energy i think for the most part a lot of us have problems with short term memory loss
376885 we dont take any solace in the death of this individual
376886 he has not been tried in a court of law so we do not conclude just based upon the news reports that he was guilty
376887 the previous individual that the fbi targeted was found to be innocent
376888 there is no closure for the postal community with his demise
376889 its still an open issue if the government decides to go forward with a complete review of the evidence and a final decision as to who was responsible well weigh that as its presented
376890 we recognize that terror is still a factor in the lives of citizens all over the planet and recognize that we are not 100 percent safe
376891 we feel safer but were not totally safe we recognize that theres still the possibility of a repeat of the events of 2001
376892 were been anticipating a development or a suspect to be apprehended but never would i have imagined a story like this still the fact is that this particular person who was going to be charged is deceased theres no trail theres no evidence theres no closure it just opens the wound even further

376900 i was trying too hard said ramirez who practically came out of the batters box on one swing and miss
376901 it looked like he was all set up for something spectacular dodgers manager joe torre said
376902 youll have to talk to joe because im not sure what is going on yet garciaparra said at a time when it was clear he had been shelved because his name wasnt listed on the lineup card as either a starter or a reserve
376903 its getting better a lot faster than they anticipated so well see what happens
376904 he still has a ways to go before he is a shortstop who can go to his left and go to his right torre said
376905 he was resistant to it based on the fact he was getting better and felt he could help this ballclub but i explained to him that shortstop seems to be the spot where were going to need him and in order to play shortstop we need him as healthy as possible
376906 when he looked at it that way i think he understood
376907 i will be looking like a baby now ramirez said
376908 they have some rules here and i dont want them to treat me differently from the other guys if they want me to cut my hair i will cut it dont worry it will grow back
376909 podemos utilizar todos los tipos de almid n pero en china el del ma z no es demasiado caro

376916 im just a stay at home bainbridge island mom with a busy 4 year old who has the passion to rid the world of plastic produce bags
376917 theyre really not necessary because most people just put their produce in the crisper and then just throw them away
376918 its a terrible waste and something like my product is a perfectly reasonable alternative
376919 are not boring and can be reused again and again
376920 because there are so many blogs out there now im getting a lot of interest just posting on the blogs and through my own web site
376921 it could get bigger when i approach the grocery stores but for now im happy just dealing with online buyers
376922 when people find out they didnt win most of the time they ask more questions about the product and then purchase a four pack
376923 word of mouth is really working for me because the product is easy to buy and can last forever and its green
376924 people are too i did an eco fest in april and sold out of 65 bags in a few hours
376925 i think so because ive got a process that works
376926 i dont want to turn this into a big corporation but i do want to be successful at it because its an important product
376927 if i have to hire people ill definitely go that way im a great multi tasker and i dont see any reason why i cant make a go of it
376928 it helps being in the northwest because people here are obviously very conscious of what is happening to the environment but more and more thats happening everywhere in the country
376929 he said it was great idea and that i had to do it
376930 there are a lot of things to do in running a business that are challenging so this is not just some romantic idea but its great to be doing something that you really believe in
376931 im going at it one bag one day at a time
376932 i do it in such a fun way that they dont even know why theyre doing it they just know theyre having a good time doing it
376933 getting inside the heads of my students and determining whats going to make them succeed
376934 the concepts have collided its a culmination of everything ive been doing for the past decade
376935 you know what i really believe is that we all have limitations
376936 if we can have any experience that is met with energy and support and move with it what you find out is that were all in the middle of it
376937 there were 169 teams and over 2 100 players vying for the state little league championship to finish in the final three is a great accomplishment for our team
376938 it is an achievement all island little leaguers can be proud of
376939 the team batting average was 406 and pitching and defense were terrific they were such a fun team to be a part of
376940 the parents were wonderful too having logged over 800 miles traveling to cheer the kids on at the district and state tournaments
376941 id also like to express my thanks to the many people who came to support out team
376942 go into the water with an anchor tied to her legs
376943 its a way to give back to the league and its also a lot of fun to do
376944 for a handful hockey is a big part of their lives but there are players who have never played hockey before that want to try it out
376945 what we try very hard to do is sponsor a feeling of community
376946 this season weve expanded the role of teens whove been there for several years and had them coaching more teams all four division ii teams this year were coached by teens
376947 its gone from more adults contributing to more kids contributing almost every ref and coach was an adult now theres hardly any adults coaching
376948 it gives them role models if the younger kids can see the older kids reffing and coaching theyll want to do it too its just a good thing for the league in general to have everyone contribute on one level or another
376949 theyve both been as involved for as long as i have
376950 adults have more experience but with teens coaching the enthusiasm is higher plus the little kids want to be like the big guy
376951 it was probably harder when youre playing because when youre on the bench youre shouting the whole game and telling them what to do
376952 when youre going out and playing its hard to pass information on to your teammates
376953 but there wasnt any loss of respect by the players
376954 it wasnt like there was a fight for power or anything like that everybody listened
376955 he definitely had the respect of his players theyre not going to abuse the fact that hes the coach and screw around all practice theyre going to listen but theyre not going to be afraid of him
376956 in that case one choice is no mayor then youd have candidates running for mayor and someones going to win
376957 a ballot proposition proposing that a noncharter code city change its plan of government may be voted upon only at the next general election after the petitions are submitted occurring in an odd numbered year
376958 essentially the statute is ambiguous it admits several interpretations and none of them are frivolous
376959 our goal really is for the community to have an opportunity to look at this issue its been talked about for so long why not give people a chance to vote on it
376960 theres an increasing sense that whether youre for or against keeping the mayor position the question needs to be settled
376961 to me its very very unfortunate the attorney generals office construed the law that way
376962 that would be very awkward but i personally feel the citizens ought to be given the opportunity to decide which government structure works best for them
376963 im just real nervous when i read that you want to regulate my property 200 feet back from the water
376964 the reason theres 200 people here is most of us dont trust you the city government and we dont trust the administration and we dont trust some ubiquitous person called staff
376965 if you take our property rights away what were going to do is were going to get together and were going to sue you and we all know you always lose you lose our tax money so please think very carefully about this
376966 im scared to death of the water coming right up i wish we had this ordinance a hundred years ago im very much in support of any restrictions you can do for the shoreline i would not mind being taxed if i could have a safer environment that supports puget sound as well as my home on the shore
376967 we were scared to death because it looked like people were going to come in our home and take away our ability to enjoy our homes
376968 nobody on this island is more concerned with what goes on at the waters edge than people who look out at it every morning from their kitchen
376969 the value of my property and of living near the shoreline is not just looking at that water
376970 it is enjoying the natural resources it is knowing that that system is functioning and functioning well we all play a part im willing to play my part i support what youre trying to do

376972 its greed and im sorry to put it that way but its true
376973 all the kids fought hard and played their hearts out
376974 all the playoff games were close which is what happens when youve got balanced teams
376975 if you were lucky enough to be in the stands you would have seen a rink of hard skating lots of cheering and plenty of fun
376976 we were outhustled the first two periods but in the third something clicked
376977 before we went on the rink i told my team right now they canucks want it more if you want it you have to get it the canucks arent going to give you anything no lead is safe
376978 while i was confident we could do it i think all of us were in shock when we won the championship
376979 for us the championship game was heart breaking the red wings played a little better and came out on top but i can proudly say we left nothing on the table
376980 my clients are willing to meet with people at any time and any place but not like this just coming here makes it look like we are guilty
376981 this effort gives me hope that we will eventually solve the problems with our local government for it reinforces what can happen when people work together
376982 perhaps we can reward the senior center by fixing the hole in their roof something cut out of the most recent city budget
376983 i spent last friday with him i had never met him before but we clicked immediately he was a very lively person
376984 when he left i cried because i had a strange feeling that i would never see him again
376985 there is no harder job than being leader of an opposition its tough its unrelenting you have my total goodwill my total support
376986 peter costello has earned the right to make the decision about his future with his own family in the best interests of both them and the people of higgins
376987 as ive said privately and publicly i would be very happy for peter costello to stay on in the parliament
376988 there seems to be this code of silence or lack of trust in the police
376989 the first 48 hours of any homicide investigation are critical weve passed that now were in for the long haul

377033 fishermen get involved in drug trafficking because they can earn more money from illegal activities
377034 lots of my friends have left fishing to get involved in illegal activities such as transporting people or drugs
377035 if you have a big boat you can take up to 60 people at a time and youre guaranteed a profit
377036 we know the sea very well so its obvious theyll look to us to help them
377037 i know there are risks but i think its worth it to take them
377038 we live a hand to mouth existence i live on scraps of change for cigarettes and drinks
377039 fishermen here have no financial power they cant further increase the price of fish because no one will buy it
377040 if you want fast money and are willing to take the risk thats the only way to get it
377041 fishermen face so many problems nowadays so theres a lot we need to do to give them more incentives
377042 me i am here to fish if i have bad months the temptation is there but i try to resist it
377043 high level state authorities are implicated in drug trafficking that is why this commission has been created
377044 i will not turn my back on this fight i will not relinquish my responsibility
377045 drug sniffing dogs had indicated the plane was carrying cocaine but authorities had to wait five days before seizing it
377046 in recent years there has been growing evidence of west africa becoming a favored transit point for cocaine being smuggled to europe with a number of large seizures recorded throughout the region
377047 we applaud the first measures taken by the government such as the seizure of the planes and the detention of some persons and encourage the authorities to handle this issue properly
377048 i would like to stress that the un is monitoring very carefully this case and supports guinea bissau in this new battle against drug trafficking and impunity
377049 from its side the international community should enhance support for national and regional efforts to combat this scourge as stated by the security council
377050 to strengthen its international and regional cooperation to sustain the fight against narcotics trade and organised crime
377051 the acute threat posed by drug trafficking and organized crime to the peace consolidation process
377052 we are facing a total obstruction with death threats to try and stop the investigation from going forward
377053 there are some people among high ranking figures in politics the army and the security forces who do not want this investigation to be held
377054 dey have the same eyes mummy so dey have to live together people who have the same eyes go together
377055 they do have the same eyes babe but its ok to have different ones too i have blue eyes and and daddy has brown but we still live together dont we
377056 no you live with e and daddy lives with me

377059 abc news claim which they said came at first from
377060 its extremely possible one could say highly likely that the same people responsible for perpetrating the attacks were the ones who fed the false reports to the public through abc news that saddam was behind them what we know for certain as a result of the letters accompanying the anthrax is that whoever perpetrated the attacks wanted the public to believe they were sent by foreign muslims feeding claims to abc news designed to link saddam to those attacks would for obvious reasons promote the goal of the anthrax attacker s
377061 see this important point from atrios about richard cohens admission that he was told before the anthrax attacks happened by a
377062 now that we know that the us govt believes that anthrax came from the inside shouldnt cohen be a wee bit curious about what this warning was based on
377063 abc news is deleting any mention of my piece today in the comment section to their article on the ivins suicide
377064 the iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade
377065 ivins local paper frederick news in maryland has printed several letters to the editor written by ivins over the years though the underlying ideology is a bit difficult to discern he seems clearly driven by a belief in the need for christian doctrine to govern our laws and political institutions with a particular interest in catholic dogma

377067 the expansion of outdoor dining and sidewalk cafes is one of the community development departments goals
377068 it gives an interesting vibrant atmosphere to downtown one thats pedestrian friendly and gives us a great sense of place
377069 ninety five percent of our customers want to sit out on the patio
377070 we couldnt have done what we did had that great run without them thats for sure
377071 i know all of us feel blessed to go in but to go in with those two young men that i had a chance to work with and who probably had some play in continuing my coaching career is the topping on all of it
377072 from what im understanding i think im officially the second fastest guy in the family and theres only two of us in here
377073 i felt we probably hurt art some because we played him inside and he even blocked for us in there
377074 it probably cost him some yards on average per catch
377075 you know he coached art first before he transferred over to defense and coached me now you talk about something interesting
377076 what he brought to me was an appreciation and a knowledge of what i was doing and not to begin to try and adjust that but saying youre doing it youre doing what you need to do because i know what it takes at that position
377077 i put myself in a bad situation and i did not handle it the right way
377078 i was wrong and made a mistake my girlfriend my attorney and i wanted a quick resolution and knew that a suspension could happen
377079 based on the nfls personalconduct policy and fabians agreement with the authorities we knew that a suspension was a possibility
377080 did i get hurt last year thats how far it is behind me
377081 im not even looking at 10 minutes ago if you look back you wind up missing whats in front of you
377082 he blew away the conditioning test six straight 150 yard shuttles with ease the last 25 yards he kind of backpedaled
377083 its a tremendous help for us having him back we really need that inside presence
377084 the stuff i did this past offseason was on the verge of suicide at times
377085 like swimming with 50 pounds of weights on your back i almost drowned in 5feet of water but the things i do to keep in shape allow me to come out here and run around kind of crazy
377086 its amazing all the years hes played and yet hes a little kid or a young man mentalitywise and what shape hes in
377087 ive always been a finesse player and im a big guy
377088 so if youve always been a finesse player when you jolt somebody it shocks the hell out of them now i can strike somebody as hard as anybody else
377089 hes 10 years older than haloti ngata hes got some experiences playing that these guys remember watching when they were kids he treats the young guys really well
377090 hes a pretty good natured person during games now he gets serious about what hes doing but outside the lines hell laugh and play with the best of them
377091 its just staying focused and working hard and opening everybody elses eyes so they see what i see
377092 i know what im capable of and how hard i work
377093 i know im able to compete with these guys and one day be a starter
377094 younger guys in my situation have to be prepared when you get the opportunity
377095 theres an issue weve had this happen three or four times at camp with the new drug testing policy thats in place its very strict very stringent and they have to get the drug test done before they can come out and practice in the morning
377096 sometimes it takes guys a little longer to get it done troy took awhile to get that taken care of
377097 anytime youre sitting at home and someone signs you off the street to participate in camp its always an opportunity
377098 it looked like everything was pushing that way toward the playoffs we were getting a little bit better everybody was starting to get used to each other the pieces we plugged in were working and then all of a sudden they make that trade
377099 i didnt see it in sign up for our breaking sports alerts and weekly e newsletter
377100 ah i love the smell of methane in the morning
377101 bout the time the farmer got the old mare to work without eatin she died
377102 go out into the world to find their subject matter
377103 if only there was an expression for something really big bestriding something else that would be just the ticket to talk about our colossus it would really make the city a selling point
377104 ill tell the board but dont make any travel plans
377105 if you begin to understand what you are without trying to change it then what you are undergoes a transformation
377106 it wasnt like him he was really touched and humbled that someone took the time to write a song about him
377107 what difference does it make whether its my friend or someone elses

377109 you can stay on the gas and flip through the gears with no hesitation
377110 the shifting is mind blowing i mean you just touch the button and it shifts
377111 as i recall in 2004 we had a much larger battery that went dead on me several times during long rides
377112 it couldnt last more than three or four hours between charges and the battery pack and control system weighed nearly a pound
377113 it just jams the chain into the big ring no matter how much load is on it
377114 you dont lose any momentum and your legs never stall
377115 what about all my clothes i cant even imagine moving all of this stuff
377116 just leave it here its only like a fifteen minute walk over to where donovan and those guys are living i mean this whole house can be our personal closet if we want we can take our time moving it
377117 doesnt it creep you out to be here at night all these empty halls and rooms just outside of your door
377118 i try to avoid the third floor too actually i only go up there if i absolutely have to
377119 were moving if you want to come help us were trying to get this one house near donovans place
377120 the ones with all the orange doors has it been tapped yet
377121 i dont think so we could hit that up on our way maybe get some stuff for the new place
377122 yeah there could be anything in those storage spaces little capsules of peoples entire lives
377123 tho i very seldom think of him nevertheless sometimes a mannequins blue summer dress can make the window like a dream ah but now that dream belongs to someone else
377124 in the warm new york 4 oclock light we are drifting back and forth between each other like a tree breathing through its spectacles
377125 dont let them control your life we should all do things because we love each other we love you you know do you love us
377126 lets get out of here tom whispered down my ear quickly

377132 my name is ali jaafar and i live in minneapolis i have been a reader of the site for about a year now but i have yet to comment i guess this makes me a lurker but i dont like that word because it reminds of this crappy fake derleth lovecraft book i mostly write editorials for a local alternative magazine i started writing sort of short sort of fiction recently to see what would happen this is what happened
377133 gimmie the twenties dont just give me the fives you fucking cunt
377134 great acting natalie jason jonathon i forgot about jonathon who smiled at me as he sat down a few seats behind me

377137 look you lost me but look where im at now
377138 these finlanders sweat everyday maybe the boy wont see her
377139 what if billy i stab you and leave you for the coyotes
377140 im just saying is all gary is acting like itll be no problem getting him to the sweat lodge out there at the pow wow but he has to come by his own accord aint that the way it has to work
377141 those coyotes wont wait for your death rattle to start feedin neither that i know for a fact
377142 and be sure to record the results as they occur
377143 a man standing not too far from me was knelt down near a boy almost as tall as me
377144 to be honest im kinda glad the body count dropped
377145 and guys try to bring them back in one piece ok
377146 we need to talk about tear gas cause they will use it first obviously avoid inhaling it and do not rub your eyes when you get hurt because that only makes it worse wash your eyes with water guys covering your nose and mouth with your t shirts also helps dont try to pick up the tear gas canisters because theyre really hot kick them away instead and another really important thing do not use water based sunblock cause the tear gas sticks to it and your skin gets burned really badly
377147 they cant deport you if they dont know who you are
377148 i got arrested once and im not telling them a fucking thing right and the interrogator goes i know who you are i think oh fuck and then he says your name is paperwork first name lots of and he lets me go
377149 hey all this is pale stian coming to you from deep inside the occupied territories the weekend is coming up and while you and i go out clubbing the people of ilin also go out protesting confronting the occupying force with what little they have the controversial security fence is being built right through the middle of this village the israelis say the fence is needed to stop terrorists from killing jews while the palestinians say the fence is a land grab personally i dont know who to believe but one thing is for sure today is friday are we talking about much land here no is it an especially nice or arable piece of real estate not really but by god its all these have and theyre not gonna give it up without a song
377150 look what you did look what you did look what you did
377151 we are carrzyink no weapons we shows ouer haandz anz i say to my fellow jew brothzer we are not attacking you zis is agaaainst the occupaaaazion
377152 you wanna throw me in the back as well you fucking fascist
377153 get the fuck out of here before i kill you
377154 let me hit that or ill blow your brains out
377155 well i dont think rogers saying that theres anything wrong with looking like that i think his point is just that thats all there is around here and theres not much space for people who dont fit that mold
377156 well people should be able to dress how they want
377157 well and you have to admit that theres a race factor involved here too michael
377158 why are you next to that kids bed why is your face contorting like that
377159 i seen it myself at times thats me up there right now
377160 i had a little bird used to smell me things at 444 in the black
377161 hey what are you doing in there in that little little room youre bigger than you can see yourself
377162 guitar hero is a really funny craze kind of like the hula hoop
377163 it also is one big reason why so many really young kids are showing up at heart concerts these days
377164 we usually shoot for the same vibe and pick players and vocalists that will work with the song
377165 we dont over think it we just have them play the song as they hear it or sing the tune with their own voice in terms of the arrangements we often make changes to the guitar and bass parts in order to make gameplay more interesting in
377166 theres at least a half dozen other bands waiting in the wings to see what happens with this case
377167 what they did was file for a preliminary injunction over the thanksgiving holiday trying to disrupt sales of guitar hero on a theory that just doesnt hold water
377168 in some cases its karaoke except with the original band members
377169 other times theyll go back to the original to get the vibe but go for something new with aerosmith the vocals and guitar and every sound is different we didnt go for retro we wanted it different for
377170 we had re recorded the song a couple years earlier because we did a commercial for napa auto parts but we couldnt close the deal at the time and so we had a great multitrack of the song sitting on the shelf guitar hero needed it we were ready
377171 we know that if we can increase the process we know what the consequence could be in the brain which would be to increase short term learning and memory
377172 new experiences new memories and new learning are greatly facilitated by neurogenesis
377173 neurogenesis is in fact a fundamental feature of learning and memory neurogenesis goes down with age and its known that with old age theres
377174 the other allele gene copy is normal but it is susceptible to knockout upon ingestion of the orally active estrogen antagonist
377175 they see a very subtle effect in the water maze
377176 now did i put sugar into my coffee already or not
377177 short term memory loss could have an alternative and or additional cause besides defects on the cellular level with my observation i wanted to illustrate that changes on the receptor level may have an effect as well
377178 after going to meetings for a couple of years i got busy no big deal my life got bigger and fuller and i started missing a meeting here a meeting there
377179 we go through the annoying stuff so you dont have to
377180 when everything came down to it this was the situation that was all around the best for lou
377181 not just financially he enjoys the city he enjoys 76ers coach mo cheeks he enjoys his teammates
377182 you go with the flow but you knew they had to spend money on a free agent before they could move on to louis and andre igoudala
377183 we were patient with them we let them go through the elton brand situation they were patient with us as we went out and did our due diligence in finding louis fair market value
377184 this is a tax that will go through every household and every small business in australia
377185 in plain language for real australians trying to feed clothe and house children and raise families and run small businesses and survive as pensioners and carers the emission trading scheme is a tax tax
377186 mr rudd has a responsibility to describe how compensation is going to work
377187 plague pestilence and disease famine death drought and bleaching of the great barrier reef
377188 mr rudd is wanting australia to believe that if australia does not act then that will be the outcome
377189 the truth is if the world does not act and the science is right then that will be the scenario
377190 i have dealt my whole life with fires but i have never seen a sight like this i can safely say that we are experiencing a catastrophe
377191 our only consolation is that there has been no loss of life the weather conditions are very poor
377192 my house was burned down but i saved my children and my husband who is sick with parkinsons disease
377193 i bought this record thinking it would sound like a snotty inside joke but was pleasantly surprised
377194 my governments view on daylight saving is absolutely crystal clear and one of the first things i announced when i became premier
377195 we undertook a major survey and have made all of the results available
377196 it is not a popular decision and has not been easy for some people but i have a very strong view that the shape and nature of our state is one where daylight saving simply wont work
377197 its up to the proponents of daylight saving to convince governments otherwise but they havent been able to do it
377198 for the life of me i just cant understand why the state government insists on ignoring daylight saving
377199 i am aware that it would affect farmers up north but that doesnt compare to how people are adversely affected down here
377200 now it came about when men began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were born to them that the sons of god saw that the daughters of men were beautiful and they took wives for themselves whomever they chose then the lord said my spirit shall not strive with man forever because he also is flesh nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years the nephilim were on the earth in those days and also afterward when the sons of god came in to the daughters of men and they bore children to them those were the mighty men who were of old men of renown
377201 cast out devils dh 2nd record when conceiving this part sometimes cut paste between song sections works well and this song screamed for it in my opinion
377202 nary a peep is heard about the principles involved in political interference because no one dares question the man premier danny williams who can leap tall icebergs
377203 we need to be able to preserve the autonomy of the university
377204 we need some clarity around what role the board has to play what role the university senate has to play and what role the government has to play in the appointment of the president this is bigger than one person

377315 pe acest subiect nu am de facut niciun comentariu insa ce va pot spune este ca jucatorul a parasit romania si s a intors la clubul sau
377316 realist vorbind in meciul de la urziceni putem castiga trei puncte dar la fel de bine le si putem pierde pregatirea jocului s a facut in functie de adversar echipa va trebui sa se inchida in faza de aparare sa nu lase spatii celor de la urziceni de asemenea va trebui sa gasim culoare catre poarta urziceniului deoarece ei au o faza de aparare aglomerata cu densitate mare in ultimii 40 de metri
377317 unirea urziceni are jucatori care pot face diferenta cum ar fi mara apostol paduretu onofras urziceniul e o echipa foarte buna atat pe teren propriu cat si in deplasare am vazut jocul lor de la brasov un joc bun in care s au inchis foarte bine au contraatacat surprinzator indeosebi prin danalache

377320 fata de meciul cu cfr cluj cand ne au lipsit cinci jucatori sambata ne va fi mai usor pentru ca avem de unde alege dar tot nu o sa fim la suta la suta din potential sper sa fie mai bine pentru ca e o concurenta mai mare s a vazut si la meciul cu cfr ca otopeni joaca fotbal indiferent de rezultatele cu care am pierde nu o sa ne fie frica de nicio echipa speram sa obtinem rezultate cat mai bune eu nu sunt adeptul doar al ramanerii in prima liga ci tintesc sus am incsredere ca otopeni nu se va lupta doar pentru mentinerea in prima liga avem un program foarte greu in primele sase etape dar la finalul turului dupa 17 meciuri jucate o sa va schimbati parerea despre otopeni va garantez ca otopeniul nu va retrograda nu ma astept sa fim in fundul clasamentului ci intre primele zece echipe
377321 prefer sa pierd cu 0 4 decat sa joc ca un las si sa pierd cu 0 1 ca nou promovata otopeniul va lasa locul favoritei oricarei alte echipe nu o sa ne aparam ci vom ataca pentru ca nu o sa incercam sa ucidem fotbalul ci vom incerca sa l aducem la un nivel cat mai inalt

377358 rome is keeping its cards close to its chest with regards to the anglican communion but something is going on and the future shape of the church of england may depend on it
377359 in effect orombi is saying we are still part of the anglican communion but canterbury lacks the personal authority to hold together its
377360 the archbishop of canterbury is annoying delegates at lambeth with an over the top display of suffering that seems intended to make him appear
377361 rowan wants to give the impression that attacked from both sides he is offering himself up for sacrifice
377362 if hes got something to say to us he should have come here to say it its a sign of how frustrated the boycotters are that the anglican communion is getting on with its business without them and its a very childish response
377363 rumours abound today that there are actually 666 anglican bishops on site and so the conspiracy theory goes that the organisers are being evasive about the delegates list because they dont want it publicised that the meeting has the same number as the beast mentioned in the book of revelation and beloved of heavy metal bands

377392 risa chan was it would you still like a reading
377393 i dont blame you mysticism doesnt have much of a place in the modern world its all just brushed off as superstitious nonsense now
377394 you should let her try though gaki san shes not a fake
377395 besides its not like its going to cost you anything right yuriko obaasan

377397 i was just joking my dear anyone who takes care of my little eri deserves a free reading should they wish it

377403 i have a clear record of saying that i approve of helping people progress in america
377404 all of us are for affirmative action to try to give assistance to those who need it whether it be african american or other groups of americans that need it
377405 properly structured so that it is not just a quota
377406 take into account class and hardship to assess whether or not a young person is deserving of opportunity
377407 we have to craft it in such a way where some of our children who are advantaged arent getting more favorable treatment than a poor white kid who has struggled more
377408 i support it i do not believe in quotas but i have not seen the details of some of the proposals
377409 mccain also may not be as learned at articulating the nuances

377590 de wegwerptelefoon is de perfecte lagekostenoplossing voor iedereen die wel eens een gsm nodig heeft maar geen verplichtingen wil
377591 anderen willen gewoon een eenvoudig telefoontje doen en hebben al die toeters en bellen van een hip toestel niet nodig
377592 niemand koopt voor 20 dollar een nieuwe gsm we zullen er miljoenen van verkopen
377593 in tal van landen is het zo dat je met je gsm operator een contract van een jaar hebt dat vastzit aan een bepaald toestel als die verbintenis afloopt krijg je weer een nieuwe telefoon de eerste keer geef je je vorige mobieltje nog aan een familielid maar na een paar jaar gooi je zon ding gewoon weg er zijn landen die daardoor met een gigantische afvalberg zitten met de wegwerp gsm ga je nog een stap verder
377594 zon gsm bevat zware metalen en andere giftige stoffen die beter niet in het milieu terechtkomen

377607 de extra mestproductie ten gevolge van de vergunningen betekent een toename van de nitraatproductie met 2 8 miljoen kilo of een stijging met 1 8 procent de fosfaatproductie zou toenemen met 1 4 miljoen kilo of een stijging van 2 3 procent

377655 i have to say this is a question of life and death if mr holbrooke still wants my death and regrets there is no capital punishment i am wondering if his arm is long enough to reach me even here
377656 the current food crisis which is true in many many countries and the poorer you are the more affected you are by that is affecting also the fight against aids and we have the paradoxical situation that some people have access to pretty expensive and sophisticated drugs but have no food to eat nothing to eat or dont have the money to take the bus to go to the medical center and have no job
377657 through this analysis we also hope to be able to answer a question that goes beyond just finding water ice but is this a habitable zone on mars habitable zone meaning that we have periodic liquid water not today but over time and we have the materials that are the basic ingredients for lifeforms it will be for a future mission to find if anybodys home in this environment

377664 chemicals clearly labeled for research and development use only one of which has been designated an investigational new drug
377665 kentucky department of state currently indicates that cti science is currently an active corporation in bad standing
377666 physicians can use the test as part of an early intervention
377667 when patients are confronted with test results they may be more likely to change their behavior
377668 physicians can show patients the test results to help convince them that their drinking is causing serious damage to their organs and other biologic systems
377669 the effect size for dimebon is the largest ever seen over placebo in a trial of an alzheimers treatment
377670 and over one year when placebo patients had declined our patients were kept at or even above baseline on every parameter tested including memory cognitive function and behavior
377671 they say people improve over time on dimebon and that it has a bigger impact on alzheimers disease than weve seen before but the data dont bear out much enthusiasm for that
377672 however what is exciting is that this drug has a different mechanism of action than other
377673 dimebon does appear to preserve function at an improved state for quite a long time
377674 but it is not clear this is anything more than a symptomatic drug and if it doesnt modify the disease it will eventually wear off
377675 in our trial we saw fewer adverse events in dimebon patients than in control patients so we are not only seeing beneficial effects but the drug is better tolerated than placebo that is a very attractive profile for patients
377676 this is an unprecedented result in the treatment of alzheimers disease
377677 we have demonstrated for the first time that it may be possible to arrest the progression of this disease by targeting the tangles which are highly correlated with the disease
377678 i think it may very well be that we will one day have a cocktail of anti amyloid and anti tau drugs to offer patients
377679 these results indicate pbt2 is having an impact on the underlying biology of alzheimers which is very exciting
377680 this is a critical proof of concept and the safety and efficacy demonstrated by pbt2 in this study warrant evaluation in a larger scale clinical trial
377681 these findings give a great deal of hope for individuals with schizophrenia and their families and loved ones and caregivers that were moving towards an understanding of the causes of the disease
377682 weve only explained a tiny fraction of why people might develop schizophrenia and much more work needs to be done to connect specific changes to the full spectrum of other types of genetic factors that might influence schizophrenia as well as ways they might interact with the environment
377683 weve been working on schizophrenia for rather more years than we care to think and successes have not been dramatic
377684 there has been precious little on diseases of the brain and what seems to be emerging is that a lot of risk of brain diseases including schizophrenia and
377685 we looked at a relatively rare type of dna change where people have a substantial portion of a chromosome either missing or extra these are called copy number changes
377686 that triples the number of specific dna areas that may be responsible for schizophrenia
377687 all of these together were found in about 1 percent of patients
377688 in addition to rare variants we were able to convincingly show that common variants are involved in schizophrenia but we dont know how much of a role they play compared with rare variants
377689 it means that virtually all of us have genes for schizophrenia but probably those of us who dont have schizophrenia dont have enough of the genes or possibly have not been exposed to an environmental stimulus
377690 schizophrenia is the ultimate human disease affecting the things that characterize us as individuals
377691 perhaps with a little bit of luck we will gain insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and will discover enough of the variants to put together meaningful diagnostic instruments for this very difficult disease
377692 if youre at risk of alzheimers because your mother had the disease you need to make sure that you take special care of your health
377693 if you had a baseline brain scan and then a follow up five years later and it showed that your glucose utilization was falling off rapidly and in a pattern consistent with alzheimers disease that would be of concern
377694 its certainly plausible that if one inherits faulty mitochondria that might put you at increased risk for alzheimers
377695 it may be that decreased glucose utilization doesnt necessarily mean youre going to get alzheimers disease but that in conjunction with the wrong type of environment or some other genes that might give you a slight risk would combine to give it to you
377696 but in a lot of people it probably is just another insult another hit in a biological boxing match
377697 those things are all good for you anyway and until we have a pill that we can recommend for people those are the sorts of recommendations that were able to offer
377698 there could be a paternal transmission factor but we dont really know what it is
377699 there will be risk factors throughout the genome and some may be paternally transmitted i think it would be too soon to exclude that
377700 the exciting part of this study is that we have discovered a completely new process that regulates the adverse responses to bad memories
377701 these findings can help the development of new drugs to treat conditions in which people are haunted by persistent fears such as or other panic disorders
377702 thats a big effect for a relatively small number of cells
377703 this study shows its possible for fibrocytes to form the premetastatic niche but it stops short of proving they positively are the cells
377704 in addition the prevalence of hiv infection and potential risk factors differed by gender but a finding we didnt anticipate is that living in tijuana for longer periods was associated with lower hiv prevalence in men which is the opposite of what we found in women among women longer term residents in tijuana actually had a higher risk of hiv infection
377705 with disintegrating family support networks sudden changes in a persons cultural environment homelessness and poverty were more apt to see risk behaviors such as unprotected sex with sex workers other men or sharing injection needles among male migrants
377706 however an alternate explanation could be that deportation from the united states leads to social upheaval loss of social ties and income factors which lead to engaging in high risk behaviors
377707 the continued association of diabetes with a number of birth defects highlights the importance of increasing the number of women who receive the best possible preconception care especially for those diagnosed with diabetes
377708 early and effective management of diabetes for pregnant women is critical in helping to not only prevent birth defects but also to reduce the risk for other health complications for them and their children
377709 the mesh is grown in a bioreactor with human dermal fibroblast cells

377711 we were able to prevent the negative functioning and the negative remodeling
377712 in our patients the application of the patch was not associated with any complications the application of the patch is quite simple four stitches are enough to attach the patch
377713 we are in the follow up phase we expect complete follow up results this year
377714 one wonders if the association is the other way around
377715 cognitive and intellectual stimulation has been reported to be protective against dementia in general
377716 living in a couple means that you are confronted with other ideas perspectives and needs you have to compromise make decisions and solve problems together with someone else which is more complicated and challenging it is probably easier to get stuck in your own habits and routines if you live by yourself
377717 one possible explanation could be that some forms of rumination may be associated with effective problem solving and are a form of cognitive activity
377718 cognitive activity has been demonstrated to be associated with decreased risk for dementia
377719 we have to remember that the model is not the disease
377720 if you want to maintain a constant level of inhibition with more neurosteroids you need fewer receptors
377721 after pregnancy when hormone levels drop off you need more receptors to maintain that level if you cannot maintain that level after pregnancy thats when the disorders manifest
377722 we dont know if this is the same mechanism in humans but i think all indications are there
377723 the women that are affected by the disorder the hormone levels are not changed they are not different than in unaffected women so we are confident that it must be the receptor trafficking mechanism that is affected because the changes in hormone levels are pretty normal
377724 this is probably the strongest animal model i have seen in a long time
377725 akba has anti inflammatory properties and we have shown that b serrata enriched with akba can be an effective treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee
377726 the high incidence of adverse effects associated with currently available medications has created great interest in the search for an effective and safe alternative treatment
377727 this is about the third time i remember it coming around
377728 epa confirms that granite countertops pose no significant health risk undercutting junk science fear mongering
377729 i will not comment on anything that they are saying
377730 all i will say is that our position is on the web site
377731 some granite used for countertops may contribute variably to indoor radon levels
377732 at this time however epa does not believe sufficient data exist to conclude that the types of granite commonly used in countertops are significantly increasing indoor radon levels
377733 are the levels of radon in granite dangerous to humans or animals
377734 while radon levels attributable to granite are not typically high there are simply too many variables to generalize about the potential health risks inside a particular home that has granite countertops
377735 the biggest source of radiation within the home is indeed radon
377736 but it is not radon from countertops its radon from the ground
377737 you cant get a mortgage in new jersey without having a radon test
377738 if radon is above a certain level you have to take action
377739 even a countertop that is ten or a hundred times higher than average is going to constitute a minimal contribution of radon
377740 granite has gotten so popular so quickly that it is now coming from all over the world
377741 it would come as no surprise that granite that comes from areas with uranium mines close by might pose a problem but the testing hasnt been done
377742 our studies have consistently shown that granite poses no heath risk
377743 right now it is impossible to understand the scope of the problem or even if there is a problem
377744 the industry says there is no danger but how can they make that leap of faith when granite is coming from all over the world and only a small percentage has been tested
377745 the home kits test for radon not other radiation but if the findings are negative you can assume you dont have a radiation problem
377746 if the results come back positive you should probably have the house tested professionally

377749 this gene by itself does not appear to increase the risk for overall and for specific cardiovascular disease but rather this research suggests a possible connection between the gene variant and migraine with aura
377750 doctors should try to reduce heart disease risk factors and advise young women who experience migraine with aura not to smoke and to consider pill alternatives
377751 while it is too early to start testing young women with migraine with aura for this gene variant more focused research will help us to understand these complex links and will help us to potentially develop preventative strategies
377752 recent studies including some from our group showed that tissue damage is due at least partially to the reopening of occluded arteries
377753 this was new because it was believed for a long time by doctors that all the damage was due to ischemia blockage not reperfusion
377754 research showed that the mitochondrial permeability transition pore is a very important structure involved in cell death after heart attack
377755 people are going to do it when you are rushed to the hospital
377756 you are in danger while they are reperfusing the muscle
377757 after a period of ischemia when certain pores in the mitochondria open that is detrimental
377758 a very small concept study this area has not yet been well investigated
377759 in this study by acting on the target we were able to prevent cell death
377760 now we need more studies to see whether that translates into improvement of left ventricular function and overall heart function

377777 friday is a big day and its especially busy for craft travelling from morans on the weir to the races
377778 we expect that the large amount of helicopter movements today will help the figures for the week balance out and it will be comparable with the traffic last year
377779 we have 87 helicopters registered this week compared with 93 last year so its very similar
377780 we would have broken all records on thursday if it wasnt for the rain
377781 the last three races were a complete wash out and i think you can put a lot of the losses around the ring down to that we were flying until the rain came and were actually up this week on last year so were delighted
377782 we got hit really hard in the galway plate that cost us over a million
377783 they had the good grace not to go with us and instead cleaned out a local bookmaker

377793 we played byu at sc his junior year and he had a great junior season was all over the field beat us on a deep ball the only deep ball we gave up all year was him he does make a lot of down the field plays and hes great to have around hes been here the whole offseason working really hard

377805 todays agreement represents a major step forward to opening civil nuclear cooperation with india while strengthening the worlds nonproliferation regime
377806 we believe this is important not only for us and our bilateral relationship with india but for the rest of the world
377807 this is an important day for india and for our civil nuclear initiative for the resumption of indias cooperation with our friends abroad
377808 we all cross bridges and im not talking about metaphors
377809 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
377810 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
377811 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
377812 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
377813 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
377814 the best equal opportunity employer in the country is the u s military
377815 the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history

377819 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honor the commitments made to the international community
377820 we have been blocked since 2003 the fact that our web site is unblocked is very good news
377821 i do not know how long the arm of mr holbrooke is or whether that arm can reach me here
377822 hes one of the greatest mass murderers of the world and hes putting this out in order to defend himself
377823 its an invented story and no one ought to believe it
377824 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
377825 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
377826 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing
377827 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
377828 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
377829 this was the moment when the rise in the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
377830 spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
377831 i dont think our campaign isnt negative in the slightest
377832 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it well continue to fight and scrap all the way to november 4
377833 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
377834 sanctions imposed on iran for its nuclear program are of a political nature and should be promptly removed
377835 strong positive signal that the only way is negotiation and dialogue
377836 these are good results and we feel were on track to reach the 12 000 goal
377837 its mentioned in the plea agreement by the ausa that no further money laundering charges will be brought against defendant from jan 1999 to april 2002
377838 there are forest product companies in our province that are interested in looking at the feasibility of green power production in nova scotia
377839 the renewable resources expertise and technologies are there its just a matter of putting them together
377840 you north americans get laid off from your job and you immediately think where can i get my next job
377841 in his country and most places around the world he said people think instead
377842 if you knew you could not fail what kind of company would you launch right now
377843 we will have a revenue sharing agreement and irving oil will continue to supply all fuel products to the sites
377844 we are always looking for different ways to add value to the sites these particular locations that weve partnered on with canadian tire present a good business opportunity because they are very close to canadian tire stores
377845 we just feel they allow us to grow our business and also focus on other either retail locations or even other parts of our business like the wholesale side where we actually supply gas stations
377846 the environment in the u s and for u s carriers continues to be challenging impacting in particular our orders and revenues
377847 the most encouraging thing is she has been listened to
377848 i think theres a recognition she has a lot of supporters out there and they need to reach out as shes reaching out to him obama
377849 weve worked together and there are a number of clinton supporters on the platform committee itself
377850 youre doing it for the wrong reason anybody whos in it ought to be in it for whats best for the country you ought to believe in the democratic process the democratic process chose sen obama and i think it was a good choice
377851 what i said in front of a 98 percent conservative rural white audience in missouri is nothing that i havent said before
377852 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
377853 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
377854 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
377855 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
377856 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
377857 you needed that job but they had to give it to a minority
377858 the hands that once picked cotton can now pick a president
377859 there is some room for optimism on the corporate profit front

377866 senate passage of this compact will help us protect the great lakes from water diversions and preserve this invaluable resource for future generations
377867 by passing and enacting the great lakes compact and keeping control of the lakes in the hands of the states that surround them and value them the most
377868 will protect the health of these precious bodies of freshwater preventing unnecessary and dangerous diversions of great lakes waters i know the people of wisconsin feel strongly about the importance of preserving the lakes for future generations
377869 would preserve and protect one of our national treasures for us and future generations
377870 its time to seal the deal and protect our lakes our drinking water our economy and our way of life
377871 we believe the employee free choice act is a bad bill and we have been on the record as opposed to it
377872 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression they are wrong and acting without approval
377873 half of our political action committee contributions are to members of each party
377874 we regularly educate our associates on issues which impact our company and this is an example of that
377875 truthfully i probably wont purchase items that go up that much especially something like christmas decorations
377876 another factor that undermines consumer purchasing power and will hurt spending even more
377877 we put in a garden ive been hard at work digging and planting and its really helping my sanity ive wanted a garden for several years but the trampoline had to go and the entire yard made over before we could do it
377878 i have six raised beds and ive planted tomatoes peppers squash cantaloupe lemon cucumbers carrots onions radishes sunflowers strawberries and herbs its all fenced off from the dog tucker is such a yard destroyer
377879 but i know the first year will be a learning one so well just do our best and see how it goes
377880 we are certain that when used in compliance with standards these fragrance ingredients are safe and can be used with confidence
377881 my first thought was my pregnant daughter was coming for the weekend
377882 the health risk to me and my family was probably small
377883 but ive seen a few that might heat up your cheerios a little
377884 weve been hearing from people all over the country concerned about high readings
377885 i dont really know what the numbers are telling me about my risk
377886 i dont want to tear it out but i dont want cancer either
377887 there is no known safe level of radon or radiation
377888 it makes sense if you can choose another counter that doesnt elevate your risk however slightly why wouldnt you
377889 we want to reassure the public that their granite countertops are safe
377890 we know the vast majority of granites are safe but there are some new exotic varieties coming in now that weve never seen before and we need to use sound science to evaluate them
377891 i think it will be like the mold litigation a few years back where some cases were legitimate and a whole lot were not
377892 a dealer in p e i had eight now wants 50
377893 the only reason we survived is that every other company in canada folded

377896 my compliments on a superb and extremely helpful web site to the best of my knowledge its only one of its kind that provides so much detailed information in one place for the clean air conscious traveler as a business editor for a florida daily newspaper i know quality of life and particularly air quality are critical factors for many high tech companies when they are scouting for locations to expand or start a new enterprise your site and links provide an outstanding portal into this expanding field of clean air consciousness keep up the excellent work
377897 your site is outstanding and very informative i live here in la and have been hoping to one day find an area with cleaner air in particular i had been looking at bellingham and enjoyed reading of your experiences there your writing style is excellent and a real pleasure to read of the many sites out there a truly useful site looking forward to reading about your next journey towards finding a clean air location
377898 i came across your blog and found your site to be a very interesting read thanks for what you do to bring clean healthy air issues to light
377899 your blog on the clean air and your trip to the monterey peninsula is wonderfully written bravo to you on a fine piece of writing and with great photos

377923 a vast area is under a haze of heavy smoke it is estimated that the fire may burn 4 000 hectares of land yet it would not be right to say how many hectares have been consumed by the fire since intense smoke is preventing us from seeing the situation on the ground helicopters are operating somewhat in the dark when dumping water we announced that those in area villages should evacuate their homes

377930 nobody in the history of the world has ever even conceived of making this much less actually made it
377931 we had a letter in our mailbox from the piedmont historical society
377932 they said its a schirmer and dont ever listen to real estate agents
377933 i thought the details were so beautiful and it was so well made
377934 what strikes me about schirmer is his use of curves everywhere especially in the interior spaces in the staircase the double barrel vault ceiling in the foyer curved window frames arched doors the oval stairwell
377935 i cant even count how many french doors there are on this level
377936 it takes the window washer a day and a half to clean all the windows

377945 we used to think of the hamptons as insulated and thats not the case
377946 that number has to come down significantly before things can get better
377947 its not a big enough package to deal with continued foreclosures and the fact that housing prices have not yet bottomed
377948 shop until you drop i know its easier said than done but do it anyway
377949 one of the main ways to save money is to be that person who is really obviously on the ball otherwise ask a lot of questions about the closing costs and maybe every week or so ask about the status of the loan
377950 ask why am i paying a documentation fee and a processing fee why am i paying an application fee and a commitment fee i have heard some places are charging e mailing and pdf fees whats that
377951 one lender may include a document preparation fee that the other doesnt but the second lender has a processing fee
377952 there are some common things you can look for like a 50 courier fee when it only costs 16 to send something through ups
377953 being offered one thing and paying another those last minute settlement surprises

377956 most title companies are amenable to providing credits in these larger transactions you can shop around to get your best deal
377957 the best course of action is to get all of the figures upfront so you are not surprised at closing
377958 we want to focus on what homeowners need to know should they need to renegotiate with their lender or sell their home if they can no longer afford it
377959 there will be no lenders or agents working in those capacities
377960 ideally we hope to arm attendees with information that they can take with them so that they can make the best decision for their situation and then move forward accordingly

377965 has created a scenario where some people who could help distressed homeowners dont necessarily want to do that now

377970 marilyn and i started staging my listings and they sold so fast

377972 people sit on them and that has created some problems we saw one woman sit on one and she got catapulted off

377992 what ensued was a very messy scene where the anesthesiologists could not reintubate the patient and the surgeon could not establish
377993 an indictment albeit at an unfortunate time politically for the hospital on the nursing and respiratory care at sharp grossmont
377994 the patient did have complications post surgery in icu coded and expired
377995 there is no evidence at this time the tube was dislodged and definitely no information regarding lack of observation
377996 i honestly believe this message is coming from an individual who has a history of conflict with our management a man who has intent to harm sharp grossmont publicly
377997 medical record keeping was purposefully watered down to avoid stating what actually happened and to avoid a formal inquiry and autopsy
377998 including minute by minute patient monitoring data in the recovery room during which time mr houtkin

378134 allah is our objective the prophet is our leader the koran is our law jihad is our way dying in the way of allah is our highest hope
378135 when we hear about islamist resistance lets try to put ourselves where they are and try to see it from their point of view
378136 were no longer based on the existence of nation states we must reinvent ourselves
378137 for atheists considered worthy of the death penalty by islamists to team up with their ultimate opponents in attacking canadian civic society demonstrates the fundamental bankruptcy of these two political ideologies
378138 there are more people now saying they dont have answers
378139 this is the new frontier how are people going to eat when theres global warming and when so few will be able to grow food
378140 the issues of justice inequality and poverty are common themes we can work together on they are concerns of conscience
378141 ce rapport pr sente une vision globale dune strat gie internationale pour la politique islamique selon ses lignes directrices et en accord avec elles les politiques islamiques locales sont labor es dans les diff rentes r gions
378142 are asking if anyone was waiting for the no 20 bus that night between the hours of 11 30 p m and 12 30 a m and the bus did not pick them up
378143 the behavior of the paparazzi is out of control it needs to be reined in
378144 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
378145 there are currently on the books sufficient laws rules and regulations
378146 zine doesnt know what the hell he is talking about
378147 without know who is following you you do not know why you are being followed which brings about a very really possibility of suffering harm
378148 the impact of these new officers is felt directly on the front lines
378149 ive always believed that being a municipal police officer is a sacred trust
378150 i think its critically important that we see continued service for our local businesses
378151 bay ferries has worked very hard through the downturn in the tourism industry rising fuel prices and the rising dollar
378152 there was a sense of relief it will be around to 2011 people had lots of praise for all levels of government working co operatively
378153 the government wants to sustain the economic ties that we have built over the years through the ferry service
378154 with this funding we continue to provide a safe and reliable service and maintain important economic and tourism links within our region and within the country
378155 its better than the alternative but in the long run what is needed is stable long term funding
378156 all this is doing is moving the guillotine two years down the road
378157 there is limited air service in the area no rail service and with the higher cost of fuel its better to go by the ferry than to ship all those goods by transport truck around the long way
378158 pre election band aid solution that falls well short of securing the services future
378159 i am concerned about the potential inappropriate use of taxpayers money
378160 a process should be in place to ensure that all current and future board members are aware of all the guidelines that directly relate to them
378161 when expenditures are incurred for which the business purpose may not be self evident a more detailed explanation should be included with the supporting documentation
378162 when we got the audit we did make changes to the travel and expense policy of the board
378163 we made some internal changes for the senior management people mainly surrounding documentation
378164 im not sure id say a corporate culture of frugality is the expression but a corporate culture of accountability
378165 there is clearly a focus on being more efficient and trying to be accountable to the people of canada absolutely
378166 the minister when he took office he made sure crown corporations under his watch would show accountability and taxpayers dollars would be well invested
378167 the conservative government has delivered on its promise to clean up government unlike the past liberal government
378168 the minister takes action and at the end of the day theres a replacement at the helm of this crown corporation
378169 theres no doubt about the importance of having good access to information law that we can rely on
378170 if you learn how to nurse with less resources than you ever felt possible or to be in a clinic where maybe they dont have supplies and they dont have electricity i think it just makes you resourceful and helps you go with the flow
378171 its unfortunate but if id been working for 10 years thatd be a different story
378172 i know that kenya is going to be a far cry from the gambia
378173 the gambia is a small country and has been relatively stable for a number of years and kenya is much bigger and has a lot more going on at this point
378174 the fact that there were two missionaries attacked in a country of 36 million people its the only thing ive heard in the last few months its a very big country theres a lot of people theres a lot going on
378175 my governments view on daylight saving is absolutely crystal clear and one of the first things i announced when i became premier
378176 we undertook a major survey and have made all of the results available
378177 it is not a popular decision and has not been easy for some people but i have a very strong view that the shape and nature of our state is one where daylight saving simply wont work
378178 its up to the proponents of daylight saving to convince governments otherwise but they havent been able to do it
378179 for the life of me i just cant understand why the state government insists on ignoring daylight saving
378180 i am aware that it would affect farmers up north but that doesnt compare to how people are adversely affected down here
378181 i thought it was my baby maybe stuck in the crib but i came out and she was fine
378182 then i looked out the window and i saw some people running around
378183 it wasnt a big fire at the time but within minutes it just escalated
378184 the guy thats next door to the fire victims the back part of his house from the heat and that all his siding is off it didnt burn the wood on his house but his siding is totally gone
378185 i mean there is always a concern about the safety to the community and to the firefighters and emergency personnel who have to respond to these but this one the other night put someones life in jeopardy
378186 this is a celebration of the reopening of a traditional supervised swimming area in historic point pleasant park
378187 it is most unlikely that we will be able to get lugovoi but we can try to make sure that we dont have another litvinenko
378188 send a strong message that this kind of thing will not be tolerated
378189 litvinenko was a former member of the fsb and he became a very unpopular man i assume as a result of that his death was either officially sanctioned or that some faction or other of the fsb tried to get him
378190 if he litvinenko had drunk the whole cup of tea he would have died instantly it is only because he sipped it that he lingered and polonium was detected

378199 i was in school on the friday taare zameen par released i transformed from a nobody to a recognised face in just one day sometimes i feel very strange that all this is happening to me
378200 darsheel is the only genuine child celebrity in india and we are very happy that hes endorsing oyo we feel that his image as a talented child will have a great halo effect on the brand
378201 all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth
378202 go therefore and make disciples of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
378203 teaching them to observe all things that i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even to the end of the age
378204 it was the first time we have done that we have offered rewards before but they have come from private companies or individuals
378205 but we put it up to try to flush him out to see if a member of the vietnamese community would come forward
378206 he didnt want to go back to vietnam because they have the death penalty
378207 but he obviously felt it was a risk worth taking and he bought a one way ticket to go back to vietnam his gang got him id documents
378208 nobody claimed the reward because of fear in the vietnamese community and in the gang
378209 if you give evidence theres a risk to your family back in vietnam thats probably what prevented someone coming forward
378210 this is a bittersweet moment for tobacco growers and their families
378211 i just think its so totally out of character for anything like that to have happened here i just could not believe it was true
378212 these things do happen bizarre things happen everywhere i think the biggest thing is just the feeling of sadness that that happened to someone
378213 you can find whatever you want in town drugs you name it theyre here
378214 any of these guys who say theres nothing wrong with owen sound theyre crazy or they just dont see it
378215 im realistic enough to know that an incident like this is going to give some people pause but i think that for the most part the people in this community will understand that this is absolutely an unusual incident and not the type of thing that happens on a regular basis in owen sound
378216 what would be very upsetting is that these young hooligans will have changed that for the community and theres no way that they should be allowed that kind of power
378217 it feels like theyre literally drilling above the apartment if i take off my shoes i can feel vibrations on my floor
378218 when you feel like your work environment is more of a peace haven than your home environment you know thats a problem
378219 it is with the tribunal now and i will not give you any comments because it is with the lawyer and with the court
378220 if they cant conduct business what does that mean for the rest of us
378221 its forcing me out of my apartment they have no concern for our quality of life
378222 its on par with going to new york to go shopping going to london to see theatre going to africa to do a safari
378223 the stigma that cars are for men is still there i do what i do if they dont like it i dont mind
378224 since the age of 16 my father taught me how to drive stick i taught my daughter
378225 its still great date bait men love women who drive stick shift
378226 hes definitely not the evil person people are making him out to be
378227 i think that judge youngs decision was very well thought out very thorough and i think in the end it was the right decision
378228 ontarians are coming together to more effectively assert themselves in the face of an unfairness caused by the financial arrangements between us and ottawa
378229 my friends it is time to stand up for our province time to stand up for ontario
378230 its becoming more and more urgent and theres a continuing need to speak about it because there hasnt been an appetite at the federal level to really engage in fixing the system
378231 im not a developer and i dont want to be a developer im in the theatre business
378232 i want to create value for my land because it allows me to do theatre it allows me to draw people around me draw them downtown which means more people for my theatres
378233 because there is so much development in the neighbourhood were trying to come up with an idea of how we want the area to look
378234 i have a long relationship with historic conversions the royal alexandra was a historic building and so was the royal vic in london dating back to 1818
378235 its like a kind of 18th century pastoral english village
378236 the demographic is changing as new people move in and old people die or leave
378237 there probably is some tension as a result of that the world changes and people change with it
378238 certainly the rise in property values has seen a shift in the community
378239 whereas it used to be more arts and culture oriented now it is more diverse they the arts and culture types would represent the older part of the community and the newer part would be a variety of people from entrepreneurs to lawyers and so on
378240 ive always had the feeling that theres a very civil relationship and people care for each other as neighbours and feel very citizenly toward the park
378241 we do not ignore the people in the park theres probably more or less intimacy between neighbours
378242 we always joked people were born there then their parents died then they lived in their parents house and then they died thats very stereotypical about a lot of people in the park
378243 back home wed serve it family style with large platters of basmati rice raisins and sweet bananas
378244 you can see the influence of so many cuisines in somali cooking arab indian portuguese
378245 were used to scouting in all sorts of weird and wonderful places but football crowds are a new concept for us
378246 we typically take into account a whole range of aspects from the symmetry of a persons features to the glossiness of their hair
378247 we might need to start scouring the stands at anfield to find our next big name
378248 did you see anything do you know who that was
378249 the flavours complement each other rather than being like a back alley fist fight
378250 shall i scoop you in my arms and take you inside my car where you can dry off and change so that i can then drop you off
378251 so remember when youre feeling very small and insecure how amazingly unlikely is your birth
378252 in the general sense the absolute speed of any object through space is not a meaningful question according to einsteins special theory of relativity which declares that there is no
378253 wir sind intelligent jetzt gehst du auf die eine seite und ich bleibe auf dieser seite dann k nnen sie uns nicht erwischen
378254 it aint braggin mutha fucka if you back it up
378255 ela come p o com ovo o ovo o ovo ela come
378256 the problem is solely theirs and by that i mean its theirs to figure out
378257 a solution is not going to come with anything we do to the track figuring it out will only come with getting the car and tyre combination right and that requires actually spending the time and effort to do something about it
378258 ill tell you this tony george said that they werent changing the track and i dont blame them
378259 its expensive to pave the track but diamond grinding the race track with the grooves does directly have an effect on tyre wear directly and anyone who wants to say otherwise is just in denial all right
378260 so with that said obviously i wouldnt expect him to repave the race track even though they did diamond grind it for no good reason they just paved it i wouldnt pave it either or again
378261 but what were going to have to do and i think that indy is an isolated case its always this time of year that we see this whether we want to go or need to go or whatever were going to have to go down there and put two days of rubber on the race track one or two weeks prior to the race just to fix that issue
378262 i dont think changing the tyre is going to help it
378263 a harder tyre might last 20 laps but it didnt seem like the tyre got better as the race got better the tyre wasnt putting rubber down it was turning to dust and not laying on the race track and not merging with the asphalt
378264 and you cant tell me that those grooves in the race track dont have a direct affect on tyre wear thats crazy
378265 the crew chiefs did vote on where to test and the tracks that they picked to test under the limit of tests they were allowed to have are tracks that we needed to test you know its not like we turned our back on indy and just didnt want to go
378266 we had some other things that were more important other tracks that were more important that correlate with the new car and struggling with it
378267 i honestly dont feel any pressure or anything like that weve gotten ourselves into a few situations that really werent our fault and they have affected the points but you cant let that get to you
378268 we didnt really make a lot of changes or anything like that in practice i took what i remembered in june and applied it today we should be real good in the race tomorrow
378269 ya fu primero el viernes en magny cours y al final las cosas fueron distintas no es normal que estemos tan arriba y por delante de ferrari y otros equipos supongo que habr n rodado con m s gasolina y ma ana habr que luchar mucho si queremos estar en estas posiciones

378272 probablemente no ha sido mi mejor partido comet algunos errores con 6 5 desperdici dos match ball y perdi su servicio por dos dobles faltas y mi movimiento en pista fue regular as que debo mejorarlo si quiero jugar mejor el siguiente partido estoy feliz porque en estos momentos en los que no est s jugando bien lo importante es la victoria por la actual situaci n ha sido un partido importante
378273 bueno desde ahora mismo s que estoy en una buena posici n no porque roger tenga que ganarlo todo desde aqu de los juegos ol mpicos al open usa pienso que si gano el siguiente partido ser n 1 y tambi n lo puedo ser en dos semanas as que no importar si pierdo en primera ronda en los juegos ol mpicos y roger gana el partido importante es el de lapentti

378300 like i care they wish they were getting fucked as good as i am and by such a stud too even though this guy is the janitor ive seen the girls looking at him i know they have secret crushes on him i think i will tell them im fucking him theyll be soo jealous
378301 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
378302 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
378303 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
378304 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
378305 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
378306 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
378307 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
378308 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
378309 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
378310 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

378322 basque people have big balls blowing up all over france and spain
378323 i have a friend who did 18 months in prison for killing a green beret he shot him with a 22 pistol
378324 and if you dont have a permit you can do 10 years in prison for shooting an elk to eat it for your family is that right
378325 the lord says to go out and cut a tree but the government says no
378326 i grew up taking care of the forest to live but the government owns two thirds of the land and now im not allowed to do that so i just recycle everything weve always recycled everything but now i do it to eat
378327 his image and the messages associated with the campaign resonate with me
378328 just the way he emotes provides insight into his character
378329 i think artists are drawn to obama because they are trained to express themselves with color and image obama too is a painter hes painting the future for us splashing color here and creating the image of a beautiful multicultural future
378330 in ray noland you have a guy who essentially packed up his car and is driving city to city showing the work and donating what proceeds he can to the campaign
378331 they are on ebay soon after selling for thousands of dollars
378332 the new yorker cover of obama in muslim garb his wife michelle holding a rifle was auctioning for 20 when you could still get it at newsstands
378333 the rainbow colored paint symbolizes all the diverse cultures and religions that make our country great that have been marginalized by previous leaders
378334 obama when he is elected president will finally be the leader that symbolically adds the last few paint strokes on the top of the capitol building to make it truly represent all americans
378335 we have people visiting galleries in chelsea who otherwise may have never come
378336 americas artists are the guardians of the spirit of questioning of innovation of reaching across the barriers that fence us off from our neighbors from our allies and adversaries from the six billion other people with whom we share this dark and dazzling world
378337 art increases the sense of our common humanity the imagination of the artist is therefore a profoundly moral imagination the easier it is for you to imagine walking in someone elses shoes the more difficult it then becomes to do that person harm
378338 i just want her to enjoy her life and be friends with both of them
378339 if she doesnt choose edward ill be mad but ill be ok with it as long as shes happy
378340 i re read the first three books this past week
378341 theres no real theme i could grab onto not like harry potter
378342 i mean will she get married will she turn 19 we have no idea whats going to happen
378343 that a book can get that amount of children talking about literature because thats really what theyve been doing all night is just amazing people say books are dead but theyre not
378344 here you have a whole generation of children who have these books in common this thing that connects them from a literary standpoint
378345 i could have taken drugs or stayed home and done nothing watched television hung out in taverns or whatever but no i love adventure
378346 i think we have a good chance of getting them
378347 i have proof at home the longest passport in the world
378348 ive been working out all my life look at me im in fairly good shape for a man 84 years old
378349 at first i thought he was crazy doing all that
378350 im not here to make friends im here to win
378351 theres a long tradition of actors who have disdained the hollywood establishment and then had some retribution for it within the hollywood establishment
378352 he didnt live the way a star was supposed to live there was an expectation placed on him and he didnt satisfy that expectation and hollywood took retribution
378353 i did not feel that i was given the material this season to warrant an emmy nomination and in an effort to maintain the integrity of the academy organization i withdrew my name from contention in addition i did not want to potentially take away an opportunity from an actress who was given such materials
378354 first of all she did something crazy and that is she told the truth
378355 at the very least she told her truth and in this town its not always a great idea because what you have to understand is television is a very collaborative industry and what shes essentially done is trash her writers these are people you have to go to work with every day
378356 im going to be really honest right now he needs to just not speak in public period
378357 it supports what we know about katie heigl is that shes kind of an edgy mouthy girl whos a bit of a rabble rouser and as long as shes able to open movies and put butts in seats shes still going to have a career
378358 in this town women who dont just snap and say ok yes sir yes maam start to get a reputation for being difficult
378359 but within the last five years ive decided its not worth it to me to be pushed around so much
378360 with the 24 hour news cycle anything you say thats remotely off the cuff or interesting is going to get repeated and reported on
378361 i think any celebrity now who really speaks his or her mind is going to be raked over the coals for it
378362 in terms of being a role model for other women i think its important that people learn how to speak their mind after they assess the risks and rewards
378363 who is not willing to submit to the hollywood spin machine
378364 i met him once and he was very kind to me i never got a chance to tell him what i thought that he was my hero
378365 i spent five years in a hospital after the war this is one of the secret awards i wanted i was hoping this would happen in my lifetime and it did
378366 they dropped down the age to enlist to 18 i signed my mothers name and she was not happy about that
378367 i never turned down anything and never argued with any producer or director
378368 i got really charmed by it its so colourful and the characters really spoke to me if you know a little about the artists most of them are characters in themselves i started buying a piece here and there
378369 its a heavy hunk of wood painted black and white and i had it on a freestanding shelf in one of my apartments it fell off and hit my roommate on the head i still have that skunk and he hasnt injured anyone since

378371 and were probably the only people under 60 at the concert our first shared interest was folk music
378372 when we first started dating i remember going into her house
378373 i dragged him here to nova scotia for the first time the following summer
378374 i started to develop a bit of a passion of my own
378375 we starting buying pieces together and we have quite a collection at home now
378376 the behaviour of the paparazzi needs to be reined in
378377 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
378378 there are currently on the books sufficient laws rules and regulations
378379 zine doesnt know what the hell he is talking about
378380 without know who is following you you do not know why you are being followed which brings about a very really possibility of suffering harm
378381 we were looking for well roundedness and commitment to the olympic movement but more so commitment to the olympic values excellence leadership respect
378382 both of these individuals have lots of experience in sport but also giving back to their sports and community development
378383 im sure there were a lot of applicants and im glad they chose me so ill try to make the best out of the experience and make canada proud
378384 its every athletes dream just to be at the olympics even though im not going to be competing its still going to be a pretty amazing experience
378385 its amazing because all these athletes have worked so hard to get where they are just watching them compete theyre the best athletes in the world they push the limits of their bodies
378386 if all these other people can get there so can i
378387 i think it will offer inspiration to see everyone else out there who have done amazing things
378388 i personally swim farther distances than they have available right now
378389 im kind of scared i dont know how big it is
378390 i hope i can get back at it but who knows
378391 like i said ive had 80 years of real good eyesight so i shouldnt complain i guess
378392 in the meantime you can at least celebrate his achievements to date
378393 i dont know how many thousand truck doors ive lettered in my life
378394 those things would take id say maybe two days if i kept right at it
378395 i do a painting let it sit for a few days go back and look at it and say gosh ive got to put in this guy or something else would pop into my head
378396 theyre not trying to be heroic theyre just people having fun
378397 theyre bumps and bruises from where you walked off the curb you would have seen if you were watching
378398 weve definitely seen people step out into traffic because they were texting
378399 weve seen people horribly injured because they were playing with their phone while they step off the sidewalk
378400 as cell phones proliferate and texting is becoming more common and popular our concern is the frequency of these injuries will just grow
378401 im not going to constantly text ill stop and look up
378402 ive used it in the car and ill miss an exit
378403 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
378404 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
378405 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
378406 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
378407 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
378408 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
378409 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
378410 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
378411 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
378412 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
378413 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
378414 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen
378415 where its dark its creepier now i mean i dont mind because of course if something did come out at us down here it would be scary but we shouldnt run because its very rare that a ghost will actually harm you
378416 it happens but it doesnt happen a lot i mean theyve been known to throw things at people and that sort of thing
378417 here because i love the man and the man loves ghosts
378418 for some reason when this hymn has been played in the past things happen
378419 the collection plates the big brass ones have seemed to shake not from a tremor just actually by themselves there was an experience where one of the organists was playing it and they watched dean llwyd come out of the vestry
378420 if you are could you please give us some sign of your presence
378421 dean llwyd could you maybe touch one of us so that we know that youre here
378422 im waiting for evidence for myself i dont necessarily believe in ghosts but i dont not believe in them
378423 what we know because we have bodies what are the cultural clues present that help us to interpret the uncle sam poster

378428 my love life is just like helga pats steering wheel big and empty and blue d
378429 i knew you had to have gone to college i guess i didnt make the connection summer you out of school how was school
378430 waves back enthusiastically hi i know right so how was it

378433 they will delight our readers who have followed the growth of the jolie pitt family
378434 i walked away saying there has to be a better way
378435 it occurred to me we should utilize the imaging power of graphic gaming cards
378436 we didnt know what to expect and we stood there on the first night and got our faces blown off
378437 he is such a good entertainer its unbelievable he had everybody going crazy
378438 i watched it from beginning to end to see how he did it and the mans a genius every night by the end of the show he had everybody up into the highest rows of the top bowl swinging their t shirt around their head and screaming
378439 he was such a nice guy the first time i met him he was like call me bobby
378440 each half kind of feeds off the other and its essential for me to do that
378441 the guys in the band know that and theyre cool with it since if im not able to do solo work i wont be inspired to write el torpedo songs
378442 when i was done doing when the angels make contact which was a very intense period i was super excited about getting back with the guys and not working with a 14 piece band playing the weirdest songs ever
378443 ive messed up some relationships and missed a lot of friends and familys birthdays
378444 but everybody understands and has been supportive and just incredible about it basically im sacrificing my whole life for this one thing for my music and my songs
378445 when i was living in halifax i wasnt feeling completely blown open about making music and right around that time my friend mike called from new york with an offer to sublet his apartment he needed an answer right that moment and i wasnt planning on moving there but i realized that this was it this was the phone call that would change everything and now im in the world headquarters for music
378446 we didnt change the way we did things doing all the bed tracks live so its us all playing together but its definitely a different sound with jay on board ive known him for 10 years and it felt really natural right away
378447 i didnt tell him how i wanted him to play we just plugged our guitars in i showed everyone the songs and off we went
378448 ive wanted to drive one for a looong time it was like a dream come true although i barely fit in the thing because im so big but it was awesome
378449 we got quite a few complaints after filming though when we do a video we get a full on stage pa and point it at our faces but it was about four in the morning and apparently some fairly high profile people lived not too far away
378450 i really dont care thats rock and roll right you cant stay up all night in halifax filming a video without getting some complaints
378451 and a small amount of pcp used in the manufacture of speed
378452 this is the highest inflation in three years it was last at 12 6 in april 2005 we are at the peak of the harvesting season for a number of food items but the prices have remained high due to high transport costs and high demand from southern sudan and democratic republic of congo
378453 we have imported inflation from kenya where our imports pass also border charges are incurred by the products thus causing an increase in their prices
378454 uganda kenya and tanzania will face high inflation even if we integrate because our imports sometimes pass through kenya and tanzania while their demand for food from uganda remains high
378455 all the electrical machinery like turbines and generators are on site awaiting installation after completion of the power house
378456 blasting of rocks and diversion of the river to create space for construction of the dam wall is in high gear

378461 he was really calm like a robot just stabbing over and over and the other guy was just screaming horribly
378462 celeste do something about those guys trying to get into our cab
378463 e un joc foarte important iar noi trebuie s avem continuitate la jocurile bune cu rezultate pozitive sper s ob inem primele puncte n liga campionilor nu va fi u or am avut n toate meciurile adversari buni dar m bazez pe faptul c juc torii i au mai revenit fizic i psihic cu o atitudine pozitiv sunt sigur de victorie
378464 sper m ntr un rezultat prin care s i mul umim pe suporteri care atunci c nd vin mul i la stadion contribuie la succesul echipei victoria cu dinamo ne d ncredere i dac vom juca la fel i m ine cum am f cut o cu dinamo sunt sigur c vom nvinge slavia
378465 remiza pe care a reu it o slavia cu arsenal 0 0 le a dat ncredere cehilor dar eu cred c i dac pierdeau cu arsenal ar fi venit la fel de motiva i la bucure ti
378466 este normal dupa un meci cu dinamo sa apara si accidentari trebuie sa str ngem din dinti si sa ncercam sa trecem peste aceste mici probleme medicale si sa ajungem n teren cu jucatorii care sunt valizi suta la suta si care sunt gata sa dea totul pe teren nicolita pentru acest jos este iesit din calcule probabil la el accidentarea este destul de grava necesita cel putin o saptam na de repaus
378467 arresti arbitrari di avversari politici torture di detenuti di avere soffocato la libert di espressione e di raduno e avere violato diritti processuali di attivisti di al fatah
378468 on a scale from one to ten just how gay are you
378469 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
378470 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
378471 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
378472 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
378473 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
378474 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
378475 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
378476 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
378477 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
378478 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
378479 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
378480 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
378481 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
378482 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
378483 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
378484 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
378485 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
378486 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
378487 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
378488 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
378489 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
378490 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
378491 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
378492 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
378493 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
378494 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
378495 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
378496 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
378497 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
378498 who are open to doing something on the production side
378499 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
378500 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
378501 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
378502 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
378503 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
378504 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
378505 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
378506 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
378507 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
378508 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
378509 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
378510 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
378511 the housing sub sector was beginning to encounter problems because of lack of policies and regulations there have been a number of disputes between estate agents and their customers

378517 i look forward to a time when muslim liberalisim triumphs over facisit oppression
378518 in 2005 as a reaction to the israels unilateral disengagement plan a group called
378519 shouldnt we also look forwards to a time where arab liberalism triumphs over islamo fascist oppression and they being to get along with their fellow jews and share the positives of both cultures instead of the negative
378520 safed 1834 during the thirty three days of the riots the jewish community was dwindled and ruined many were beaten to death and fell in the open streets many were severely wounded their eyes blinded men and women were tortured thirteen synagogues the jews had in safed and in them five hundred books of the torah and all were destroyed then the precious books of rabbi isaac abuhab were lost the synagogue of the haari hakadosh the holy lion rabbi isaac lurya and the book of the torah at the synagogue of rabbi shimon bar yochai at meron the homes of the jews were emptied and many were destroyed down to their foundations because the bandits searched them for treasures of gold and silver many houses were burned the printing press of rabbi israel beck which was in those days the only printing press in the entire land of israel with all its publication the five books of the pentateuch and other books were destroyed and burned and rabbi israel beck was bitten many times and he was sick in his legs for the rest of his life most of the jews were left without a robe to cover their skin
378521 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
378522 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
378523 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
378524 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
378525 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
378526 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
378527 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
378528 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
378529 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
378530 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
378531 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
378532 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
378533 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
378534 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
378535 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
378536 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
378537 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
378538 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
378539 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
378540 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
378541 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
378542 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
378543 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
378544 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
378545 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
378546 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
378547 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
378548 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
378549 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
378550 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
378551 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
378552 i read the first line of the book and it just grabbed me
378553 que es el t tulo que le han dado en
378554 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
378555 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
378556 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
378557 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
378558 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
378559 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
378560 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
378561 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
378562 no father i really hope you have a good morning
378563 whats wrong with that arent you doing it right now
378564 mr b its the principal of jennas school i dont mean to alarm you but we are very concerned about your daughters behaviour the past few days
378565 it seems your daughter has become rather serious of late i am worried there is something going on at home that is encouraging this
378566 no not at all i can assure you mrs b and i are certain to be sarcastic with her all the time i have no idea where this could be coming from
378567 i see mr b however i am going to have to ask you to come pick her up and keep her at home her troubling behaviour is upsetting the other children
378568 yes yes of course i understand completely im leaving now and ill be there as soon as possible
378569 i appreciate it mr b sorry to bother you i hope this problem can be resolved soon she is such a promising student
378570 mr b its mr h while youve been playing house life has been going on here at work and the president is wondering if you could grace us with your presence to deal with an awkward situation

378601 the evidence uncovered by the sciences but it was a philosophical inference drawn from the evidence
378602 with the insight of einstein and other noted scientists that there had to be an intelligence behind the integrated complexity of the physical universe the second was my own insight that the integrated complexity of life itself which is far more complex than the physical universe can only be explained in terms of an intelligent source
378603 a person but not the sort of person with whom you can have a talk it is the ultimate being the creator of the universe
378604 i believe that the origin of life and reproduction simply cannot be explained from a biological standpoint despite numerous efforts to do so with every passing year the more that was discovered about the richness and inherent intelligence of life the less it seemed likely that a chemical soup could magically generate the genetic code

378615 theres no doubt that we do this having reflected long and hard and recognizing the deep concerns and frustrations that canada has gone through over the nuclear history with india
378616 but you cant keep somebody in the penalty box forever
378617 the way were looking at it is that our relationship has been underperforming if not in the doldrums completely for a couple of decades now if not more
378618 and indias come a long way in terms of democracy and the rule of law and the whole nuclear constellation of issues has evolved to the point where we just cant continue with our position that has been absolute and negative to allowing india back into the nuclear club as it were
378619 the benefit is not in non proliferation the benefit is in potential markets

378777 whenever weve had people come to us after automobile accidents the most common thing is someone shows up looking for them
378778 when the consulate finally got ahold of someone who they thought was related they said this is not our relative
378779 he is unable to write we dont know if that is part of the injury or if he was never able to write
378780 the method was deliberately chosen to stack the deck against this proposition
378781 when i was searching for my favorite graphic novelists in the world i had this fond memory of prince of persia i hadnt played since pretty much the apple ii days the first prince of persia i was really really blithely unaware of what had happened to prince of persia in the intervening ten or twelve years
378782 when i found out there were all these games and a movie with jerry bruckheimer i thought oh well nice chatting with you mr
378783 may or may not be a member of iranian royalty an actual prince of persia and illustrated by alex puvilland and leuyen pham will be released this fall
378784 the last ubisoft game i was intimately involved in creatively was 2003s sands of time where i was a writer and game designer
378785 when i started making the first prince of persia game in 1985 i was right out of college
378786 i was really focused just on doing a game getting the bugs out of it and being able to ship it at the time the job game designer didnt really exist as we know it today so though what i was doing was designing a game the job i had was programmer that was my skill designing the game programming it and doing the animation were so intertwined
378787 i didnt realize until after the game shipped that what was valuable was not the coding but the design which was something people could take and translate to other platforms
378788 now theres ubisoft making new prince of persia games which i kind of have to look at and say in what way is this even the same character yet theres something in its dna thats still the same
378789 thats like the graphic novel are all these different princes of persia the same character
378790 what is the prince of persia in all these different versions of the story they could all be conflicting if youve played the games and you read the graphic novels youll find things that are almost echoes of the game
378791 its not like i remember this scene its a totally different set of characters a totally different story
378792 im not a fan of the artistic direction or the violence that earned it an m rating
378793 the story character dialog voice acting and visual style were not to my taste
378794 speaking of sound bites i said something once that got quoted a lot of places about warrior within
378795 you know i dont like to criticize a particular game basically what i meant to say was that the style wasnt my style its not what i would have done but id rather just let that be what it is warrior within and two thrones and the new game is a totally different style rather than focus on that id rather focus on the positive and hope the new game is really awesome im glad theyre taking it in a new direction with this game
378796 nothing from warrior within and two thrones is in the movie
378797 adapting a video game script into a movie script is actually based on what needs to be done to write an entirely new story
378798 if it ends up being the same thing its because on a deep level its got the same meaning similar plot elements and characters and the same genre but the way you achieve that has to be totally different
378799 a video game story is not meant to be watch
378800 its not meant to be told to you its meant to be played in sands of time you basically spend the game fighting monsters and being acrobatic its fun to do but its not necessarily fun to watch somebody else doing on screen on a movie you dont necessarily want to just watch somebody doing stunts you want to be taken on an emotional journey the awesome action is awesome only insofar as you care about the characters and what happens to them
378801 this is great for a game it turns the palace into a place where he has to do all this dangerous running and jumping
378802 and everyone he meets is a monster whos trying to kill him which is great because the only way he can interact with them is to kill them but theres no button for talk to someone all these other ways of interacting with people didnt exist in our game you cant interact with anybody you meet except with your sword
378803 for the movie despite the differences with the sands of time video game story its very reminiscent of what the games story is
378804 but you want other characters in a movie not just the one main love story you want things that happen elsewhere in the world not just in rooms in the palace adapting from an interactive medium to a non interactive medium means changes to the story if you want to do it right
378805 the great thing about the myths is that theyre timeless
378806 theres a book called the shahnameh the persian book of kings written down in the eleventh century
378807 its awesome i had read some of the stories but i didnt read the whole book until i was doing research for the sands of time game its a treasure trove
378808 its a lot of mythology and its sort of similar to one thousand and one nights which was one of the other influences on the games and movie
378809 some of the stories from one thousand and one nights came from persia some came from syria some came from china and so on the great thing about the myths is that theyre timeless the idea of retelling the same stories but having them be different is in some ways the same as what were doing in video games the storyline in prince of persia 1 doesnt fit with the story in sands of time or prince of persia 3d it cant be the same prince there are contradictions but it doesnt matter
378810 the last express was a labor of love for me
378811 it was a labor of love for me and the team there are a couple of members of the team here today they coded the elaborate logic that would make it possible for characters to interact around the train it was incredibly expensive at the time it was 5 million dollars thats the kind of budget where you need to sell millions and millions of copies and adventure games just dont
378812 the audience for adventure games is just a lot smaller than the audience for action games
378813 im really fascinated by the potential of that kind of gameplay but not any time soon
378814 in 2002 when ubisoft montreal and i were finding how to bring prince of persia the sands of time to next gen consoles we were looking at prince of persia 3d as an example of what we didnt want to do
378815 at the time a lot of other games that had the basic prince of persia running and jumping mechanic they just werent exciting to us
378816 i think the insight that really got us all excited was that because its a 3d world we could be vertical as well as horizontal
378817 you could be running on walls not just running around the whole game then became about that about creating levels around that and a story around that parkour was an inspiration we were trying to do something that would have the same excitement and impact in 2002 that simple 2d fluid running and jumping had in 1989
378818 its not going to be in the way you expect
378819 for sands of time which is the last prince of persia i played very deeply and my hands know how to play i played it on playstation 2 since that was the lead development platform
378820 now i have an xbox 360 and thats the one i play a lot of different games on

378870 if you uttered decommissioning you would get slaughtered even now
378871 you would lose the leadership i can see no form of decommissioning this side of the general general john de chastelain of the independent international commission on decommissioning going
378872 have made their minds up and are adamant that if there is no form of decommissioning before the general goes then they intend to treat loyalists as criminals
378873 theres no discussion or debate about it in the loyalist community and i think theres probably a lack of understanding from those in the chattering classes who make the demands but have no idea of the processes of delivery nor do they engage in order to help people move forward
378874 engage with people seek to understand where people are at and what things need to happen in order to deliver
378875 but what i do see is a loyalist community under pressure and its not from weapons
378876 if we can identify people they will go for their tea
378877 people will not let them the loyalist paramilitaries continue to play the game they are playing of talking and talking and talking and doing nothing
378878 you are thrown in with the rest of the criminals

378908 since there is no declaration of election postponement international observers speculated that the election will be conducted in due time and in a peaceful manner
378909 when there are people observing what you are doing you are always on your toes especially foreign observers at that it is a reflection of how well we are doing in our elections exercise if we do it correctly we will get a free ride in the media we can learn also from them they can tell us how elections are held in other places theyve observed
378910 insofar as we are concerned there is no postponement we cannot postpone we will go on with the exercise even if its postponed to test the system
378911 from a logistical point of view this is easier for us we did it before in armm
378912 but its different now because the election is automated and the national situation is uncertain these are the complicating factors

378931 hes going to have a positive impact here night in and night out
378932 i dont care about any of the other stuff heres what i know hes one of those guys who just doesnt come along hes on the short list of best right handed hitters of all time
378933 he likes to cut loose yes but he is really focused on his business too they will love manny here
378934 i know the last few weeks have been tough but this is a guy with a reputation as a big time worker my job with a hitter of his caliber is to ask him what his program is and to get to know the way he goes about his business im trying to learn him get to know him im not telling manny ramirez how to hit the ball hes got that covered
378935 hes said to me that he just wants to play baseball now
378936 i understand where hes coming from the stress that goes on it wears on you
378937 there are certain rules we like to adhere to as far as getting here on time and playing the game the right way and thats pretty much all i require he said
378938 i never try to change a players personality i try not to have any preconceived notions if theres something we need to talk about well do that
378939 thats manny being manny to me its nice to see him on my side coming out of my dugout and going to hit against somebody else for a change
378940 through all the fun and games there is always an edge about him hes about as confident in his ability as anyone ive ever seen but its more than that
378941 whatever it is that drives him it drives him it is there all the time no matter how much fun he seems to be having i used to watch him from the opposite dugout and you could see the intensity the desire in his face you watch him when he pops up or strikes out youll see it this guy wants to win more than anything else and he wants to prove himself every time up
378942 shame on us if we put it all on him
378943 hes going to do some things and the energy he brings it really rubs off

379086 his face was not quite round but inclined to roundness
379087 alex meine erste frage ist nicht ganz ernst gemeint sie bezieht sich auf eine aussage von dir die du anl sslich der ersten haifischflosse die bei red bull aufgetaucht ist get tigt hast mussten eure techniker etwas sichtbares entwerfen um ihre hohen geh lter zu rechtfertigen
379088 das war eine ironische bemerkung zum gesamtbild der formel 1 weil wir w hrend der saison immer diese ausw chse an fl gel und leitblechen haben die dann manchmal nichts bringen und dann aber wiederum sehr viel bringen und da geht es manchmal das berrascht mich selbst immer um ein paar millimeter bei irgendwelchen unwichtigen teilen und ein anderes mal kann irgendetwas verbogen darauf herumflattern und es bringt gar nichts das ist irrwitzig eigentlich was hier vor sich geht
379089 und die haifischflosse die ihr bei honda jetzt ebenfalls einsetzt
379090 das ist entstanden weil die seitlichen cockpitst tzen weiter vorgezogen wurden und neben dem helm steiler aufsteigen das erzeugt mehr luftverwirbelungen die sich dann hinter der motorhaube treffen und eigentlich ein bisschen den heckfl gel st ren das war fr her nicht der fall weil der seitliche aufprallschutz f r die piloten flacher gestaltet war und es daher auch keine verwirbelungen hinten gab jetzt versucht man diese verwirbelungen zu beruhigen man schaut dass sich diese luftstr me hinten nicht wieder treffen und noch mehr verwirbelungen ausl sen eben mit dieser langen heckflosse
379091 ihr habt ja bereits mit einer konfiguration f r 2009 getestet mit keinen zusatzfl geln und slicks wie war das gef hl f r dich
379092 mit den slicks hast du viel mehr bodenhaftung und wir sind daher ganz einfach schneller unterwegs auch wenn das von strecke zu strecke verschieden ist in jerez waren wir etwa eine bis eineinhalb sekunden schneller in barcelona waren wir um zwei bis drei sekunden schneller obwohl wir die beschneidung der aerodynamik haben
379093 seid ihr da also aufgrund der reduktion der zusatzfl gel auf den geraden um so viel schneller
379094 nein eigentlich sind wir in den kurven schneller beim bremsen weil halt die slicks mehr bodenhaftung haben und wir damit den mechanischen grip doch wesentlich erh hen
379095 das hei t die reduktion der zusatzfl gel macht gar nicht so viel speedreduktion aus wie die slicks an performancezuwachs hergeben
379096 ja genau und die techniker sind ja auch nicht bl d
379097 um wie viel schnellere rundenzeiten wird man dann im n chsten jahr haben
379098 je nach strecke werden das eine bis drei sekunden sein
379099 ja da muss man wieder ein bisschen h rter trainieren im fitnesscenter
379100 die reduktion der zusatzfl gel ich nehme nicht an das die autos dann aussehen werden wie ein zehn jahre alter formel 3000
379101 sie werden ja nicht v llig anders aussehen du musst dir nur die h lfte dieser luftleitbleche wegdenken ich denke dass die n chstj hrigen autos sehr sch n sein werden denn man reduziert ja alles auf das wesentliche auf ein minimum und minimalistische autos gefallen mir sehr gut
379102 man wird halt dann vielleicht noch mehr als bislang versuchen mit der reinen form noch mehr abtrieb zu erzeugen
379103 aber das tut man ja ohnehin schon die ganze zeit so extreme dinge in hinblick auf die form der autos wird es wahrscheinlich nicht geben
379104 nein das glaube ich nicht das wird immer schwierig sein weil die besten zwanzig piloten gegeneinander antreten die machen selten fehler es wird eventuell k nstlich erleichtert durch das kers system und durch die m glichkeit dass wir die fl geleinstellungen w hrend der fahrt verstellen d rfen
379105 ist das schon fix dass es verstellbare fl gelelemente geben wird
379106 das kann ich dir jetzt nicht sagen aber ich hoffe nicht denn ich halte nichts davon aerodynamische elemente zu verstellen
379107 als sie das verboten haben gab es einen grund daf r weil n mlich einige dinge passiert sind auch wenn sich die technologie weiterentwickelt hat steckt man doch tief in der materie drinnen und es ist eine challenge zu sagen du musst eine clevere aerodynamik machen die halt abtrieb erzeugt aber zugleich so gut wie keinen luftwiderstand
379108 betrachtest du es also prinzipiell f r gef hrlich wenn aerodynamische elemente vom cockpit aus verstellt werden k nnen
379109 ja ich finde es gef hrlich und ich war berrascht dass die fia mit so einem vorschlag kommt
379110 apropos gefahr es sind ja auch die neuen stadtkurse recht schnell
379111 da sagt man ja dass es nicht so gef hrlich ist weil die autos dort in einem stumpfen winkel in die mauern einschlagen aber man hat am letzten wochenende gesehen wenn die autos zur ckgeschleudert werden auf die stra e dann kann es durchaus zu gef hrlichen frontalen kollisionen kommen oder
379112 naja diese modernen stadtkurse sind ja eher rennstrecken in der stadt da gibt es ja gen gend auslaufzonen da sind die sicherheitszonen viel gr er als zum beispiel in monaco monaco ist von der durchschnittsgeschwindigkeit her sehr gering und die marshalls sind dort schon so auf zack und die geschichte hat uns in monaco gezeigt dass es dort immer relativ glimpflich ausgegangen ist wen es dort gr bere unf lle gab
379113 also glaubst du nicht dass es gef hrlich sein kann mit 300 km h durch solche betonschl uche zu jagen
379114 schau greift nach der fahrerlagerkarte des redakteurs dreht diese um anm
379115 ich habe mit stirling moss gesprochen er meinte f r ihn sei es eine tiefe befriedigung gewesen diesen lebensgef hrlichen sport zu berleben er sagte auch dass er nicht sicher sei ob ihm die formel 1 heute wo es keine todesopfer gibt diesen kick gegeben h tte ob er da berhaupt fahren h tte wollen
379116 ich glaube es ist nur nat rlich und logisch dass sich kein mensch gerne in gefahr bringt selbst ein so genannter adrenalinjunkie der einen freedive oder was auch immer macht ist eigentlich am berleben interessiert er bringt sich zwar n her an die gefahr und das bringt ihm einen gewissen kick aber er checkt dennoch seine ausr stung dreimal und schaut zur sicherheit noch einmal ob der schirm auch richtig gefaltet worden ist weil sonst k nnte er ja gleich gegen die wand h pfen
379117 gesunde menschen sind nicht suizidgef hrdet gehen ohne suizidlechzen in den tag hinein so auch wir und wenn du wei t welche verbesserungen es im bereich der sicherheit noch geben kann dann ist es nur legitim dass du das eben auch gerne h ttest wenn ein rennfahrer von heute mit einer zeitmaschine in die 1970er jahre zur ckreisen w rde dann w rde er genauso angasen oder in den heutigen rennautos in denen es ein bisschen gef hrlicher ist als in der formel 1 zum beispiel in le mans da gast du auch voll an und gehst ans limit und wenn sie nicht mit modernen kohlefaserchassis sondern mit aluchassis fahren m ssten dann w rden sie trotzdem alle angasen wie die wilden nur etwas k nstlich gef hrlicher zu machen das finde ich halt nicht zeitgem
379118 wenn man jetzt mit kers die feuerunf lle zur ckbringen w rde wo es nun schon so lange keine mehr gab dann w re das ja auch pervers
379119 naja ich glaube nicht dass man mit kers die feuerunf lle zur ckbringen wird nur weil es da jetzt einen zwischenfall mit kers gab weil ein mechaniker einen stromschlag erhielt das sind dinge die auch in der serie passiert sind wo es normalerweise gewisse sicherheitsvorschriften gibt so wie es auch bei uns bei honda der fall war wo man gewisse aufladungsmessungen durchgef hrt hat bevor der mechaniker das auto angreift das war bei bmw offensichtlich nicht der fall warum auch immer aber man kann das kers schon sicher gestalten es ist jetzt nicht so dass wir da auf einer atombombe herumfahren da gibt es gewisse sicherheitsvorschriften die muss man beachten das ist genauso wie in allen anderen bereichen in der formel 1
379120 f r einen normal denkenden stra enautofahrer ist das v llig egal
379121 die zus tzliche leistung die man mit kers abrufen wird soll ja in den n chsten drei jahren gesteigert werden am anfang also im jahr 2009 wird diese energie noch relativ gering sein oder
379122 sicher die leistung die wir anfangs pro runde extra verbrauchen d rfen ist nat rlich nicht sehr hoch nur wenn du wei t dass dir zwei bis drei ps auf der geraden drei bis vier km h bringen dann ist das f r die formel 1 sehr viel f r einen normal denkenden stra enautofahrer ist das v llig egal nur hier in der formel 1 wo alles ohnehin so eng zusammen ist macht genau das den unterschied aus
379123 aber dr cken dann nicht ohnehin wieder beide konkurrenten auf den knopf
379124 ja aber dann ist es eben eine strategiestory du kannst den anderen fahrer ein bisschen reintheatern und es wird immer noch fahrerische unterschiede geben der eine muss sich vielleicht verteidigen weil er einen fehler gemacht hat wenn ich einen fehler gemacht habe dann werde ich mein ding wohl eher nicht verbrauchen und dann hab ich es bei der n chsten geraden einfacher also da muss man dann halt ein bisschen mitdenken ich finde das wird schon spannend sein
379125 also eine art von poker oder schachspiel aber auf eine positive art und weise
379126 und die boostphasen wird man im tv ja sehen oder
379127 das wei ich nicht ich habe der fia gesagt sie m ssen unbedingt ein licht am auto anbringen damit man es f r jeden ersichtlich sehen kann bei gr n ist er voll bei rot ist er leer
379128 this is not encouraging the rate is low compared to the progress of malaysia

379154 i think its critically important that we see continued service for our local businesses
379155 bay ferries has worked very hard through the downturn in the tourism industry rising fuel prices and the rising dollar
379156 there was a sense of relief it will be around to 2011 people had lots of praise for all levels of government working co operatively
379157 the government wants to sustain the economic ties that we have built over the years through the ferry service
379158 with this funding we continue to provide a safe and reliable service and maintain important economic and tourism links within our region and within the country
379159 its better than the alternative but in the long run what is needed is stable long term funding
379160 all this is doing is moving the guillotine two years down the road
379161 there is limited air service in the area no rail service and with the higher cost of fuel its better to go by the ferry than to ship all those goods by transport truck around the long way

379167 to discreetly validate identification before that person boards the train and the person may never frankly even be aware that there was a spot check done
379168 in that particular case we had an employee who had remarked on the fact that there were a number of signs that something was a bit not right with that situation and they took steps to alert authorities
379169 there may be people occasionally in train stations whose job it is to look out for untoward or unusual behaviours or objects who simply may be in plain clothes
379170 im assuming that its partly for explosive materials but it could also be for contraband

379189 and i still do i cannot believe this hes a nice guy
379190 i was thinking something was wrong it just wasnt in his character not to deliver papers

379209 its downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
379210 it should be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed they will call him the one

379221 lead the world in battling immediate evils and promoting the ultimate good
379222 must maintain the strongest best equipped military in the world in order to defeat and deter conventional threats
379223 all obama really promises is to be a better smarter imperialist
379224 he just came picked up his papers didnt talk to anybody picked up his papers and did his things
379225 he indicated hed need a day off at the end of the month and he had to go to winnipeg for an interview and he would get back to me when he knew the day
379226 monday morning he picked up his newspapers and that was it he picked up his newspapers and fell off the face of the earth
379227 she basically just said that she didnt know where he was and that he had told her hed left out of town on an emergency
379228 it was just a total shock i would have never thought this would ever happen
379229 there was nothing to believe or suggest that he would have it in him to do something like this
379230 they the driver and passengers were very brave they reacted swiftly and calmly in exiting the bus and as a result nobody else was injured
379231 there is no way he could have provoked that guy no way hes just not like that

379233 he just came picked up his papers didnt talk to anybody picked up his papers and did his things

379237 you werent kidding reverse is a pain in the butt
379238 autonomy is vital if a university is to fulfil its commitment to the society it serves
379239 it allows for the teaching of ideas and concepts that challenge the status quo and do not conform to particular ideologies
379240 the nato summit conference briefing materials were not adequately safeguarded
379241 genuinely had no idea what documents she was referring to
379242 since investigators were not able to interview ms couillard the investigation could not determine the circumstances by which she came into possession of the classified documents
379243 the incident itself was injurious to the national interest by tarnishing canadas good reputation within nato circles for safeguarding classified information
379244 what they are seemingly trying to do here is to put the blame almost entirely on mme couillard
379245 aboriginal women experience higher rates of violence if that burden is going to be lifted the socioeconomic conditions and prosperity gap between aboriginals and non aboriginals will have to be addressed
379246 in order to make aboriginal womens lives safe and secure the conservative government must implement measures to address its root causes such as poverty
379247 all of these measures and others are part of what were doing to help first nations women deal with some of the issues that face them
379248 some problems persist with how individual policy measures are calculated and with their projected emission reductions
379249 individual policy measures continue to be presented without these sources of overestimation adequately being taken into account
379250 the modelling that the government of canada uses is just that modelling it changes year by year depending on the different data that we get
379251 i have never been more horrified by a news report in my life
379252 not only does my heart break for this young man but for his family who had to hear the horrible details
379253 the shock waves from this senseless tragedy are felt all over the world my deepest sympathy r i p from germany
379254 the person who is responsible for his actions should be put into the electric chair
379255 i am so afraid this suspect will be found mentally ill and be a free bird in society again after being made better yeah right
379256 the cuban athletes were badly taken care of that city has the privilege of hosting that championship every year we should analyze whether it is worth attending that tournament
379257 they do not have to deal with an economic blockade both countries have great resources no one steals or plunders their athletes
379258 it is disgusting to read about the details of the commercial arrangements surrounding the case
379259 im not sure castro can really have a handle on edmonton since hes never been here
379260 if i couldnt go to a tap and get a drink of water i dont know what id do
379261 i dont really give it much thought actually i figure north battlefords got to have clean water bottled water just doesnt taste the same
379262 big city water in this country is absolutely fine but the problem with assuring safe potable water is that it takes a minimum degree of microbiological knowledge and engineering skill and a supporting infrastructure
379263 doing that requires you have a large enough customer base so you can afford the high quality relatively expensive services
379264 ontario is a paragon of sanity compared to british columbia where you have a third of the population and 4 000 water suppliers
379265 every small town every little place has its own jealously guarded water systems most of which have inadequate treatment
379266 the real problem with canadian drinking water quality is we have far too many rinky dink suppliers and theyre too small to produce the level of safety that our society seems to demand
379267 they can have effects on reproduction some pharmaceuticals estrogens testosterone some pesticides the endocrine system is the one that produces hormones and it is very very sensitive and there are chemicals in the water that influence the endocrine system of fish
379268 i think the reproductive effects are potentially important and we do hear about human fertility issues sperm count in males decreasing problems with learning difficulties in children allergies asthma cancers there are so many things we dont have an explanation for
379269 those systems will catch quite a few numbers of nasties like oils and very complex large chain molecules like pcbs they dont do well at all with these endocrine disruptors
379270 most pesticides and fertilizers that get into our streams and rivers never pass through a sewage treatment plant it is really really serious
379271 what if we manage the dams in the mountains in a different way what if we held the water in there instead of opening it up at different times in the year and ran it off in june and july when the water is low what would that do to the ecosystem
379272 right now there are large water users such as agriculture so agriculture right now is like the water bank
379273 theres a real problem with drawing on that water bank because water is food if you draw down on that water bank and take food out of the system where are we
379274 i think we still have time to fix things and all we need to do is change the way we are thinking about water and what we put into water
379275 the prognosis of recovery from age related medical problems is not good
379276 were not going to have a polar bear for an extended period of time
379277 were not going to do a quick fix because we dont think that will do justice to the zoo or the animal
379278 it is significant she has survived to 2008 the international year of the polar bear
379279 i knew he was coming back from the exhibition he travels with the ex
379280 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
379281 i was completely shocked cuz tim has never been a roughhousing guy he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
379282 from what i hear this other guy is three times his size
379283 i dont think that it was racially motivated but i think there are racial overtones to what did happen
379284 i think the incident started with a mistaken identity situation but i think that once it escalated to the point of the beating that there will be racial overtones that come forward remarks that were made insults language that would be racially inflammatory
379285 i just think its so totally out of character for anything like that to have happened here i just could not believe it was true
379286 those actions were so not in keeping with what were known for here
379287 the fact that im here has helped me understand many many things
379288 i fell on this site that explained that there were mistakes here in st johns
379289 this is certainly not what we set out to do
379290 we have apologized to the patients for the stress and anxiety that they have gone through and we continue to do that
379291 beginning of the end of a way of life for generations
379292 this is a bittersweet moment for tobacco growers and their families
379293 todays announcement signals the beginning of the end of a way of life for generations of tobacco farm families
379294 theres a lot of people who feel the same way
379295 there was just way too much pressure on this community through no fault of our own and it needed to be lifted
379296 this is just about finding a way to move forward the uncertainty in this community has been the tough part over the years
379297 farming is a business but its also a proud way of life that goes back generations
379298 the crop will be smaller so i doubt theyll need the share growers
379299 if tobacco goes out that equipment is worthless plus were out of a job
379300 its a problem that these initiatives have been eliminated but there is now 300 million for tobacco farmers
379301 our goal is to get the iphone client out as quickly as possible because it does represent a significant percentage of the devices touching our network
379302 the apple guys are really smart and they have a beautiful phone
379303 were building this bridge quickly but were building it safely
379304 this is a bridge of its time and a bridge for the future its not about looking at the past
379305 theres a great sense of pride in whats being accomplished
379306 it looked like it was all set up for something spectacular
379307 i was expecting nothing i was just trying to see the ball
379308 it felt good to get that first hit out of the way
379309 we are disappointed in this outcome but our complete review and this final decision is in the best interest of our program
379310 we must provide an even playing field for all our equine athletes if we are to continue to offer the best thoroughbred racing in the world
379311 impegnato ad affiancare al tavolo tecnico un tavolo politico istituzionale
379312 kuidas te saate seda kutsuda nimetuks m2eks meil aborigeenidel on selle m2e kohta nimi olnud tuhandeid aastaid jarndrunmunha aga meie k2est te ju ei kysinud
379313 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or t he most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
379314 its broad based weakness not huge declines anywhere but very widely spread
379315 its a slow drop deterioration not catastrophic but every month it gets worse
379316 there are some real macro indicators that point to unemployment spiking
379317 its ugly there are just not a lot of jobs out there
379318 theyre sending me e mails of customer service positions at 10 an hour
379319 today the commission tells comcast to stop and to disclose to its subscribers how it is going to manage traffic
379320 the commission will remain vigilant in protecting consumers access to content on the internet
379321 simply managing their network they had arbitrarily picked an application and blocked their subscribers access to it
379322 disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable
379323 raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions
379324 the fcc is poised for massive unprecedented regulation of the internet
379325 this dangerous path would limit freedom stifle innovation and entrepreneurship and kill american jobs
379326 some people said it was unlikely that it wont happen
379327 the market is going to be soft for a couple of years
379328 while there is much uncertainty we expect weak economic growth and soft u s lodging demand to persist into 2009
379329 but the fact remains that the city and the state put money into the expanded convention center and you do not have enough rooms in town to fully utilize the center
379330 in order to book the convention center youve got to have the hotel rooms first in the long term it should increase lodging demand in the city because the city will be able to handle large groups
379331 we wanted a quiet presence of a building not flashy that would wear well over time
379332 the goal was to have this hotel feel uniquely baltimore
379333 the good news is theres been no acceleration in the official data
379334 the bad news is theres nothing about the data that suggests improvement anytime soon
379335 its not that unemployment is rising because a lot of people are coming into the labor force
379336 and really what matters in the end is whats taking place in payrolls and the unemployment rate and theyre both moving in the direction of a labor market recession how can you argue with that
379337 we see a number of opportunities to grow a business that we believe has been underserved in recent years
379338 this has been on our list for a long time
379339 this is the single best acquisition we could have made in north america in our category from a scale perspective
379340 we see this as a potential for growth even in the kind of economy we have now
379341 we want to bring in these local and regional concepts so you give a unique flavor to the services provided at bwi
379342 well continue trying to add to and improve the program
379343 theres a lot going on that is supporting all these illicit activities
379344 its really its own little world operating off of itself and we got an interesting sneak peak at how that world operates
379345 theyre out in the open for anyone to come and purchase what they have to sell
379346 phishing is successful because of our reliance on static identifiers
379347 what we really need is a revamp of the financial system in how identities are established in the real world
379348 when we get to the point where i can pull your credit report and even with all that information i cant steal your identity thats when weve made some progress rather than a technological band aid which may soften the situation for a while
379349 culex mosquitoes prefer to feed on birds rather than people or other mammals and although we have not had a positive human case of west nile virus for the past four years it is important that we notify vermonters when we identify the first positive sample
379350 some of the boys from the old ladies home up the river i e sing sing came down to the waterfront and made good
379351 im proud to have my picture taken with them and proud to be in their company
379352 patent litigation has become a risky game plan and now companies carefully evaluate the potential business benefits the effort is not worthwhile unless you are sure of gaining at least a 10 million profit by the challenge
379353 we will try and create excitement in the market around the festival period however i do not see price cuts as a tool towards this
379354 we have aggressive plans in place for the festival season as we realise the customer has already taken a hit with the recent price hike therefore we are considering options to keep his spirits high
379355 apart from launching new products during the season we are also trying to strengthen our existing categories and increasing our focus on the premium category of the market
379356 for a marketer delivery on these parameters gains greater importance than enticing consumers with short term benefits such as gifts
379357 the impending price increase in ctvs because of the anti dumping duty will definitely have an adverse impact on consumer sentiment in the market in the months leading to the festivals
379358 wettbewerber aus dem nahen osten aber auch billigflieger die rascher lohnkosten senken k nnen werden zunehmend zur herausforderung
379359 die lohnerh hung von r ckwirkend 5 1 prozent und ab januar 2009 f r ein halbes jahr um 2 3 prozent f llt sicher etwas hoch aus
379360 ber alle branchen hinweg wird der anstieg der tarifl hne in diesem jahr bei etwa 3 3 prozent liegen
379361 das ist der h chste anstieg seit mitte der 90er jahre
379362 die teuerung frisst einen gro teil der lohnerh hungen wieder auf
379363 ein theater eine konzerthalle ein kunstzentrum museum oder ein hnliches etablissement
379364 is that there will be a next time and it could be as soon as tomorrow
379365 fresh produce travels a mean of 1 500 miles to get to our plates
379366 feedlots can hold 300 000 head of cattle outbreaks involving several hundred victims no longer shock us
379367 unfortunately if fda chooses to limit the information they share with states we are likewise limited in how useful our assistance will be to them
379368 fda failed to ask states to provide them with information we now know they needed and we had no way of knowing what kind of data that was without them telling us
379369 is what it is it worked it was just slow
379370 we have commissioned a study on the various competition issues in the civil aviation sector in india among other things the study will look at performance of airlines in various city pairs as well as the time slots allotted to various airlines
379371 while market share of an airline just shows its share of the total number of passengers carried in the country looking at a sector wise market might be very different for instance while low cost carrier go air has an overall market share of 3 1 per cent it has a disproportionately larger share of around 13 per cent in the mumbai delhi sector
379372 the growth in sales will come from the power brands brand extensions and the new launches
379373 the amount fixed as reserve price for any isp is not reasonable and will lead to monopoly rs 700 crore which has been earmarked for a pan india licence is unfair
379374 such service cannot be commercialised in a day when the government is stressing better broadband penetration if the raw material the spectrum becomes more costlier this will translate into high prices for the consumer as well

379383 rails has a few obvious flaws domain objects must inherit from a common persistent base class the templating technology does look a whole like the embedded java that failed for this community and ruby is probably not as fast as java further early in the rails development process developers rely heavily on scaffolding to get things off of the ground quickly that might lead to immediate productivity but the gains will surely dwindle over time as the scaffolding is replaced
379384 if a it isnt derived from b then it isnt a proper object model
379385 well can you hang around a couple of minutes she wont be long
379386 he must be a king he hasn t got expletive deleted all over him
379387 our querying approach was wrong lets step back and specify nothing at all
379388 with better modularity clearer big picture design and less code
379389 where are the people so we can eat the best food
379390 say no to obama yes to clinton or its mccain
379391 though your sins are like scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they are red as crimson they shall be like wool
379392 this is truly a river that is too mighty for the layman to run let us build a sign and a wall to keep the public safely out let there be no more good people drown here
379393 it is better to have loved and lost then to have never loved at all
379394 better is an opinion and a term of comparison it might be better to love and lose then to never love at all but both might be worse then a root canal
379395 i am 85 sure that i am going to shortcut the hike but finish it now
379396 i am going to bike across the us and get home in a few weeks
379397 the iraqi government is refusing any individual step to change the situation in kirkuk and it is considering it illegal and unconstitutional
379398 todays agreement represents a major step forward to opening civil nuclear cooperation with india while strengthening the worlds nonproliferation regime
379399 we believe this is important not only for us and our bilateral relationship with india but for the rest of the world
379400 this is an important day for india and for our civil nuclear initiative for the resumption of indias cooperation with our friends abroad
379401 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honor the commitments made to the international community
379402 we have been blocked since 2003 the fact that our web site is unblocked is very good news
379403 if tykeem was white it wouldnt be like this if it was the other way around tykeem would have gotten first degree
379404 f no he shot and killed a little f ing kid thats why
379405 they rejected the idea that tykeem law was threatening anybody with his hands or under his shirt they said they had a long discussion about whether the one shot was meant to kill or was meant just to shoot him
379406 they concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that they could only agree that he meyers meant to injure him tykeem or cause serious bodily injury and not that he intended to kill him with that one shot
379407 im a pediatrician and i was incredibly sad and pretty determined that the information in that report makes a difference in the lives of children in philadelphia going forward
379408 this is a top to bottom look at what needs to change
379409 they should not be going to jail for the work they do
379410 my members should not be the only people on the chopping block
379411 they dont do their jobs in a vacuum this goes all the way up the chain they were all supervised by a supervisor who was supervised by an administrator who was supervised by a director
379412 this case traumatized the agency when it came out two years ago and it has been very alive since then
379413 not to diminish the case but the district attorneys report is using testimony about a time that isnt today
379414 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
379415 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
379416 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
379417 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
379418 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
379419 the best equal opportunity employer in the country is the u s military
379420 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
379421 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
379422 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing
379423 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
379424 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
379425 his rent was due and he didnt want to ask his parents for money so he had no options
379426 he said he fired shots until guadalupe wasnt moving any more
379427 were a good family we dont do anybody any harm
379428 reginald was a good guy hed give you the shirt off his back even if he didnt know you
379429 i have to recognize that when im on my bike im living for the moment the only thing that is guaranteed is the moment this moment five minutes from now is not guaranteed
379430 we have a lot more repairs coming in like flats and people waiting while the work is done
379431 its not a whole lot theres always room for more
379432 then i felt three sharp pains in my back i wondered if this is what it feels like to be shot
379433 i literally save thousands of dollars a year what with no car insurance car payments and obviously gasoline
379434 im making money by saving it and im keeping myself healthy at the same time
379435 we all cross bridges and im not talking about metaphors
379436 im sure my client and his family are very happy he will not be spending his entire life in prison
379437 he got a fair trial i dont see any errors on which to appeal
379438 how do you find third degree murder for killing a 14 year old kid
379439 really its the kind of thing you expect kids to do its very unusual to see adults behaving in as ridiculous a manner
379440 it helps when your alarm clock goes off at 5 in the morning to know that youre running with a cause
379441 its a terrible thing that happened but beau is inspiring people even while hes not here
379442 he wanted to do that in the classroom but now he is doing it in a completely different way that he never would have imagined
379443 were looking for a way to celebrate beaus life and when meg came to me it seemed like the perfect way to do that and we just wanted to offer as much help as possible
379444 hopefully we get a lot of people to come out and raise enough money for both the runner and beaus mom and hope some good comes out of it for raising awareness of violence and crime in philadelphia
379445 its weird in a way that i have a new connection to these kids
379446 i mean im not from philadelphia and most of these kids have had uncles or cousins who were shot and now its just a new way for me to reach out to them and say hey listen i may not look like you but i am sharing the same things going through the same thing youre going through and i hope to educate these kids about who beau was first off and secondly how important it is for them to stay in school and to not become a person who would do something like this
379447 we sit at home watching tv thats it i am happy to be back
379448 everything has slowed down the economy is bad the gas prices people have to drive here and there is no public transportation in this town there are too many restaurants and they are opening three or four more up
379449 it appeared that he had fallen or slipped and the gun discharged
379450 im not sure what he was planning to do either relocate the turtle or dispatch it
379451 i would imagine if you introduced ducks and snapping turtles the turtles are going to eat very well
379452 a wonderful guy a very well respected and well liked police officer if we ever needed a canine even though he was with bensalem he would always come out and try to help us
379453 were all heartbroken for his family he had his retirement to look forward to and had a beautiful piece of property that he loved

379455 if you ask me if the housing marketing is going to experience a downturn i have to ask you
379456 when affordability is at an all time low as it is in california where housing prices have appreciated 300 over past eight years you lose velocity or the ability to sell a house at a brisk pace
379457 while we wish that every post on this blog could be about cool features or other blogger news sometimes we have to step in and admit a mistake a number of users have had their blogs mistakenly marked as spam and wanted to sound off real quick to let you know that despite it being friday afternoon we are working hard to sort this out so to those folks who have received an email saying that your blog has been classified as spam and cant post right now we offer our sincere apologies for the trouble we hope to have this resolved shortly and appreciate your patience as we work through the kinks

379463 the american ambassador to the united nations in the middle of the 1970s daniel patrick moynihan has thus congratulated himself in his memoirs for having rendered
379464 instead of simply utilizing nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence they the us will start manufacturing bombs and other devices of mass destruction for the purpose of actually using them and the most important point i believe is that they clearly stated their intention to use those weapons in combat
379465 overwheening even crazy and criminal by what it implies and one that did not come out of president bush juniors head to be implemented by an extreme right junta seizing power through dubious elections
379466 it is the project which the ruling class of the united states has unceasingly nurtured since 1945 even though its implementation evidently passed through ups and downs encountered a few vicissitudes and was here and there checked and could be not be pursued with the consistency and violence that this implied in certain conjunctural moments like that following the disintegration of the soviet union
379467 the objective of us global policy is not just power for its own sake but the
379468 it is notably in the middle east and surrounding the question of palestine that the united states has systematically instituted impunity in the face of violations of international law
379469 when i speak before american university students i say this to them if i were to write a book called the american empire for dummies page one would say dont ever look for the moral factor us foreign policy has no moral factor built into its dna clear your mind of that baggage which only gets in the way of seeing beyond the clich s and the platitudes they feed us
379470 military necessity does not admit of the inflicting of suffering for the sake of suffering or revenge nor of wounding except in fight nor of torture to extort confessions it does not admit of the use of poison in any way or of the wanton devastation of a district art 16
379471 such a felt sense of political responsibility for empires actions by its citizens is dependent on viewing oneself not as an innocent or impotent bystander but rather as an implicated agent
379472 do have a responsibility to act to resist empire this is based on an analysis of the impunity of empire for it is the idea that there is a nonreciprocal right of empire to run roughshod over everyone else in the name of spreading its own values and its own conception of security globally one of the essential hallmarks of empires law that must be contested
379473 ethically motivated and informed global action has no adequately global instruments
379474 what the american empire fears and i think rightly is that such strategies may contribute to our capacities to become the strong my claim is that such politically inspired attempts litigating against american empire under international humanitarian law may contribute to the goals of cultivating a sense of poitical responsibility while both depending on political action for their broad effectivity and contributing to further political action
379475 if success has gone to anyones head and they show signs they are ready to rest on their laurels they will soon be on their way
379476 soon i will look into the eyes of my players to make sure they have retained the hunger they need to succeed then we will look forward
379477 ive never said this to anyone before but after that last operation i did think will he ever be the same again
379478 i could never share that with fred because you have to be upbeat so to see him come in the other night was fantastic and a massive relief
379479 i genuinely believe in my heart of hearts with the way that i felt at the end of last season that i will come back this season
379480 ive trained through the summer and i genuinely feel ill be fine but until youve gone out there and done it it means nothing
379481 ive got to go and do the very best i can to stay at manchester united because thats the only place where i really want to play football
379482 over the last few decades revolutions in technology and communication have made it so that corporations can send good jobs wherever theres an internet connection children in missouri arent just growing up competing for good jobs with children in california or indiana but with children in china and india as well
379483 it was irresponsible decisions that were made on wall street and in washington in the past few years we have relearned the essential truth that in the long run we cannot have a thriving wall street and a struggling main street
379484 so we have a choice to make in this election we can either choose a new direction for our economy or we can keep doing what weve been doing
379485 we can choose to do nothing about disappearing jobs and shuttered factories for another four years or we can encourage job creation in the united states of america
379486 i came here to this tournament to look at my team for the game against portsmouth and i need to prepare my team for that game
379487 if i have a chance to put three or four more players into the game i will if not i will follow my idea for the game against portsmouth
379488 when i was on holiday i never went on to the internet i never read the newspapers so to be honest i was with my family so my phone was off so i didnt know what was happening
379489 when i came back i realised what was happening but you know the thing has happened already so now the most important thing is behind me and i will show everyone this club has given me a lot of things
379490 now i can tell everyone that yes i will sign a contract
379491 i have four more years contract i am very happy that we have found a solution to stay here and my heart is with arsenal
379492 all i have to do is play my football and i know the fans always love me so there is no reason to not love me anymore because i am still here
379493 now we have to work hard together as a family and to deliver better than what we did last season
379494 what we hope to achieve is the title and the champions league
379495 it is true we are young but we know that if we put our hearts together and we work as a family we can achieve something
379496 i dont think that the best tactic is to come out with names
379497 it is hypocrisy personified tottenham are complaining about things they have done themselves
379498 they took away our manager and now they are complaining that others are trying to take their players
379499 ive come here with a big price tag and i just wanted to get off to a good start and hit the ground running to be honest
379500 i havent been playing many games so it was tough getting back into the swing of things but i was delighted to get a goal i loved every minute of it
379501 weve signed a lot of good players this summer so its going to be a good season

379503 t he problem for national newspapers online audience is that they are not and can never be communities
379504 following the model t s skyrocketing success came mail order catalogs and magazine advertisements filled with parts and kits to turn the humble fords into farm tractors mobile sawmills snowmobiles racy roadsters and even semi trucks
379505 we have all lost that which we loved healer it is the nature of the game

379512 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
379513 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
379514 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism
379515 detected an apparent anthrax leak in december 2001 at the height of the anthrax mailings investigation but did not report it
379516 the political and journalistic establishment suddenly seems united in wanting to attack iraq
379517 now that we know that the us govt believes that anthrax came from the inside shouldnt cohen be a wee bit curious about what this warning was based on
379518 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program
379519 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab
379520 some of this anthrax may and i emphasize may have come from iraq

379639 but there is still a lot of cricket to be played this season and i hope at the end of it we will finish on top
379640 i just want to cement my place in the team not necessarily as an opener
379641 if it means opening the batting then so be it but i would like a top four place
379642 i want to make it easy for the selectors to point the finger at me and pencil me into the team first not be on the borderline
379643 i want to make myself one of the first choices rather than a borderline pick and i can do that by scoring the runs because they mean even more in division one
379644 runs speak louder than words and i just have to make sure i keep putting the runs together
379645 as for england i am 24 and i have worked on things in my game and have the potential
379646 ive added more and more strings to my bow and strengths in my technique and now i have got to go on to the next level

379649 vaughany said something very important to me just before i went out to bat and said dont be reckless but be aggressive and i quite enjoyed having that freedom from the skipper
379650 i was going out there and trying to take the bowlers on which is how i play my best cricket and so it was nice to go out there and try to score from ball one
379651 i wasnt going to change my way from ball one i said i was going to go out there and be aggressive i wanted to go out there and give it a good go
379652 i just wanted to continue in that manner whether i was in the 90s or we were six down and really forget about the situation and just watch the ball and hit it and it worked for me
379653 i havent scored the runs so far in test cricket this year and i was under a lot of pressure
379654 it wasnt pressure so much from the outside but pressure knowing that i had to contribute and feeling as if ive let the team down when i hadnt contributed and thats how its felt over the last few months
379655 it was very special it was one of those days where everything went my way and its certainly a day ill never forget because its been tough over the last couple of months
379656 it simply wasnt good enough and we have got that out of the way in the dressing room we have got a gift in the morning and thats the second new ball and we have to make it work
379657 the game is on a knife edge we asked the guys to forget about outcomes and we actually forgot about everything else we spoke about

379669 when they behead someone they say allah akbar they read koranic verse
379670 the young people they think that is islam so islam is a failure not only in the students minds but also in the community
379671 they have changed their views about religion they started to hate religious men they make jokes about them because they feel disgusted by them

379897 this process has involved studying and attempting to understand the geology and hydrogeology of the property and surrounding area the history and culture of the land and community and the countys comprehensive plan among other things
379898 based on what we have found thus far we feel that this is a viable site for a quarry but each of these areas of study has presented its own set of obstacles that need further analysis and thought
379899 in order to allow for this evaluation we are suspending all current activities at the site including any work toward submitting an application to the county we anticipate being able to provide further updates by late spring
379900 is in their words suspending all current activities at the proposed site of a quarry in clarke county
379901 we disagree however with the proposition that this is a viable site for a quarry
379902 our technical consultants have told us that a quarry operation would cause substantial environmental harm on the fragile limestone karst geology of clarke county would create unacceptable dangers to the geology and watershed of the surrounding area and impair the agricultural livelihood of immediate and more distant neighbors
379903 we are hopeful that on further consideration of this potential quarry site luck stone will conclude that the geologic hydrogeologic and environmental details of this area in clarke county preclude the acquisition and operation of a quarry
379904 few construction projects are planned today without consideration for how they may utilize materials and practices that make the project more sustainable concrete provides many opportunities to help make projects more green and the foundation is proud to present this new cd of deliverables that demonstrate many of concretes environmental benefits
379905 many of the reports included on this cd are available for download individually from the foundations website however combining them together on one cd unmistakably illuminates that concrete has a great deal to offer as a sustainable building material

379916 my governments view on daylight saving is absolutely crystal clear and one of the first things i announced when i became premier
379917 we undertook a major survey and have made all of the results available
379918 it is not a popular decision and has not been easy for some people but i have a very strong view that the shape and nature of our state is one where daylight saving simply wont work
379919 its up to the proponents of daylight saving to convince governments otherwise but they havent been able to do it
379920 for the life of me i just cant understand why the state government insists on ignoring daylight saving
379921 i am aware that it would affect farmers up north but that doesnt compare to how people are adversely affected down here
379922 motivated by avarice and greed at the expense of safety and human life
379923 the decision has not been taken lightly and comes against a backdrop of exceptionally difficult market conditions rising stock levels and increased energy prices
379924 we have been severely affected by low housing levels and the fact that more people are moving into flats and maisonettes meaning there is less demand for bigger properties to be built
379925 we have tried to push our business further afield but it is a very competitive industry and at the moment we are making bricks a lot faster than we are selling them
379926 production costs are not demand led and we cannot cope with hikes in energy prices
379927 but we are mothballing the factory because we dont want to walk away from our valuable resources
379928 if the market picks up as the government promises then work can be resumed
379929 this is a real blow for caernarfon and for the workers and my thoughts are with them and their families
