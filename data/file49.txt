490014 ive been dealing with the truth that i have at times been a bad example and or glorified self destructive behavior this was never intentional but rather a consequence of leading a public life in plain sight and never expecting any sort of preferential treatment isolation or protection

490019 everybody got off the bus me and a trucker that stopped and the greyhound driver ran up to the door to maybe see if the guy was still alive or we could help or something like that
490020 and when we all got up we saw that the guy was cutting off the guys head when he saw us he came back to the front of the bus told the driver to shut the door he pressed the button and the door shut but it didnt shut in time and the guy was able to get his knife out and take a swipe at us

490022 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal

490027 the people of ithe united states of america and the people of iowa are wise voting for barack obama for president of the united states learder of the free world and commander in chief is the political equivalent of bungee jumping
490028 especially if youre a little up there along there in the way of life you think it might be a good idea or intereesting at the time and then you gete to the edge of the cliff and look over and you think this is not such a wise idea
490029 barack obama stood up at a speech recently and said said that one of the things that is really important from energy policy from his standpoint is to check the pressure in our tired so heres a tire guage and you go out in the parking lot here and check your tires now the interesting thing we want you to have good pressure in your tires you know it will very mildly add to your fuel efficiency but checking the air pressure in your tires is not an energy policy for the united states of america

490036 there are those relationships that open you up to something new and exotic those that are old and familiar those that bring up lots of questions those that bring you somewhere unexpected those that bring you far from where you started and those that bring you back but the most exciting challenging and significant relationship of all is the one you have with yourself and if you can find someone to love the you you love well thats just fabulous
490037 the only way to true happiness is to live in the moment and not be worried about the future
490038 the most important thing in life is your family there are days you love them and others you dont but in the end theyre the people you always come home to sometimes its the family youre born into and sometimes its the one you make for yourself
490039 thats the thing about needs sometimes when you get them met you dont need them anymore
490040 when youre young your whole life is about the pursuit of fun then you grow up and learn to be cautious you could break a bone or a heart you look before you leap and sometimes you dont leap at all because theres not always someone there to catch you and in life theres no safety net when did it stop being fun and start being scary
490041 but maybe the best any of us can do is not quit play the hand weve been dealt and accessorize what weve got
490042 when it comes to relationships maybe were all in glass houses and shouldnt throw stones because you can never really know some people are settling down some are settling and some people refuse to settle for anything less

490087 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
490088 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
490089 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
490090 if weve got a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like then obviously thats something that i would consider because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
490091 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
490092 thats how we can protect our coastline and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good
490093 its not going to provide short term relief or medium term relief or in fact long term relief it wont drop prices in this administration or in the next administration or in the administration after that
490094 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
490095 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
490096 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling
490097 the president has failed in his economic policy and now he wants to say but for drilling in protected areas offshore our economy would be thriving and the price of gas would be lower
490098 that hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to relieve the pain of consumers at the pump and to promote energy independence
490099 people everywhere confuse what they read in newspapers with news

490155 many black parents have told us that physical punishment is part of black culture
490156 when they beat their kids they are sending a message that it is okay to use violence to resolve conflicts
490157 beat their kids not to discipline them but to exorcise their own demons they take their anger out on the child
490158 serves as a whupping object for peevish adults these beatings often produce angry children who treat others as violently as they have been treated
490159 words like youre stupid youre an idiot im sorry you were born or youll never amount to anything can stick a dagger in a childs heart

490175 said he wanted above all else to get black people to shed the idea that they did not control their destiny
490176 education was a radical tool of liberation for black people so recently enslaved and purposely denied the chance to learn
490177 very few new ideas are allowed into this stifling echo chamber
490178 the official message from civil rights leaders remains the same black people are victims of the system and the government needs to increase social spending even the most dysfunctional and criminal behavior among black people is not to be criticized by black leaders

490276 its not really surprising that rufus has the necessary equipment although it does make her wonder exactly how much of this was planned and for how long the process of getting the strap on on would be awkward and embarrassing if she wasnt so worked up well and if rufus and tseng werent distracting the intentness of rufus expression as he slides slick fingers into tseng and the sound of tseng not making a sound swallowing a sound his teeth pressing briefly against his lower lip
490277 she positions herself her hands braced on the bed and begins to push into him and he makes a fantastic noise another swallowed moan his eyes are shut its as if hes unwilling to make any noise but unable to stop himself he tilts his head back and his hair spreads out as she begins to build up a pace shes unsure at first but the look on his face and the way hes almost but not quite making noise gives her confidence i always was pretty good at improvising

490350 its certainly a big win for clearwire because i think what ampd had there was clearly one of the most compelling data offerings out there

490352 it will clearly help them on the content side its just that content is not one of the top two or three decision factors its price quality and service

490354 you have a really fast pipe youre biggest challenge as a wimax provider is how are you going to fill up that pipe
490355 people dont typically pay a premium for faster download speeds you know what else is there the biggest broadband hog where you can actually raise prices is television we all bite the bullet and pay more every year for our cable tv

490357 pinning our hopes on a single national white knight to offer only one new pipe is risky at best

490361 we entered this debate to ensure that fcc policy would enable a viable commercial enterprise to meet public safetys needs through a partnership but without commitments to ensuring competition such as wholesale obligations we are disappointed the risk is that this spectrum will simply be warehoused by the largest carriers rather than turned loose to meet public safetys needs

490367 i cant stop that were working to mitigate that but its not easy for us to do that if they want to port out we need them to come in now
490368 we went through a lot of that thought process and we really wrestled with it and what was the best thing to do
490369 is a little different because we are billing in advance for the base plan and for usage in arrears

490479 since many in the antismoking community including hundreds of organizations many with their own attorneys as well as lawyers associated with antismoking groups and others in private practice are now considering how to proceed with the articles litigation suggestion the need to remind doctors of their responsibilities and of their potential legal liability is paramount
490480 it should not be surprising if antismoking lawyers as well as those in private practice working on contingency fees find physicians who deliberately flout federal guidelines to be a major target of litigation

490494 this is a very important occasion not just a party
490495 we live in a hypocritical society even if people dont say they dislike you for being gay they never quite accept you
490496 it is about showing that we are here that it is time that lesbian women who walk hand in hand in the street are not gawked at or spat on as happened to a friend of mine
490497 we are here to show that being a pink family is ok
490498 the parade serves a dual purpose to celebrate that we can be who we are and that we can do it in the open and to be visible building acceptance of homosexuality
490499 we are here for the party but also for the struggle
490500 the number of incidents of discrimination and of violence against gay people has increased in the past year
490501 it is time to stop talking about tolerance and focus instead on acceptance of sexual differences in
490502 as gay people we still get the feeling that we want to be more open but it is difficult to do so in the workplace on the sportsfield
490503 society still expects of gay people to behave normally society needs to start accepting that we add value through our differentness

490510 the sure thing is that president christofias does not give out the message of the just and fair society that he was promising before the presidential elections
490511 without knowing all the details i am against granting any form of clemency because no one is above the law
490512 as a matter of principle all people are equal before the law
490513 if it is judged that someone should be granted clemency the reasons behind this form of pardon should be known so it does not upset the citizens because they have a right to know
490514 i am sure that if the president granted his pardon it is for important reasons
490515 i will not judge president christofias decision for pardoning the young lawyer but i would like to point out that some people in society such as lawyers mps and doctors have to be an example of upholding the law and of proper social behaviour
490516 i do not personally know the circumstances under which the pardon was granted or the reasons as to why it was suggested but if it was granted under no significant grounds it is unjustifiable and no one can be above the law everyone should be equal before the law and since no explanations were given each citizen has the right to believe that because of her profession as lawyer that makes her more equal to the law

490565 were always concerned about what the other side has to say against us
490566 but if you present credible testimony of the actual murderer its hard to say someone would have found turner guilty
490567 my most anger has been toward billy brown he murdered an innocent young lady and sent me to prison and upset countless lives but im not so angry anymore i do still harbor some feeling toward the prosecutors but its not a hatred

490599 we are pleased that we have this opportunity to partner up with such a fine company and industry leader as amerimulch
490600 what is happening in the pallet market a pallet profile exclusive market summary
490601 because of the extremely high temperature we make the dies out of the same material that we developed for the automatic nailing machines
490602 guaranteed through rigorous and continuous third party inspections by qualified inspection agencies
490603 this will be a guaranteed buyback system so once its up and running it will be a nominal cost program funded by its participants well repair the pallets and the pallets will belong to the system the participants will own a fraction of the system
490604 the demands of the two campaign organizations would perpetrate a
490605 veilig vrijen is over en altijd van belang zowel in nederland als in het buitenland in veel populaire vakantielanden komen soa en hiv infecties vaker voor dan in eigen land het is nu eenmaal een feit dat jongeren op vakantie sneller seks hebben dan onder normale omstandigheden
490606 onveilige seks met iemand uit n van deze landen verhoogt dus de kans op een hiv infectie of een soa
490607 veel jongeren komen dan ook met een soa terug van vakantie of maken zich tijdens of na de vakantie zorgen dat ze misschien iets hebben opgelopen of zwanger zijn daarbij komt nog dat bijna de helft van de jongeren die geen relatie hebben geen pakje condooms meeneemt dat is de reden dat we hier staan we geven voorlichting over veilig vrijen en voor iedereen hebben we gratis condooms
490608 from my point of view and my practice thats the biggest problem
490609 the administration has serious concerns with the expedited and one size fits all regulatory approach required by the bill which will impact as many as 200 000 workplaces in a variety of industries throughout the united states
490610 what farmers are facing as a result of the green shift is a considerable increase in input costs whether its a result of fuel that farmers use or even as a result of how much their input costs may go up as a result of this carbon tax
490611 what were basically saying is look agriculture already provides a lot of carbon sequestration farmers have done all kinds of things to create more carbon sinks were saying look theres got to be some calculations here that agriculture provides this theyre the solution providers so why tax them
490612 i was on a series of meetings in the farm community last week and had farmers say to me if theres an exemption made for us we would be looked down on by the rest of society
490613 the action to purchase wood pallets over plastic pallets is due to budget constraints and asset management issues with plastic pallets from an operational and engineering perspective the twin sheet thermoformed plastic pallet is still the pallet of preference
490614 while we prefer plastic pallets for their performance they are leaking out of our system almost one for one
490615 the usps picked the right pallet they did a good job of deciding who gets the pallets and who did not what they have not done well is create the basic structure to get their pallets back they have never created a closed loop
490616 the pallet business is still very competitive so we try to take advantage of any efficiencies we can to help bolster our bottom line
490617 we have also employed new technologies that have enabled us to realize a 20 increase in fuel efficiency
490618 this is now an integral part of our business model so we are expanding from just pallets into being more of a total recycler
490619 when we collect pallets to bring them into our shop our suppliers might have a bin or two of plastic
490620 it really doesnt pay for them to go to the effort to bale and save that material or the cardboard they accumulate so we allow them to put it on our trucks as a service which makes our relationships tighter so not only are they getting rid of their scrap pallets but they can get rid of all the scrap items on their dock
490621 as we accumulate trailer loads of plastic or cardboard we sell them
490622 we take advantage of a lower quality log market and buy the cheapest logs we can get
490623 it takes anywhere from six months to a year to clean up all the trees that come down during a storm and weve had a number of them recently so the wood is very available
490624 say a tree removal company has to remove some trees we do them a favor by picking up those trees if they have to cut them to put them on our truck we pay about 250 or 300 per truckload so what we pay for a truckload of wood isnt really dependent upon the lumber markets
490625 we can store a years worth of wood in our log yard and when a storm comes through we might get close to capacity in our log yard if there isnt a storm coming through for six months we might have to start eating into that inventory but over the period of a year there are always a few storms that allow us to bolster our supply again the whole time i have been in the sawmill business we have never run out of lumber
490626 they bring down green ash trees these logs are coming through and adding significantly to our supply we are a certified expeditor of emerald ash borer logs
490627 about 75 of what we bring in is done as a result of our direct relationships with our suppliers
490628 another 25 percent is done on a sub contracting basis with our national brokers
490629 we just keep upgrading every three years we just recently bought the latest model
490630 we are very happy with it because it does everything i can imagine any recycler would want it to do it grinds the used pallets and broken pallet parts to a consistency that is very marketable as landscape mulch
490631 my credo is times of change are times of opportunity
490632 walter credits the companys strong operational strength to continued growth
490633 we have been doing this for 31 years now and developed and implemented efficiencies over the years that give us an added advantage over our competitors
490634 we work with osha to make sure our workplace is very safe for our employees
490635 our production has gone up at least 1 000 2 000 pallets per week since adding the ams line the biggest advantage it offers is greater consistency and we are doing it all with fewer people too
490636 the ams system is variable speed we have it running at what i like to think is the sweet spot to maximize quality and our production needs
490637 about 10 000 pallets per week leave our facility sixty percent of our business is 48 by 40
490638 the ams line solved one of my biggest concerns by moving the final inspection process to the end of the line
490639 the cost of our workmans compensation coverage has been reduced by using automation we have far fewer reports of work related injuries by eliminating manual stacking and handling of pallets
490640 once its on the line its ready for new components
490641 six or seven people on the repair line any given day
490642 my uncle started the business and after a few months he tapped dad
490643 walter cronkite was talking to an economist on a radio show and kenny heard him say something about new pallet orders being an effective economic indicator of future growth or slowdowns
490644 kenny thought about the high timber prices and the lack of recycling of existing used pallets
490645 my dad was in home remodeling and building and was used to swinging hammers
490646 we use a lot of metal baskets to collect waste
490647 we can take care of our grinding needs in two to three hours per week
490648 im buying used reclaimed material from other pallet companies occasionally well buy cut stock 2 rarely 1 stock for some stringers we do combo work for two or three clients that we service about 1 000 per week
490649 weve equipped ourselves to be as competitive as we can be
490650 i like working with the people that i come into contact with on a day to day basis
490651 we make a conscious effort to recycle as many of our products as possible
490652 last christmas we gave trees to our customers to plant
490653 he was a truck driver and saw a lot of pallets in many locations then a light bulb went off he started picking them up and repairing them in his back yard and reselling them he saw a need and he fulfilled it
490654 due to some redevelopment in the area about five years ago we decided to relocate
490655 because of our original location on route 21 for approximately 22 years tony pallet became a landmark in the area many people referred to peters father in law as tony pallet instead of tony russo after anthony passed away in 2004 his sister vera russo took over the business
490656 since vera assumed the presidency weve modeled ourselves like a big corporation
490657 we did a big marketing blitz in 2006 where we changed our logo upgraded our web site increased our marketing budget and added signage to our trailers with the new logo
490658 we often obtain business from companies who are unsatisfied with the service of their current provider
490659 someone always answers the phone during business hours and we do have an automated answering service after hours so customers can always leave a message for us
490660 if someone needs an odd size pallet they call us
490661 we lost all our machinery the structure and even our electricity the fire actually melted the steel i beams in the building
490662 there was a three week investigation which affected some of our operations although the company was able to meet all of its customers needs
490663 we were forced to use new material to repair pallets for almost two weeks
490664 i started contacting our insurance companies right away and stayed on that very diligently
490665 i also started trying to find equipment right away one of the companies i talked to was trace equipment and i ended up getting a lot of our new equipment from them
490666 we had one time that we needed a hydraulic part on the dismantler
490667 one of the unique things we do is count every piece of wood and by that i mean every pallet and every piece of lumber that comes through the door
490668 from there pallets are separated into good repairable and not repairable but we go one step farther we also separate them by size
490669 right now we have about 40 trailers dropped at our customers facilities
490670 we do get a few people who come in off the street who bring us pallets but the majority of the pallets come from existing customers
490671 that means if we dont have any 48x48s on order for the week and we have 200 of them in inventory already we dont repair any that size
490672 our main lumber supplier is brown and schramm lumber company in pennsylvania
490673 we also buy from a few other companies based on market price and on whats available
490674 when the pallet is put on the dismantler it separates the runners from the boards
490675 the boards go on a conveyor and from the conveyor they go onto one of the trim saws and are cut to size the runners are sent to a revolving turntable and are stacked then the other trim saw is used just to cut boards when we need a particular length
490676 we use the bandsaw dismantlers for larger size pallets and block style pallets
490677 we brought in an osha consulting service in 2006 with a follow up in 2007
490678 we only lease the yard workers and the truck drivers we have final say on the hiring process but the leasing company runs all the background checks and makes sure everyone is legal to be in the country when we saw all the immigration issues coming about we didnt worry because we already knew we had everything under control
490679 that makes everything easy for us because we can focus on business

490729 we thought the stuff would be legal by now and look at it people getting busted for it and seeing time like they did in the 1950s that utopia we dreamed about and threw rocks at the cops for sure took a nosedive instead we have a brave new world drug scene where doctors pass out pills whose sole role is to homogenize our emotions and our essential beings

490733 our study deals with issues vital to the protection of every american family
490734 how will america respond to another major terrorist attack even a nuclear one how will we deal with future natural disasters like hurricane katrina at home and conflicts abroad the way our national security system is structured plays an enormous role in the answers to these questions
490735 the key message is that we have many impressive capabilities in national security and they work well individually but todays complex problems require more integrated effort and agility than the current system can deliver

490799 it was very beautiful and big it showed a lot of chinese history
490800 the policy at the moment is that you have to play in the previous competition to the all blacks team being named and by that we usually mean the super 14 before the tri nations or the air new zealand cup before the november tour
490801 the prospect of him coming back and playing for say otahuhu for two weeks before becoming an all black is not the way we do things
490802 so even if we relented and said were going to pick players from offshore we wouldnt get them now
490803 wed ended up picking two very different all blacks one for the iveco series in june and the november internationals because those are the two windows and another team for the tri nations because thats outside the window
490804 were not ignoring the possibility but at the moment theres a very clear policy not to do it
490805 were are very concerned by the advice we have received as to the date of the french final and thats a matter well be taking further
490806 we arent happy with it and well be speaking to the irb and the french about it as will the australians
490807 its too early to make a bullish statement about that but its a continuation of the issue around release of players from europe
490808 im happy to be where i am and if the opportunity came again to drive for team new zealand id jump at it
490809 i have made some errors but when youre pushing at the top of any sport those mistakes happen
490810 these are tough conditions up here it was hot north queensland played some pretty good footy
490811 we werent doing a lot of things right in the first half but the other team looked a little bit more willing than we did
490812 it was a bit disappointing from a point of view that i thought we had more to play for
490813 it was a major turning point in the game that penalty
490814 i felt pretty happy out there especially with the second qualifying session
490815 i was a bit disappointed with the last session though because i had too slow an outlap and couldnt get my tyres properly up to temperature
490816 and i was also much more exhausted by all the media stuff that followed hockenheim
490817 being all over the front pages of the newspapers in germany after the crash was not the reason i came into formula one i want to be on the front pages for good qualifying and race results not for crashing my car
490818 closed shop the executive dont let anyone in and at the annual meeting last year they didnt want other people voted on to the executive and thats where the whole saga began
490819 the sentiment nationwide is that surfing nz has to buck its ideas up and move forward but bruce scott is quite bull headed about defending his position and he wont concede there are other points of view its not very professional and it doesnt look good for the sport
490820 maybe if bruce scott would stand down or get voted off the whole thing changes
490821 its a shame surfing taranaki had to take surfing nz to court but that was the only neutral theatre in which they could get any satisfaction because surfing nz has been really arrogant
490822 i think if he doesnt go the problems will be compounded if he stays there are still things that need to be straightened out such as employees being on the executive committee
490823 ive known all the players all my life on both sides and im pretty pissed off with bruce for the way hes run surfing nz and his involvement in the whangamata marina
490824 founders syndrome when someone starts something and it needs to move on and they havent got the capabilities
490825 we need surfing new zealand to be a vibrant organisation it needs to be an organisation that moves with the times and trends and is captured neither by individuals or corporations
490826 if the meeting is chaired by him it wont go well at all i want the agm to be a way forward but i think the way forward wont be with bruce scott because hes been so divisive his position is untenable now
490827 both sides should have seen the court case as a chance to turn things around but its gone totally the other way bruce might have agendas that are quite sound but he still has to listen to the members he cant be so autocratic if anything is put in front of him thats not his way forward he doesnt listen to it
490828 in recent times there has been many accusations misrepresentations and personal attacks on me and individuals involved with snz by a few malcontents i do not intend to address these any further
490829 i personally look forward to being involved with the ongoing growth and development of snz and will be re standing for president at the forthcoming annual general meeting and hope to see all supporters of surfing new zealand in hamilton onseptember 27

490863 im just hoping this little niggle wont hold me back as i need to stay fit

490865 there were different things that kept me back and stopped me being as fit as i should have been
490866 i missed a lot of pre season last year with a thigh problem and thats what held me back i wasnt fit enough to challenge for a place in the team
490867 this season ive made sure ive been right ive worked very hard the manager wants us to be one of the fittest teams in the league
490868 im still a newcastle united player and i have to be professional about it
490869 whatever happens in the next month or so i have to make sure my heads right

490871 this is the fittest ive been in a few years and hopefully that can translate into playing more games i need to improve my form
490872 i have to look after myself and no matter how much i love the club i have to satisfy my need for first team football
490873 im working hard fitness has been a big issue for me in the last two or three years

490876 its just about me keeping up my fitness thats the main thing for me
490877 the last couple of years have been frustrating for me
490878 i need to be playing regardless of how much i love the club
490879 what is interesting is that newcastle are still following skjelbred and are preparing to lodge a 4 5m bid for him if their bigger transfer targets slip out of their hands
490880 which is also why skjelbred is putting off signing a new deal with rosenborg he does not want to make things messy if newcastle or another club he might find interesting comes in for him before the end of the transfer window

490889 billy got a second booking for a tackle early in the second half but it was his first booking which was his misdemeanour as he showed a bit of petulance in the first half to get booked
490890 its a little blot in his copybook really because he has probably been our most influential player in this tournament but hell learn from it im sure

490916 im a huge comic book fan and ive wanted to do some comic book work for a while now and what better way to get my start than with a wrestling comic so when headlocked writer creator mike kingston asked me if i would be interested in doing a cover i jumped at the chance
490917 the mans been on television in movies and hes a household name to three generations of wrestling fans so were obviously very pleased to be publishing jerry lawlers first comic book work
490918 ive always been a huge lawler fan i used to trade for tapes of memphis wrestling back before you could find everything on the internet getting to work with him and actually getting to watch him physically paint the cover has easily been my career highlight thus far
490919 its a story about all the crazy stuff that goes into what you see on television when a guy shows up on a wwe show he most likely already has four to seven years in the wrestling business but you rarely hear anything about that headlocked is the chronicle of that journey for mike hartmann
490920 he approaches wrestling the same way he did acting he bulks up just like an actor preparing for an action movie and he moves to philadelphia which is essentially hollywood for aspiring wrestlers because of his background were able to put a little more focus on the craft of professional wrestling and examine its place as a true performance art
490921 there are a lot of coming of age themes in headlocked the story is just as much about hartmann becoming a man as it is about him becoming a wrestler hes a nineteen year old college kid who has given up his relatively safe existence to chase this crazy dream and at the same time hes almost totally reinventing who he is from the ground up hes pretty much out there on his own in a new city trying to forge this new identity for himself while navigating through the darker underbelly of the wrestling business as a total outsider
490922 hartmann has just moved to philadelphia having secured a tryout with the legendary leo

490929 allah curse those person who perform the act of people of lout
490930 narrated by muhammad ibn ishaq from amru bin abi amru 6 there has been a debate between jurists as to whether the act of liwat constitutes zina or not there are different of opinion regarding this matter 7 a group of jurists held the opinion that liwat amounts to zina while some differs to opine that liwat does not constitute zina the latter is the opinion by majority of jurists the jurists in the first group who said that liwat amounts to zina based their argument on one hadith from abu musa where the prophet said when a man came to another man and had a carnal relation both of them are adulterer they also supported their view with the synonymous nature and characteristic in both act liwat and zina these jurists said liwat shares similar characteristics of zina physically and in term of its objective 9 physically there is a carnal intercourse involved in both acts objectively the main aim of liwat and on the other hand jurists which consist of the majority in the second group who opined that liwat does not constitute zina argued that custom and norms of the society does not treat liwat as zina they said that if a person makes an oath or promise that he will not commit the offence of zina but later involves in liwat he would not be regarded as having breach his oath or promise 10 the jurists who favour this view opined that the former hadith used by the jurists in the first group to support their opinion that liwat amount to zina does not meant to equalize liwat with the offence of zina technically they said such hadith tries to suggest that liwat is a sinful and condemned act just like zina 11 this is because in another hadith the prophet said if a woman came to another woman and had an intimate relation they are adulteresses
490931 a man came to the prophet who was in the mosque and said i have committed zina but i regretted it so much this statement was repeated for four times the prophet then asked the man are you insane the man answered no then the prophet further asked the man are you a muhsan
490932 those whom you found perfoming the act of people of lout kill them both the active and the passive partner
490933 the upper and the lower partner should be stoned to death
490934 a man shall not look into the aurah of another man and a woman shall not look into the laurah of another woman nor can two men be in one b blanket and nor can two women be in the one blanket as well
490935 if woman came to another women had an intimate relation they are adulteresses
490936 why did they not produce four witnesses since they have not produced witnesses then with allah they are the liars

490939 and imam thawri said that the apostate is asked to repent indefinitely and he will be imprisoned until he repents or dies
490940 al nakhi and al thawri have gone towards the view that he the apostate is asked to repent while in prison indefinitely
490941 and the scholars differed on the female apostate as well imam malik uthman al bitti al shafi and laith bin sad have said that the apostate regardless of their sex is executed and this is the view of ibrahim al nakhi their evidence is the apparent generality of the hadiths that do not qualify any gender

490980 la responsabilidad de uno va creciendo m s con llamado al tri
490981 es un gran equipo el actual campe n a pesar de haber perdido contra el am rica yo creo que jug un buen partido y ahora m s en su casa en la presentaci n ante su gente yo creo que ser un partido dif cil
490982 es un partido que va a ser dif cil santos tiene un equipo que es muy fuerte en su casa ser un partido distinto a lo que fue el de necaxa donde necaxa vino a esperarnos santos desde el primer minuto con el apoyo de su gente va a salirnos a presionar y a tratar de sacar un triunfo es su primer partido en casa nosotros tenemos que ser ordenados y pacientes como fuimos ante necaxa para tratar de buscar los espacios que pueda dejar santos para tratar de sumar puntos fuera de casa que ser n muy importantes
490983 la responsabilidad de uno va creciendo con el tiempo y m s ahorita con la convocatoria de la selecci n pero estoy tranquilo tratar de hacer las cosas bien como siempre he hecho con pumas tratar de ser un jugador importante y sumar para que se logren los objetivos
490984 s estamos trabajando para si dios quiere hacer un buen juego all poder ganar que es lo que queremos y seguir teniendo los primeros lugares
490985 s pero hay que trabajarlo el equipo ha hecho muy bien las cosas en los dos primeros partidos y esperemos seguir mejorando va a ser un rival muy dif cil y ojal y podamos traer los tres puntos
490986 s pero tiene jugadores interesantes jugadores buenos las canchas cuando uno juega de visita o los equipos que juegan de local se hacen muy fuertes y sin duda va a ser un rival bastante complicado
490987 quiz s nosotros tenemos que prepararnos a conciencia a mejorar tanto individual como colectivamente y ser un equipo que vaya en ascenso
490988 claro yo creo que tenemos que ser concientes de las cosas que se han hecho bien y mal y pensar que tenemos que mejorar d a con d a
490989 s que se busca trascender y crecer en todos los sentidos
490990 creo que es algo que ten a que pasar estoy un poco ansioso de jugar en casa y por supuesto esperando que salgan las cosas bien tanto individualmente como en lo colectivo para poder quedar satisfecho al final del encuentro es decir hacer un buen partido y por supuesto pensando en ganar
490991 s que se busca trascender y crecer en todos los sentidos me siento muy integrado muy bien con objetivos claros hay un grupo con calidad con ganas de trascender simplemente me sumo a lo que el equipo tiene contemplado en cuanto a logros quiere trascender y seguir creciendo en todos los sentidos tanto humanamente como deportivamente creo que el grupo me inspira eso espero que se cumplan las metas que el equipo tiene en mente
490992 la afici n debe de ser exigente pero tambi n debe de apoyar al equipo eso es fundamental porque lo que pretendemos es hacer de morelia una plaza dif cil y es importante que nosotros hagamos las cosas que nos corresponden lo mejor posible pero tambi n el apoyo de la gente si esa qu mica existe el equipo tiene que ser muy s lido como plaza que es lo que pretendemos ojal que exista est qu mica para que cada que se pare un equipo aqu en morelia se lo piense
490993 triste por la forma en que nos ganaron lamentablemente se perdi ellos hicieron su partido y nosotros no pudimos sacar ventaja de ese jugador que ten amos de m s el equipo siempre busc el gol s lo que a veces hay partidos donde no entra la pelota muestra de esto el partido ante tecos
490994 fue la jugada en la cual yo quer a que me pasar el bal n pero l juan antonio olvera decidi hacer esa jugada ahora tenemos que corregir ese tipo de errores que cuestan puntos fue una desatenci n apoyo a mi compa ero y no pasa nada son errores
490995 es un partido muy bonito que cualquiera quisiera jugar tenemos una oportunidad muy buena para hacer bien las cosas con este rival tan importante tenemos que disfrutar el encuentro porque no se repiten mucho estamos concentrados vi ndolo de esa manera
490996 es una buena afici n siempre apoyando y m s que va pumas
490997 sabemos c mo juega santos tiene hombres importantes ellos van a jugar al frente en torre n nosotros debemos hacer nuestro partido cuidar el cero y tratar de buscar los goles
490998 es una buena afici n siempre apoyando y m s que va pumas que tratar de ganar lo sabe la gente lo sabe el equipo va a ser un buen espect culo para la gente
490999 es un rival dif cil pero nosotros vamos con la consigna de ganar y sacar los tres puntos
491000 sabemos de la capacidad en la delantera de ellos de la capacidad que tienen como grupo hay que estar bien atentos y las que tengamos meterlas
491001 las derrotas nunca son buenas pero siempre es importante que se asimilen como una buena experiencia para sacarle el mayor provecho posible para que no nos vuelva a suceder acciones como del partido pasado tecos y podamos ganar los pr ximos duelos
491002 tenemos que mejorar en todas las l neas es importante dar un levant n para que nos permita aspirar a cosas importantes no me quede muy contento con el partido contra tecos por lo mismo tenemos que mejorar en todos los aspectos
491003 lamentablemente es la cuarta baja que sufrimos para este torneo la de omar bravo
491004 le veo todo positivo es un equipo que juega y deja jugar normalmente tiene grandes jugadores mi equipo se puede enfrentar a ellos puesto que es un est mulo importante para tener respuesta para continuar con el torneo mexicano
491005 un gran jugador es un jugador que a demostrado a lo largo de se estad a aqu en m xico lo buen jugador que es tengo la suerte de ser su amigo y compa ero en la selecci n y esperando que este domingo podamos neutralizar a todo el am rica y no solamente a l
491006 nosotros no estamos acostumbrados a hacer marca hombre a hombre solamente tendremos un cuidado especial porque tanto salvador caba as como alfredo moreno se mueven bien trataremos que siempre este un jugador sobrando tratar de que uno vaya encima y otro sobrando porque sabemos que cuando tienen espacio son peligrosos ante el m nimo descuido siempre te terminan las jugadas
491007 el am rica m s que un jugador es un equipo complicado nosotros vamos a hacer un equipo agresivo aqu en casa queremos recuperarnos de la derrota que tuvimos ellos seguro estar n pensando que va a ser un partido dif cil y nosotros tambi n lo pensamos
491008 obviamente es un partido dif cil no es un partido f cil venimos de una derrota pero si queremos ser m s incisivos creemos que siendo m s incisivos podemos darle un dolor de cabeza a cualquiera
491009 contento motivado ilusionado por este nuevo reto ahora con el se or eriksson sven g ran espero ganarme su confianza para seguir en ese buen camino que hasta el momento he llevado del mismo modo tratar de estar en la eliminatoria mundialista y porque no en el mundial tambi n
491010 quiero asegurar mi lugar en la selecci n claro que para esto tengo que demostrar con hechos
491011 ha sido una semana pesadita para nosotros la lesi n de omar arellano y porque perdimos m s lo cerca que tenemos los partidos pues muscularmente te afecta un poco debemos cuidarnos hasta donde se pueda pero sabiendo que siempre tienes que entrenar al m ximo
491012 las cosas tenemos que asimilarlas r pidamente ya que se vienen cosas interesantes ahora trataremos de estar de buen nimo para encarar todos los compromisos
491013 es bueno en el partido de la primera jornada con cruz azul de visitantes hicimos un muy buen partido ante tecos juagamos de regular a malo pero en general ha sido aceptable teniendo que tomar precauciones alex

491017 vamos a hacer el estudio posterior a esto ya podremos decir algo en concreto por lo pronto aparenta ser una sobredistenci n muscular pero queremos descartar que no sea un desgarro
491018 es muy probable que se pierda la convocatoria a la selecci n mexicana
491019 no es un equipo de una rotaci n permanente de doce jugadores ni pretende serlo
491020 no qued conforme con el juego tuvimos muchos altibajos demasiados malos pasajes de b squetbol s estoy conforme con el volumen de trabajo que tuvimos
491021 no se pudo entrenar como el equipo pretende jugar en cuanto a roles y minutos repartidos
491022 a sergio hern ndez le est faltando confianza en el recambio porque se est en partidos de preparaci n y hay dos jugadores que pr cticamente no juegan y otros que pisan la cancha dos o tres minutos
491023 hay siete u ocho jugadores que est n acostumbrados a este nivel para el resto es su primera experiencia lo l gico es que tengan una rotaci n mucho menor
491024 no somos un equipo de una rotaci n permanente de doce jugadores ni pretendemos serlo

491109 this crop is directly related to your pump the feasibility of this crop is dictated by the number that shows up on the pump the higher the price at the pump the more feasible this is
491110 and thats a good thing for oregon farmers actually northwest farmers
491111 and this is a crop that can grow easily and nicely on dry land
491112 it does well on marginal land were looking for growers who have soil that is marginal there are literally millions of acres in oregon where the soil is marginal
491113 this is not a food staple like corn wheat or soy beans
491114 southwest oregon area is prime climate for camelina there are also a lot more low producing soils than high producing soils here
491115 even if it comes out on the positive side you still have to weigh it against other commodities
491116 they the bomb squad are investigating the office where the explosion occurred was not manned and so far there is no indication that anyone was injured

491120 i know for a fact that they dont read anything
491121 seem very close thats why all of this crap that goes about just amazes me
491122 im quite happy with the way things are working this weekend the first day was a little bit disappointing because we struggled a bit with grip on entry into the curves but today we changed a few things this was an excellent pole its really a great achievement for us to take pole in such mixed conditions so hopefully im looking forward to a nice couple of results tomorrow
491123 before superpole i was a little bit worried because it was raining and i really feel much happier when it is getting dry because i dont like the rain anyway i try and do my best for tomorrow for sure the races will be really tough troy is always there with me at brands hatch but this time ryuichi san also so we will see tomorrow
491124 i am very happy with the result today even though i did not set pole i have been quick all weekend and i managed to continue that form today my bike is very fast and competitive superpole conditions were very difficult but for me it is a really good feeling to be on the front row of the grid at brands hatch
491125 im sad this incident happened because it interrupted a beautiful and loving party but im happy none of my people or friends got hurt and the party continues
491126 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
491127 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
491128 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam

491135 clearly the record couldnt be more plain that sen lott and his associates were talking to people that were key advisers to mr scruggs paid consultants and those who were creating an illusion that simply doesnt have any basic fact
491136 have you ever had a u s senator call you
491137 the former senator had no interest in justifying the implication with a response
491138 he will continue his efforts to depose both richard and zach scruggs during which
491139 a couple of things would ring a bell with people
491140 if you dont have anything important to say dont say it
491141 it would be wrong for the hard left to act in a manner that would reduce cruddass chances if he had a realistic chance of victory
491142 some activists from the hard left dislike mr cruddas because of his support for the iraq war foundation hospitals and the extension of 42 days detention of terror suspects

491144 fort walton beach medical center is a community of physicians nurses and staff who are proud of the care we provide our patients a tradition that has endured for 34 years
491145 we are dedicated to continually improving the quality of that care and will work with ahca dcf and cms center for medicare services to achieve a plan that will be accepted by all but we will not allow this effort to distract us from our main focus of taking care of our patients
491146 a very high number of elopements from the facility that were not reported to the state agency for health care administration as required by licensure
491147 the baker act does give us the opportunity to evaluate the patient even if they dont want to be here but it does not give us the opportunity to secure them here
491148 you dont restrain people just because theyve been baker acted
491149 demonstrated a fundamental lack of knowledge regarding the responsibilities and authority of designated receiving facilities to provide a safe and secure environment for individuals requiring a mental health evaluation
491150 this is sufficient evidence to warrant concern for the safety of individuals brought to your facility on an involuntary examination petition
491151 we are actively looking at the issues going on at the hospital
491152 we are thrilled that at last the 2009 senior games are truly on the horizon and thousands of athletes across the country are qualifying to come here next year

491154 hotels restaurants and shops will be filled with these athletes and their families
491155 the message is everyone can exercise and live a long and fulfilling life
491156 its going to be wonderful to have seniors from all 50 states coming here to compete but its going to be equally wonderful for the people of the bay area to learn the athletes stories see them compete and be inspired
491157 you see the young athletes on tv like michael phelps and might think i cant do that anymore
491158 well we have the opportunity to show that we can still do the same things its not over
491159 i think the goals are the same its to compete and be with other people

491162 as crazy as that sounds to say i wish i was still with my wife
491163 if this is a ploy her being intimate with a 19 year old kid is pretty good acting
491164 for me to be able to handle my 50 year old wife sleeping in a bed with a 19 year old boyfriend and using my gym and driving my cars and living in my house i guess weve got a pretty good act going on cause thats a lot to take on

491175 the pending injunction against google for freely re distributing headlines from belgian and french newspapers along with similar eu cases limiting file sharing activities seem to refuse the fair use doctrine often applied in the us

491192 aber am ende muss der ball ins tor was bringt mir der liebste schwiegersohn wenn er nicht trifft
491193 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
491194 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
491195 have misled the people away from the true and divine presence in the universe

491203 aici este vorba de cel mai mare lant din industria alimentar care se aliaz si sustine o asociatie care face lobby pentru emiterea de legi care pot fi folosite apoi pentru restr ngerea libert tii religioase si pentru subminarea institutiei c s toriei
491204 mcdonalds este o companie care si demonstreaz n mod activ sustinerea fat de comunitatea homosexualilor si lesbienelor
491205 of course we ran and ran and ran towards the entrance of the city hall and up to the 6th floor at first i though it was a bce version of the amazing race but on the second thought it was more of the
491206 fraizer campbell has taken his goal very well and it wont do him any harm hes an aggressive young player very quick and determined and he can do well
491207 his future lies here because dont have any strikers we only have wayne rooney and carlos tevez so fraizer comes into that area
491208 we are also hoping to apply for a work permit for manucho who comes from angola that will give us more back up
491209 carrick and rooney have been struggling with a virus for a few days and they wont be fit for the juventus game on wednesday hopefully they will be ready for the communtiy shield game
491210 other than that gary neville had a calf strain but hell be ok for wednesday
491211 i have had more than a year to get used to not playing but it doesnt get any easier and i knew this would be my last game at old trafford
491212 ish remember when you told mom your sugar was really low that was funny
491213 before i was sitting by mom and i told her
491214 distinct line between the toe heel and the rest of the boot
491215 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realisation of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
491216 i think she probably went down head first and landed on her back
491217 i wasnt expecting anybody alive at the bottom of the shaft so i was shocked
491218 thats probably something the government of pakistan ought to speak to
491219 there was a bloodcurdling scream i was just reading my book and all of a sudden i heard it
491220 it was like something between a dog howling and a baby crying i guess you could say
491221 i dont think it will leave me for a while
491222 theres nothing worse than doing all that work and having the homeowners association or local police tear them down
491223 the best signs are on bright fluorescent poster boards a color you wouldnt be caught dead wearing
491224 the fourth of july labor day not a good time to throw a yard sale people think oh im off no people are on a boat or at a lake theyre not going to be in the middle of your cul de sac shopping
491225 when something smells clean you will sell it for more than its worth
491226 placing like items with like items will help you sell twice as much as you normally would
491227 if you want something to go for 10 price it at 25 and let them have it for 10
491228 be honest with people they know where you live theyre out on your front yard for crying out loud
491229 ninety percent of the time people stop and buy something else on top of what they already have in their hands
491230 the last thing you want to do is drag it all back into your house
491231 not only will you make money at the yard sale youll get a tax write off
491232 i shall demand north korea take practical actions to find surviving abductees and allow them to return to japan
491233 it was good the people with deep knowledge of the issues stayed in the cabinet
491234 i was very encouraged i hope shell break the current deadlock with her strong leadership
491235 it will serve as a strong message to north korea
491236 nakayama is concurrently a minister for the declining birthrate im not sure whether her appointment was a result of giving priority to abduction issues but i want her to continue contributing on our behalf
491237 i believe ive been urged to use my experience to work toward the creation of a consumer affairs agency
491238 this is the clearest picture weve ever had of new hiv infections occurring in the united states
491239 we have to do more as individuals communities and a nation to make sure were doing everything we can to stop the further spread of hiv
491240 the magnitude of new infections is larger than previously thought but we have the same picture of whos at risk
491241 these new cdc numbers lend credence to what public health officials have long been saying that hiv is alive and well and thriving in certain communities in the u s
491242 using these advanced methods to paint a more accurate picture of the numbers of new hiv infections is important for working out where our prevention messages have worked and where there is a need for improvement its time to take a precision strike approach towards hiv prevention in this country
491243 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
491244 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
491245 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
491246 if weve got a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like then obviously thats something that i would consider because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
491247 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
491248 thats how we can protect our coastline and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good
491249 its not going to provide short term relief or medium term relief or in fact long term relief it wont drop prices in this administration or in the next administration or in the administration after that
491250 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
491251 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
491252 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling
491253 the president has failed in his economic policy and now he wants to say but for drilling in protected areas offshore our economy would be thriving and the price of gas would be lower
491254 that hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to relieve the pain of consumers at the pump and to promote energy independence
491255 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
491256 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
491257 the scientific community is really going to run with this
491258 im all right now but well find out tomorrow morning
491259 i hit it ok but you never know until you dont see it anymore
491260 hes a good hitter hes been in the game for a long time
491261 with a transaction that happens that quick i was able to see very limited film on him but i watched him growing up my whole life
491262 it was great for him to get that win and great mentally for his next start
491263 its great for us too to give him the ball with confidence
491264 im still disappointed with the two out runs especially with the three spot in the sixth hes got to do a better job of controlling the damage those crooked numbers hurt you and they hurt us tonight
491265 i dont want to be a disruption to the team and ive heard nick is a little out there so im going to stick with 17 and be happy with it
491266 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
491267 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
491268 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
491269 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on
491270 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
491271 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
491272 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
491273 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
491274 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
491275 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
491276 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
491277 if he rode past on his bike if he saw me working in the garden he would stop and say hi
491278 scott told me that a lot of teenagers go down there but i didnt know anything about that
491279 i was trying to act as calm as i could
491280 i didnt want to try to run away who knows what he would have done if i did
491281 they wanted me to describe what this guy looked like
491282 up until wednesday night he seemed like a normal nice guy
491283 i dont understand how they can be ranked no 1
491284 they didnt win their division last year they lost to a team that didnt go to a bowl south carolina their big triumph was beating haw a ii whos in the wac

491286 we talked about the oil boom weddings everything under the sun
491287 but nobody ever mentioned that missile i guess that shows that people arent worried about it im certainly not
491288 it has to be 100 percent stable for movement its not a quick process we have to make sure everything is stable first
491289 if there is a problem they will take care of it
491290 theyre moving them things around all the time so were used to it
491291 we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices

491312 if you had asked me about my chances before the judge ruled id have had a neutral response
491313 my family and i didnt know where to turn who to contact
491314 we were sitting there talking and the next thing you know i reached up and choked jennifer
491315 i did this on my own without any prior discussion with dustin turner he did not encourage me in any way and in fact i remember one instance while i was choking jennifer dustin trying to pull my hands away
491316 were always concerned about what the other side has to say against us
491317 but if you present credible testimony of the actual murderer its hard to say someone would have found turner guilty
491318 my most anger has been toward billy brown he murdered an innocent young lady and sent me to prison and upset countless lives but im not so angry anymore i do still harbor some feeling toward the prosecutors but its not a hatred
491319 perhaps when i walk out these gates itll be a different story

491716 its still got the same name and its still got the same purpose
491717 its community v if you want to be a part of it youll do it
491718 we were playing at recess and one of us said i saw voldemort in the field
491719 i think im going to tell someone to hide the book so i dont have to read the last five chapters
491720 im going to cry too when i get the book im already upset
491721 it relates to anyone its about good and evil its not just about wizards
491722 its really cool that its about wizards but its not just about wizards
491723 do you know how many times the who have done a comeback tour
491724 shes going to miss harry potter and the world she created its like being god
491725 the aim is to provide a resource for people with homebound businesses and a camaraderie that they otherwise might not have
491726 it was really recognized by our board during the merger that small businesses play a key role and our resources would be directed toward small business owners because they are important
491727 there is an image that a home based business isnt really as serious as a store front
491728 but its just a small business of someone whose office just happens to be at home
491729 they were on loan to fred swink as a courtesy
491730 it would be fair to say that courtesy has expired
491731 it helps us see ourselves as a very diverse community
491732 we dont just go to bars we dont just do drag we dont just wear leather we live on farms we have families
491733 we have a lot of fun but we refuse to lose
491734 you got to be athletic your heads got to be on a swivel to watch the ball youve got to be able to catch the ball you got to be agile to avoid those balls
491735 then i had to get used to the fact that older people are not treated this way in our country
491736 i still havent come down from those two years i have been there
491737 we felt we had a distinct advantage over some of the young people
491738 i think because they respected age and i didnt threaten them
491739 im safer in jordan because i was family as far as they were concerned
491740 i wasnt muslim i wasnt arab but i was family
491741 i just had a viewpoint from national geographic with images of people jumping around drinking cows blood
491742 they were ready to go at that drop of the hat
491743 this looks like a church but we are not a church
491744 we have a lot of diversity culturally radically and denominationally and thats what i like about being a base chaplain
491745 my kids grew up in the chapel sunday school theyre not sure what denomination they are
491746 thats what it means to be a chaplain and to be sensitive to others
491747 whats neat about the chapel is that the denominations kind of go away
491748 they come from different backgrounds but they serve the community
491749 they dont point it out its not a part of the message
491750 we joined the air force on our own denomination we have our own belief
491751 respect all the chaplains no matter where they come from
491752 ive been a chaplain 22 years ive never seen any real conflict because of a chaplains faith the reason we come into the chaplaincy is because of the diversity the pluralism
491753 thus was i shut out from my very own production of a lifetime
491754 ever since the first obstacle was barely built it was well used
491755 versus the curb and everyone telling them to get off the street
491756 carwashes raffle tickets kettle corn ice cream cones a lot of stuff
491757 i cant do the big ramp but i can do that small one
491758 other than warning them its kind of hard to enforce that type of thing
491759 its way more popular than baseball or any of those other sports
491760 my first 26 2 it was so cool i think annette has a picture of it somewhere
491761 before the olympics china was a myth to me old and mysterious but as i gradually came to understand china i found that it had an overwhelmingly modern atmosphere
491762 the beijing olympics is an opportunity to enliven and showcase the beauty of chinese culture as an ancient eastern nation china must leave its unique cultural spirit onto the history of the olympics for ages to come
491763 cameras video cameras and all other recording equipment are forbidden at the dress rehearsals for the opening ceremony of the beijing games scheduled for august 2 and august 5 in addition cameras and recording systems on mobile phones are not to be used during the dress rehearsals any information leaked to the public about the opening ceremony will be dealt with severely
491764 quimsa ser uno de los principales animadores de la liga
491765 a hundred years of an organization like this existing is stability
491766 it gives you a real sense of belonging and insight into the culture
491767 the masons the elks if you have any fraternal group anywhere its shrinking in membership
491768 the young people in this day and age dont have time mostly because the children are so active you have soccer mom and polo dad
491769 there was really a need before for a society where people helped each other sons of norway formed from some of those needs
491770 not too many places can say theyve been around for 100 years
491771 were working hard trying to keep it together and keep the building going
491772 im 42 and a half at heart so thats how old i am
491773 we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices
491774 la vamos a pasar s per de eso se trata esto siempre me he caracterizado por dar lo mejor de m y esta ocasi n no es la excepci n as que vamos a trabajar para eso
491775 the best hosting service ive ever worked with bar none
491776 it was a failure of institutional inclination saving danieal was just too much trouble
491777 you cant continue to bury these children and say things are getting better when theyre not
491778 the best hosting service ive ever worked with bar none
491779 why why wasnt i good enough why has my broom been exchanged for a staff my dust bunnies exchanged for monsters i served but you held out your bowl and wanted more
491780 basically monty called me this morning and told me to trip her out and get lucky
491781 she got steppy a couple times but she got there we just got a good trip
491782 we talked about getting up close and getting a good trip
491783 my filly felt real strong super and i thought she would take me to the wire
491784 after she raced last week tron smedshammer trainer came and mentioned it to me as i drove her a couple of times in the american national last year
491785 weve been second three years in a row but i had a good feeling coming in to today
491786 i didnt think she could control the race and win i didnt think anybody could it was a matter of whoever got the trip would win
491787 this is the top of the mountain i said to andy miller you started her now lets take her to the top of the mountain
491788 it was time she got a good trip like this horsemen will always make excuses but this is a superior family
491789 wir sind schwul und laufen nur einmal im jahr als fummel trinen rum manchmal hat man eben das bed rfnis frauenklamotten anzuziehen
491790 wir stehen zu unserer sexualit t und wollen die gleichen rechte wie heteros haben
491791 er hat eine rote karte f r spanien nicht gegeben ein handspiel nicht und kurz vor schluss hatten wir eine chance die er einfach abgepfiffen hat
491792 theres a line that separates having confidence and being conceited i dont cross that line but i have a lot of confidence in myself
491793 thats what i said i am a confident player and a lot of people might look at it like oh another cocky attitude but i dont look at it that way i have an opinion i have a right to have one and thats the way i feel i felt ive played against the best over the years and felt right now that im the best player in the world
491794 full metal jacket for making that comment but i believe it to be true paul pierce lucky to make the hall of fame forget about being the best player anywhere except in your own mind
491795 i entertain my guests either in coimbatore or karur which has better facilities and soon i am planning to build a guest house so that the arrangement is permanent
491796 it could not have been caused by the hot axle phenomenon that mainly occurs in summer and leaves round burn marks even the theory of short circuit does not appear plausible as all were sleeper coaches that are not easily prone to such a fire unlike the air conditioned coaches that consume heavy power
491797 i have verified here that the two persons were killed due to a local land dispute
491798 all retirees in any part of india can access this portal for job opportunities
491799 there are some jobs where experience and patience count who else can be a better candidate for these but senior citizens
491800 this is not a free speech issue this is libel there is a difference between those two things i can defend the truth i will not have my character destroyed and presented to the world as something that it is not i am not trying to prevent him from publishing his stupid book but if they publish it as it is there will be consequences and there will be a libel action
491801 locked him in a cupboard under the stairs and all went to the local pub for a pint or two
491802 when they were suitably refreshed they came back and let him out
491803 the simple fact of the matter is that nothing of this sort happened
491804 the idea of them raiding my friends wine cellars and then me asking them to pay for this is completely fictitious
491805 we were paying or rather the taxpayer was paying rushdie to protect him
491806 that was an offer made to me by senior officers of special branch it was never a request of mine to say that i was trying to extort money from them for my protection is an obscene distortion of truth
491807 we cannot afford to lose the battle against the ideologies of hatred fanaticism and against all those who seek to destroy our social fabric
491808 we have only to see the rapid integration within association of south east asian nations asean and its emergence as an important bloc in asia to understand the opportunities that beckon
491809 terrorists and extremists know no borders the recent attack on the indian embassy in kabul and the serial blasts in bangalore and ahmedabad are gruesome reminders of the barbarity that still finds a place here in south asia we must act jointly and with determination to fight this scourge we must defend the values of pluralism peaceful coexistence and the rule of law
491810 these terrorist attacks are a rapidly growing threat not just to afghanistan or india but for the entire saarc region
491811 no amount of outrage and condemnation can suffice to express the anger and frustration we all feel when faced with such mindless brutality and violence in pakistan terrorism and its sanctuaries are gaining a deeper grip as demonstrated by the tragic assassination of benazir bhutto
491812 the deadly fangs of terrorism are spreading across the region they threaten to disrupt peace and stability we must combat this menace of terrorism across the broadest possible spectrum
491813 terrorism has perpetrated brutal attacks in every part of the world we condemn the heinous terrorist attacks in afghanistan india and pakistan in recent times which caused unnecessary loss of valuable lives and property
491814 unequivocally condemned these senseless and reprehensible acts of violence regardless of how sublime noble and even desperate a cause may be
491815 shattered the entire value system of peoples and interferes with socio economic development
491816 under his leadership the party has rightly come to be known as the leading leftist party in the country working for the emancipation of the working class and the vulnerable sections of our community
491817 conditions will take away with one hand what has been given with the other
491818 would literally take away with one hand what has been given with the other
491819 the nsg guidelines apply to non nuclear weapons states nnws so our preference is for the nsg to simply say that these guidelines do not apply to india if they are unwilling to say that at a minimum the requirement of full scope safeguards and other prescriptive elements in the guidelines that are intended for nnws must be waived for india
491820 if you read the nsg guidelines as a whole right at the top it says these prescriptions are for non nuclear weapons states there is an enunciation of the requirement that countries must accept full scope safeguards there is language about what happens if one of these states tests there is restrictive language on enrichment and reprocessing enr equipment and so on
491821 of course we are very clear that there cannot be any linkage with nuclear tests
491822 but just as in the 123 agreement with the u s there cannot be any explicit linkage to nuclear testing as a condition in the nsg
491823 i am not interested in labels like the npt definition of a nuclear weapon state because we are what we are
491824 but certainly we dont want the other label to be attached to us either
491825 are any of these elements present in those agreements so our view is that all these things in the nsg are extraneous tomorrow if the political situation changes all these things can create difficulties
491826 now that a berth is allotted my journey will be comfortable i will speak to you after reaching the village
491827 when i said we have to kick udaikkanum those in karnataka opposing supply of water to tamil nadu i was referring to those who indulged in violence and not everyone in general yes i should have been more specific
491828 i have been quoted as saying that i have learnt my lesson well life is all about learning
491829 as a senior technician and as someone who has been in the industry for 40 years i wish to say that what has happened has and whatever happens hence will be for our good
491830 this is an issue pertaining not just to kuselan but to all tamil films i say this as someone observing the industry from a distance
491831 rajini only said that if his words had hurt anyone he regrets having said that
491832 he had not apologised he had only said that he was concerned that his words had possibly hurt the people of karnataka
491833 we wanted to honour the technicians involved in the film and the director and producers readily agreed i hope this trend continues
491834 i will follow this practice of sharing a portion of profits made on a film with technicians in my upcoming films too soundarya has agreed i will be speaking to director shankar too
491835 we have to have tie ups with a b c d and e but the nsg is a cartel so all countries could get together and the redundancy we are seeking to build could get reduced to a knot in one stroke
491836 our aim is for the redundancy to remain protected this is the main thing we have to achieve that is what is behind the slogan of a clean and unconditional exemption and i am firm and committed that we must get this
491837 we have six reactors that are already under separate safeguards all of them can be subsumed under the issa and as and when someone wants to cooperate with us everything else can be brought into this as well the nsg guidelines are there for the suppliers but if someone wants to trade with india the issa is useful
491838 first multilateral instrument that recognises there is a nuclear programme in the country which remains outside the civil programme
491839 so i believe the issa is useful by itself though our intention is not to remain there but to go beyond and start cooperation
491840 if you want to go to a new equilibrium you have to be in troubled waters first in a frozen situation you cannot make change
491841 and there is no reason to assume those intentions are benign i e that they are just looking for business opportunities
491842 its a bonus for anyone like me who didnt know what to do with coins and didnt throw them away
491843 everyone is totally confused maybe things will settle down in a few days its farcical at the moment
491844 is building dams on rivers flowing into the country on the other hand it is establishing training centres in afghanistan where it is teaching its agents how to carry out terrorist acts in pakistan while our rulers insist that we should have good relations with the afghan government india is imposing wars upon us still our rulers pursuing a policy of unilateral friendship under foreign pressure have promised the world we will not fight with india
491845 i have always performed better in major championships even when my results might have been below par in the rest of the contests in a particular year
491846 barring a couple of occasions anju has invariably finished among the top six in major international events
491847 i want to make beijing the most memorable moment of my life

491895 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
491896 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
491897 there is no single focus at this point it is a multiple focus accident investigation
491898 but deep down in my gut i just knew he was going to die in a plane crash

491917 my family and i didnt know where to turn who to contact
491918 we were sitting there talking and the next thing you know i reached up and choked jennifer
491919 i did this on my own without any prior discussion with dustin turner he did not encourage me in any way and in fact i remember one instance while i was choking jennifer dustin trying to pull my hands away
491920 were always concerned about what the other side has to say against us
491921 but if you present credible testimony of the actual murderer its hard to say someone would have found turner guilty
491922 my most anger has been toward billy brown he murdered an innocent young lady and sent me to prison and upset countless lives but im not so angry anymore i do still harbor some feeling toward the prosecutors but its not a hatred
491923 perhaps when i walk out these gates itll be a different story

491941 this is a very important occasion not just a party
491942 we live in a hypocritical society even if people dont say they dislike you for being gay they never quite accept you
491943 it is about showing that we are here that it is time that lesbian women who walk hand in hand in the street are not gawked at or spat on as happened to a friend of mine
491944 we are here to show that being a pink family is ok
491945 the parade serves a dual purpose to celebrate that we can be who we are and that we can do it in the open and to be visible building acceptance of homosexuality
491946 we are here for the party but also for the struggle
491947 the number of incidents of discrimination and of violence against gay people has increased in the past year
491948 it is time to stop talking about tolerance and focus instead on acceptance of sexual differences in amsterdam
491949 as gay people we still get the feeling that we want to be more open but it is difficult to do so in the workplace on the sportsfield
491950 society still expects of gay people to behave normally society needs to start accepting that we add value through our differentness
491951 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
491952 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure

491954 the primary reason is simple it would require us to bring in a 3rd party service the 3rd party service is definitely not an option we would prefer as that would cost more for the service then it would to ship the game the dvd case packaging and the dvd media printing combined
491955 the primary reason is simple it would require us to bring in a 3rd gt party service the 3rd party service is definitely not an option we gt would prefer as that would cost more for the service then it would to gt ship the game the dvd case packaging and the dvd media printing gt combined
491956 i do not want to involve a 3rd party company into our business model

491964 someone asked him to drive weve been told this woman was an illegal alien mike did not know that he had no other contact with her other than driving the winnebago
491965 stebicks planned guilty plea is not the end of this investigation
491966 this human trafficking investigation has been going on for some time and based on the information we have obtained so far its moving forward
491967 its really like going through airport screening with increased security comes increased inconvenience and we try to do our best to balance it
491968 theres recreational boating activity on this border and a threat could mingle in with it
491969 i saw a niagara county sheriffs boat stop a pleasure craft with two guys and three girls as they were leaving newfane town marina then when they got to the breakwall a sheriffs auxiliary boat stopped them later out on lake ontario a coast guard boat stopped them
491970 after running the gauntlet the crowning glory is when you pull your boat onto the trailer and have the state police or sheriffs deputies checking for trailer registration and inspection of it
491971 and that if you checked the records youd see that inspections are way ahead of the number of tickets written
491972 when a boater tells us theyve been checked by another law enforcement agency well put our boat in neutral and check with the other agency if thats the case we wont repeat the safety check
491973 its like a traffic jam you have the state police the state department of environmental conservation and erie and niagara sheriffs deputies and theres also the border patrol and homeland security
491974 we have a log on our safe boat and if deputies use an excessive amount of fuel they have to justify it

491982 what type of communication about academic progress will i receive from you
491983 i want to know as soon as possible if my child is struggling or not turning in assignments
491984 you get treats too usually some kind of food i won a bike at the awards ceremony
491985 since i like animals i want to save the environment
491986 its unrealistic to just say go out there and walk
491987 i knew there was going to be some resistance from parents
491988 they saw not only how great it is but how simple it is
491989 kids asking their parents please will you walk me to school can be an effective strategy
491990 we really need the community support to come out and buy tickets and to come out to the event
491991 we try to match the right pet with the right person

492157 after the 11th i was hoping to get to 5 or 6 under and still have a chance
492158 i missed a few shots here and there but i kept going and when you hole a shot like that on the 11th it keeps the momentum going
492159 what was really special was coming down the last eight with that great support teeing up so early compared with leaders we still had a huge crowd and it was very special coming up 18 i hope it will be like that tomorrow
492160 im here im enjoying myself im focused on my game i havent changed anything my routines are the same i have the same coach and caddy
492161 yesterday i drove the ball and couldnt miss a fairway and today i couldnt find one so that was a big difference
492162 i felt very comfortable on the tee i just dont know what happened it just didnt go straight today but my iron play was the same and i putted decent
492163 i feel much much better with the putter much better with the wedges
492164 i hit some great wedge shots today just the basic little chip shots that i expect to get close i havent been performing the way i expected and this week it feels much better i spent last week on short game exclusively and i feel like its starting to come around
492165 it was a big putt because i wanted to go into the weekend with a bit of momentum
492166 i didnt want to bogey the last two but that putt looked good and i felt i could make it
492167 im going to play my heart out and not really be concerned about how phil does hes going to be focused on his game i hope we both have a good day

492171 the usga put some pin placements on us today that almost defy the imagination
492172 its just treacherous treacherous greens out there with some unbelievable pin placements
492173 im not going to comment about the golf course the usga should know better
492174 then i hit my first tee shot on 10 and walking off the tee my neck locked up
492175 i feel my game is a lot better obviously the score doesnt show it but i know what i need to work on
492176 i gave it my best today and i felt like i did a lot of good things and hopefully that outshines the ones i made mistakes on
492177 i think if i played a couple pga events in a row it would be a different story its just hard to play one and then one maybe a year later
492178 i think if i played eight in a row and i missed all eight that would be a different story
492179 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
492180 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
492181 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there
492182 i just woke up at wachovia went to the range actually past the range and went straight to the first tee because i wanted to hit off in front of nathan green because hes a really slow player
492183 if it was like it was last year yesterday i would have shot 100
492184 i did try working once before and i didnt enjoy it very much
492185 im just sitting in a bar with my mate and he said you should go somewhere i went ive been everywhere theres nowhere i havent been he said theres got to be somewhere i said well ive never been to egypt so i went to egypt
492186 im thinking im going to sit back and look at a few pyramids and take a few photos and all of a sudden shes asking me this is the fourth dynasty of who it was like hanging out with your headmaster for a day at the age of 40 it was brutal
492187 to me him not being here is probably the difference between 38th and 39th so i dont miss him but im sure the boys up in the big money end they definitely notice a difference
492188 i hit a pole probably going about 35 mph it just jumped right out in front of me

492196 it really affected me and solheim wasnt a time to talk about it
492197 dottie was a family member to me and i dont even see her as a friend any more
492198 i think that it was a really low blow and highly disappointing really because i think that as a golfer you appreciate golf and what we are doing out here it really affected us in our hearts sherri and i thought it was ridiculous really
492199 it was more of a heart thing than anything else we had a team that was there to support us and pull us out of it i dont think sherri or i will ever look at dottie the same
492200 after the 11th i was hoping to get to 5 or 6 under and still have a chance
492201 today was a little better more regular golf i missed a few shots here and there but i kept going and when you hole a shot like that on the 11th it keeps the momentum going
492202 what was really special was coming down the last eight with that great support teeing up so early compared with leaders we still had a huge crowd and it was very special coming up 18 i hope it will be like that tomorrow
492203 i was coasting at five under finishing 3 2 2 you cant argue with that its a good way to finish
492204 i got in this habit of playing golf for the wrong reasons
492205 i wasnt trying to play golf i was trying to make the cut i was afraid to hit a bad shot afraid of what people would think
492206 ive been hanging out with chris smith and chris anderson and they have been telling me hit that driver as hard as you can get over that fear this is the ryan i know these two days

492367 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
492368 religion is like a wasps nest you dont poke it with a stick unless you can run fast
492369 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
492370 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
492371 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
492372 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
492373 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
492374 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
492375 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
492376 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
492377 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact

492402 all of us have gotten it down to a routine schedule were working on getting things done quicker you know like hair and makeup because there are five girsl and four of the girls are in the first set so its hard to get everybody done but were doing really well

492410 whats interesting about it is not that crichton may be the only pop novelist writing google code but that he can weave it into a plot the mumbo jumbo is an excerpt from one of six fake google entries purporting to be about a rare disease called gandler kreukheim syndrome one of this books many contentions is that we are gullible enough to think that any scientific sounding data we read is true

492412 the evidence is right there in front of you mr levitt actually reproduces all the answer sheets from two classrooms and challenges you to spot the cheater then he shows you how it is done he points to suspicious patterns that you almost surely overlooked suspicious yes but not conclusive maybe there is some legitimate explanation except that mr levitt slowly piles pattern on pattern ruling out one explanation after another until only the most insidious one remains the resulting tour de force is so convincing that it eventually cost 12 he even provides you the opportunity to look over the raw data which is printed on the page you look it over and see no real pattern then on the next page he provides you the same set of data but with the answers highlighted and you can believe your eyes it is obvious that there was cheating he later goes to draw more conclusions from this data which you begin to pick holes in due to the numerous variables but he fires back

492476 as mayor of montgomery bobby bright has established an impeccable record of fiscal responsibility
492477 i am proud of my fiscally responsible record and extremely gratified by the blue dogs endorsement
492478 his dedication to fiscal responsibility during his time as mayor will translate well here in washington
492479 we need more conservative democrats in congress especially those who will be good stewards of taxpayers money
492480 everybody will work as hard as they can to make sure the democrats in washington dont get another ally with bobby bright
492481 jay knows me he goes to church with me i voted for him for the deacon board
492482 i hope he doesnt stay with that i would be very disappointed
492483 if not we do not need that kind of person with that kind of character in washington
492484 i dont want to be congressman if i have to tear somebody else down
492485 when someone tells you they are really a conservative but are still choosing to run as a democrat youve got to ask yourself what the cost will be to the 2nd congressional district
492486 if you think nancy pelosi and charlie rangel know whats best for our district then there will be a candidate in this race for you but he will not be coming out of the republican primary but if you want someone who will stand up and fight for our traditional alabama values then ive got a candidate for you
492487 that is an old political game that has been played successfully in the past
492488 i am dedicated to making a difference whether i go up there as a democrat or a republican or an independent
492489 i dont care where you are from or what you call yourself the facts are the facts you are known by the company you keep and who you choose to affiliate with
492490 if he wants to focus negatively on me and my party affiliation i truly believe people will send a strong message in november
492491 i want to stay focused on the issues because the people of district 2 deserve it
492492 people know me and people know jay now lets address the issues
492493 the algop and their congressional nominees are panicking and running from the bush cheney mccain budget deficit falling dollar record gas prices stock market decline and wars without end and know that they can ill afford to stand with vp cheney in dothan decatur or talladega to have a real unscripted dialogue with alabama voters
492494 to see the logistical planning on that scale and how efficient it is is phenomenal
492495 the size and scope and energy of the campaign is unprecedented
492496 he talked a lot about transition from dnc shop to presidential shop
492497 i think 100 percent of democratic leadership want to win more than they want to whine
492498 because they see it as an investment and they want results
492499 people lamented 10 to 15 years ago about tort hell in alabama
492500 its now consumer hell big corporations and big oil have bought control of the supreme court
492501 a typical response from democrats because thats the way they want to do business
492502 they remember the days when trial lawyers did business when alabama was tort hell
492503 i know that allegation was made in last years 2006 campaign but as far as i know exxon mobil does not make any contributions to candidates running for the supreme court in alabama
492504 some major corporations say they dont contribute but its almost impossible to disprove that
492505 since corporations are capped for direct contributions at 500 pac s are their way to flood money into a campaign
492506 im sure there may be some individuals that have connections to exxon mobil
492507 to the extent that it can be shown that republicans are responsible for the state of alabama getting less money than it would have gotten if it courts ruling had gone the other way it could be a good issue
492508 there is a perception in alabama that justice is for sale in this state
492509 that strikes at the very heart of the confidence level that alabamians have in the supreme court
492510 im sure were getting support from business and im very proud of it

492519 we do not talk about these things over the phone she is busy
492520 malaysia is a nation under apartheid albeit an updated version of it
492521 in one word its chinese taxes paying for malay development
492522 it is an offence a criminal offense for a malay to choose otherwise from being a muslim
492523 yuantao came out to me i had read a lot of gay themed books and movies by his recommendation besides he had also been a good boy in school and in the family he never made us worried
492524 always make sure your parents have some understanding and acceptance of homosexuality before coming out to them
492525 coming out to younger trustworthy members of the family first might also help
492526 just make sure youre well behaved and a good student
492527 can hopefully give you more credit when you try to convince your parents that you are gay and its fine
492528 if the parent child relationship hasnt been close then i dont think they should tell
492529 i am really glad seeing them together because mu is so happy when hes with him his sons boyfriend now it feels like i have two sons and i do hope the law will allow them to get married one day
492530 they should seek to find out what science says about homosexuality
492531 science can rid them of this unreasonable fear comfortable that my son is gay because i know being gay is not a crime or a disgrace
492532 i hesitated because here in this city guangzhou there are a lot people who know me and what would they think of me if they knew my son is gay but later i thought there was nothing wrong with my son to love boys i am his mother i am supposed to stand by him
492533 if i could turn back time i would never have married a woman
492534 even though my wife has forgiven me i cannot forgive myself and feel guilty all the time
492535 it had never crossed our mind that we were gay and also we had no idea how to define our behavior
492536 but i have missed him a lot over the years
492537 the more you try to oppress sex the more resistance will rise up
492538 they were not available in any shops only the birth control offices of stated owned companies had them and of course it was impossible for us to ask
492539 in the past it was right and proper to get married when people reached a certain age
492540 i thought she would be furious after i told her
492541 however she said that she had known it for a long time
492542 a lot of chinese gay men have had similar experiences
492543 my goal is to make a general report on chinese gay relationships
492544 by visiting foreign websites i realized that i was not the only gay man in the world
492545 i do care about being called a gay man in public therefore emails are safer for me
492546 i was shocked to see so many people there it seemed like a totally different world where people all looked so relaxed chatting and smiling
492547 i know many gay men dont dare to do it either because of social pressure
492548 we have to wait till someday when we are accepted
492549 no parent is able to accept such a fact thats always been true in china
492550 the pressure to marry increased dramatically after i graduated from university at the beginning i had to obey my parents wish to date the young men they chose for me
492551 both my parents believe that i have certain physiological problems
492552 they claim that it is a natural law for a woman to get married and give birth to a baby how can i be an exception
492553 understanding from your family is more important than that of the outside world because you have to face them everyday
492554 if they were willing to accept me i would be less depressed
492555 even if we were rich enough to buy a house would our parents allow us to live together
492556 it is my life and it is my right to choose the lifestyle i want
492557 and every year more and more gays come out of the closet in beijing and the big cities you can see couples walking around the shopping malls holding hands in the smaller cities i hear its getting better all the time
492558 i organized a gay film festival and the authorities warned us not to advertise the location and the date not even on the internet
492559 there are lots of education programs on safe sex and hiv prevention in gay communities and on the internet and there is also lots of funding available to safe sex campaigns
492560 if you do something wrong of course you can get into trouble but thats not just for gays thats true for all chinese other than that
492561 larry was not a second class citizen im not a second class citizen it is ok if you are gay
492562 larry was brave enough to bring high heels and makeup to school and he wasnt afraid of anything
492563 generally speaking governments in asia do not provide such rights for anybody straight or gay half of asia is still burdened by criminal law prohibitions
492564 i always felt that the girls in a family should get a little more than the boys even though all are equally loved
492565 they need a little cushion to fall back on women can stand on the empire state building and scream to the heavens that they are equal to men and liberated but until they have the same anatomy its a lie its more of a mans world today than ever men can eat their cake in unlimited bakeries
492566 dont stay on the phone for more than 10 minutes
492567 i think it behooves us to stop offering each other these pearls of feminism to stop saying so why dont you call him
492568 men like hunting and we shouldnt deprive them of their chance to do their hunting and mating rituals
492569 as my mom says men dont like to be chased
492570 as much as youre waiting for that little envelope to appear on your screen
492571 you happen to have a lot of stuff to do anyway
492572 what our grandmothers told us about playing hard to get is true the whole point of the game is to impress and capture its not about honesty many men and women when theyre playing the courtship game deceive so they can win novelty excitement and danger drive up dopamine in the brain and both sexes brag
492573 what i find most disturbing about the and retrogression of womens lives is that it has seeped into the corporate and social culture where it can do real damage
492574 otherwise intelligent men who know women still earn less than men as a rule say things like ill get the check
492575 its a scuzzy 70s thing like platform shoes on men
492576 paying is like opening a car door its nice i appreciate it but he doesnt have to
492577 they make like they are heading into their bag after a meal but vacation he looked askance
492578 one of the few remaining ways we can demonstrate our manhood
492579 i cant believe im 46 and not married men only want to marry their personal assistants or p r women

492705 it is with great sadness that ive had to see my accomplishment of finishing 17 th in the wsop main event clouded by slanderous accusations and inaccurate information i have been humbled by the overwhelming support from friends fans and the media and for their sake as well as mine i feel as if i must respond and bring clarity to the situation there is no denying the positive press and exposure i brought pokernews by wearing their logo and being their representative during the 2008 world series of poker main event after such a successful series i am greatly dismayed by pokernews subsequent actions no one has ever questioned my integrity before this and i am so distressed that pokernews is using their powerful public forum to spin such a negative recounting of the facts of what occurred during the final two days of the main event as we all know it is standard practice for players to wear multiple logos during the main event pokernews was aware of this having placed their logos on a number of players with sponsorship deals with other companies throughout the world series i saw several players wear the pokernews logo alongside the logos of online card rooms such as pokerstars and t6 this makes it very clear that pokernews supported this practice as a rule and were not against players wearing their logo in conjunction with the logo of an online card room like many other people i wore multiple logos but in no way diminished the presence of pokernews in doing so unfortunately in this instance pokernews suddenly felt that i was in violation of my backing deal by wearing another logo i have a written contract that has been reviewed by legal counsel and it is very clearly a non exclusive contract meaning that while i was expected to wear the pokernews logo i was in no way prevented from wearing any other logo furthermore pokernews did not possess any power to make advise or negotiate any kind of logo or sponsorship deal that came about via my playing the main event in light of recent allegations by pokernews i have had this contract reviewed again by legal counsel to reconfirm my stance that i in no way was in violation it was never even said to me verbally until after the fact that there was an expectation of exclusivity even in my previous dealings with pokernews as their on camera host i have made a point to never agree to any kind of exclusivity with their company as advised by my talent manager the first i heard of pokernews disapproval to me wearing the ub logo was after i already had it on and was playing on the featured table it was unfortunate that while i was working hard to try to win the main event and in so doing help to further promote pokernews i was chastised by pokernews representatives at all hours of the day and night for wearing a second logo despite my repeated requests that they go through my manager and let me just concentrate on playing they insisted on contacting me directly greatly upsetting me during the most important weekend of my life these representatives of pokernews kept repeatedly telling me they had nothing but my best interests at heart yet i felt bombarded by several parties trying to control my decisions and pressure my actions a fact that is known to pokernews is that i was approached by many online poker sites wanting me to represent them during the last few days of the event however i chose to work with ultimatebet tony g even quotes in his blog had been working on putting a deal together for tiff with pokerstars and they had just emailed me i knew tiff could become a huge star and i was going to allow her to do a deal that would protect pokernews also for the main event
492706 its my blog and i do not like to be brought down

492724 but if you present credible testimony of the actual murderer its hard to say someone would have found turner guilty
492725 my most anger has been toward billy brown he murdered an innocent young lady and sent me to prison and upset countless lives but im not so angry anymore i do still harbor some feeling toward the prosecutors but its not a hatred
492726 now with respect to defendant the state alleges that he purposely failed to appear at this trial in order to avoid conviction the question of whether defendant purposely failed to appear at this trial in order to avoid conviction is another question of fact for you to determine you should understand that mere absence from a trial doesnt in and of itself establish that the defendant purposely failed to appear in order to avoid conviction if you find that the defendant fearing that he would be convicted of the charges contained in the indictment purposely failed to appear at this trial then you may consider whether his failure to appear together with all the other evidence in this case is an indication or any proof of his consciousness of guilt but keep in mind that failure to appear may only be considered as evidence of consciousness of guilt if you determine that the defendants purpose in failing to appear was to avoid conviction for the offenses charged in the indictment and not for any other purpose it is for you to decide whether or not the evidence of failure to appear shows a consciousness of guilt and the weight to be given to such evidence in light of all the other evidence in the case

492833 zo zegt vers 62 5 niet dat joden ezels zijn het vergelijkt alleen de ongelovige joden met ezels die een te zware last dragen een dergelijke verwarring tussen beweringen en vergelijkingen zou je zelfs van een middelbare scholier niet toelaten

492951 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
492952 i think its important for the american people to understand were not going to drill our way out of this problem
492953 its also important to recognize if you start drilling now you wont see a drop of oil for ten years which means its not going to have a significant impact on short term prices every expert agrees on that
492954 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling

492974 mas buo at dinamiko na mga programa at polisiyang dinisenyo para mapababa ang antas ng kahirapan at bulnerabilidad sa pamamagitan ng pagkakapantay pantay at seguridad
492975 kung magkagipitan at inutusan siya neri ng palasyo na maglabas ng pera ng sss para sa isang proyekto na hindi naman para sa sss members makakatanggi ba siya
492976 may limitasyon ang paggamit ng pondo hindi ito maaaring gamitin sa maka mahihirap na proyekto ng gobyerno
492977 kung para sa koordinasyon nariyan na ang ibat ibang inter agency committee gaya ng national anti poverty commission at social development committee ng neda
492978 kung tunay na nagmamalasakit si arroyo sa mahihirap bakit hindi pamunuan ng dswd ang mga programa para sa kanila o dagdagan na lamang ang pondo ng ahensiya kami naman ang may karanasan sa ganyan bakit kailangang magtayo ng isa pang antas sa burukrasya
492979 nakakapanghinayang na nasasayang ang mga rekurso ng gobyerno sa mga pamigay na para sa kakaunti lamang at nagagamit pa sa pulitika
492980 ito ay panloloko lang upang mapagtakpan ang kanyang arroyo malalaking pananagutan sa aming mga maralita masahol pa tiyak na magiging balon ito korupsiyon lalunat papalapit na ang 2010 halalan
492981 ipinapakita nito na napupunta sa malakanyang ang katas ng vat at hindi sa publiko
492982 ibig sabihin kumita pa ang gobyerno kaya hindi nito ibinababa ang presyo ng gamot
492983 walang rekord si pangulong arroyo ng pagbangga sa pagkakamal ng tubo ng multinasyunal na mga kompanya ng gamot pinayagan niya ito sa nakaraang pitong taon ano ang magagawa niya ngayon
492984 sabi ni karen jamora tagapagsalita ng health science students act now
492985 kung wala kang doktor sino ang magrereseta ng gamot sino ang magbibigay ng serbisyong pangkalusugan
492986 kalagayan ng kumpletong pisikal mental at sosyal na kapakanan hindi lamang ang kawalan ng sakit
492987 sa ilalim globalisasyon at neo liberal na polisiyang pang ekonomiya salaula ang kapakanan ng mga mamamayan at naglipana ang sakit ang mayroon lamang buhay na pinagkaitan ng dignidad at batayang mga pangangailangan
492988 sa harapan ko mismo ay nakita ko na pinapipirma ng bantay na militar sina rose at fatima sa isang papel na nagsasaad na sila ay hindi dinukot at kusang loob na pumunta sa kanila sa kabila ng takot at kahit nag iiyak hindi pumirma sina fatima at rose ann
492989 malapit si rose ann sa tatay niya nagrebelde yung kanyang kalooban nang pinatay yung tatay niya na hindi naman masamang tao at napakabait pinatay nang wala namang dahilan yun na nga ang nakapagtataka doon sundalo ang pumatay sa tatay nila tapos ngayon sasabihin na sa kanila humingi ng tulong ganun naman talaga yung militar binabaliktad ang kuwento dahil hawak nila
492990 kinapkapan ako hinatak pababa ang aking pantalon at panty pati ang aking puwet ay tiningnan ng stethoscope at tinusok tusok ng stick ang aking hita ng doktor na hindi nagpakilala
492991 bawat salita ni fatima nakatingin sa sundalo tapos yung sundalo ang sumasagot kahit hindi naman siya yung tinatanong ko sinasabi niyang ayaw talaga nanay sumama ni fatima sa iyo samantalang di naman nagsasalita ang bata kaya yun ang hinala ko na tinatakot si fatima
492992 yung ikaw lang ay magpahayag ipaglaban mo ang karapatan mo bilang magsasaka sa lupa pinagbintangan na nila na npa ang asawa ko hanggang sa mawala na siya hanggang ngayon malaki yung epekto sa amin ng pangyayari nasusundan pa rin kami kahit saang lugar kami magtago
492993 si rose ann maaalalahanin sa magulang at sa mga kapatid ganoon din si fatima siya yung tumutulong sa akin noong hindi pa ako nag aasawa ulit
492994 sosonahin daw yung aming lugar tapos talagang hinahanap na talaga ako kung hindi ako umalis doon baka ako na yung hinawakan ng mga sundalo para lang sumulpot ang aking mga anak na basta ang alam ko nasa pampanga
492995 ang mga batang naiipit sa digmaang sibil at dapat iginagalang ang mga karapatan
492996 dapat kagyat at walang kondisyong pakawalan si fatima ng afp wala siyang kaso at di dapat hinahawakan ng militar kung totoo ngang may sakit siya lalo niyang kailangan ang kalinga ng kanyang ina
492997 anong moral ground ng afp para sabihing inaalala nila ang kapakanan ng magkapatid
492998 sobrang mapagbintang sila sa mga sibilyan na wala namang kasalanan di na lang nila hanapin yung tunay nilang kalaban kundi sibilyan yung mas higit na naaapektuhan hindi pa nga nabigyan ng katarungan yung asawa ko tapos yan na naman

493001 mas pinahalagahan ng gobyerno ang mga transnasyunal na kompanya kaya humantong tayo sa ganitong problema
493002 hindi makokontrol ang pagkalat ng kemikal kapag napakawalan ito sa karagatan agad na ikamamatay nito ang mga lamang dagat na siya ring pangunahing kabuhayan ng mga residente sa probinsiya
493003 isa pa nga ang gobyerno ng pilipinas sa mga nagtutulak na maisama ito noong unang bahagi ng dekada 90 pero bigla na lamang ito nawalan ng interes malakas din kasi ang impluwensiya ng hoechst sa mga internasyunal na pulong hinggil sa pops
493004 nananawagan kami kay pang arroyo na kagyat na ipagbawal ang lahat ng nakakalasong mga kemikal dapat ding gumawa at ipatupad ng gobyerno ang mahigpit na mga panuntunan sa importasyon distribusyon at paggamit ng pestisidyo sa bansa
493005 nararapat na hati ng mga manggagawa sa paglikha ng yaman at pagpapatakbo ng ekonomiya
493006 sana madagdagan pa ang bilang ng mga mamamayang pilipino na nagtutulak sa batas na nagtataas ng sahod sinasabi ng malakanyang na ang mga manggagawa ang gumagawa ng yaman ng bansa pero lagi nitong hinuhuli ang kapakanan ng mga manggagawa
493007 bakit ang mga manggagawa kailangan pang tumakbo sa senado at sa kamara kailangan pang mag hearing at ng maraming debate para sa p125 samantalang paggising natin walang kaabog abog nagtaas na ang presyo ng langis
493008 iisa lang naman ang bituka ng mga manggagawa saan mang bahagi ng bansa
493009 kung mayroon lang talagang nakabubuhay na sahod dito at disenteng trabaho hindi kami aalis ng bansa
493010 hindi maaalis sa mga migrante na siya ay uring manggagawa
493011 hindi na kailangan pa ang katakut takot na datos para makitang kailangan ang dagdag na sahod
493012 hindi ito simpleng umento kundi paggiit ng katarungang panlipunan pagkilala ito sa mga manggagawa di lamang bilang manggagawa kundi bilang tao
493013 optimistiko kami na mailalaban namin ito dahil ang dating sektoral na isyu ay naging multi sektoral na makikita mo naman nandito ang lahat para suportahan ang laban ng mga manggagawa

493028 we have very good evidence of links between osama bin laden al qaeda operatives and what happened on september 11
493029 proof had to be delivered that the september 11 terror attack came from abroad
493030 i have seen absolutely powerful and incontrovertible evidence of his osama bin ladens link to the events of the 11th of september
493031 there is no evidence presented in the dossier that directly links bin laden to september 11
493032 there was no doubt of bin ladens responsibility for the september 11 attacks before the tape was discovered
493033 the american translators who listened to the tapes and transcribed them apparently wrote a lot of things in that they wanted to hear but that cannot be heard on the tape no matter how many times you listen to it
493034 the reason why 9 11 is not mentioned on osama bin ladens most wanted page is because the fbi has no hard evidence connecting bin laden to 9 11
493035 bin laden has not been formally charged in connection with 9 11
493036 the fbi gathers evidence once evidence is gathered it is turned over to the department of justice the department of justice then decides whether it has enough evidence to present to a federal grand jury in the case of the 1998 united states embassies being bombed bin laden has been formally indicted and charged by a grand jury he has not been formally indicted and charged in connection with 9 11 because the fbi has no hard evidence connecting bin laden to 9 11
493037 we havent heard much from him i e bin laden and i wouldnt necessarily say hes at the center of any command structure and again i dont know where he is i ill repeat what i said i truly am not that concerned about him
493038 a cautionary tale about rushing to judgement in attributing responsibility for a terrorist act

493041 the 9 11 commission failed to recognize the sustained comprehensive efforts conducted by the intelligence community prior to 9 11 to penetrate the al qaeda organization

493044 what went wrong the c i a and the failure of american intelligence
493045 the great conspiracy the 9 11 news special you never saw
493046 i was not involved in the september 11 attacks in the united states nor did i have knowledge of the attacks there exists a government within a government within the united states the united states should try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself to the people who want to make the present century a century of conflict between islam and christianity that secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks the american system is totally in the control of the jews whose first priority is israel not the united states i have already said that we are not hostile to the united states we are against the system which makes other nations slaves of the united states or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom

493071 but if you present credible testimony of the actual murderer its hard to say someone would have found turner guilty
493072 my most anger has been toward billy brown he murdered an innocent young lady and sent me to prison and upset countless lives but im not so angry anymore i do still harbor some feeling toward the prosecutors but its not a hatred

493086 caesar is said to have been tall with a fair complexion shapely limbs a rather full face and keen black eyes and to have had sound health except that towards the end of his life he was subject to sudden fainting fits as well as nightmares he also had two attacks of epilepsy while on campaign he was fastidious in the care of his person and so not only kept his hair carefully trimmed and shaved but even had his body hair plucked he was extremely vexed by the disfiguring effects of his baldness since he found it exposed him to the ridicule of his opponents as a result he used to comb his receding hair forward from the crown of his head and of all the honours voted him by the senate and people there was none that pleased him more or that he made use of more gladly than the privilege of wearing a laurel wreath on all occasions they say too that his dress was unusual his purple striped tunic had fringe sleeves down to the wrist and he always wore a belt over it although it was loosely fastened this it is said was the reason for sullas frequent warning to the optimates to beware of the loose belted boy

493218 instead of just doing jiu jitsu or just doing wrestling just doing sparring i want to do more specific things ive got to evolve
493219 i think he had a really good game plan i think my two losses were to pretty good game plans
493220 i feel like i can perform better than that but i had a good time out there i cant wait to do it again i definitely want to fight him as a fighter i dont know about the business aspect but i do want to fight him again friend or no friend
493221 ive got to practice those transitions and get that flow going
493222 i felt like i was tough in my top jiu jitsu game but i didnt get a chance to use it because i didnt put him on his back i didnt practice chasing the guy down and setting up the takedown with punches thats what got me there so i need to go back to it
493223 jake shields and i kind of train ourself sometimes cesar gracie helps us too but were in san francisco
493224 if you saw joshs corner he had like four guys or three guys really taking care of him jiu jitsu muay thai coach javier mendez and theyre real professional out there thats another thing i want to do is maybe get a real cornerman
493225 im not happy about the loss i still have a big long future and i plan on becoming one of the best fighters out there it will take some time a little regroup and improve some skills and i think ill be ready
493226 from what happened in his last start its kind of hard to feel as confident as i was for the derby and those other races
493227 but i feel as confident as i can be that hes going to run his race
493228 im still kind of concerned about whats going to happen sunday because i know the horse went into the belmont in very good condition and whatever happened in that race i have no idea
493229 but if it happens again then im going to know something is wrong with just not going to run anymore stuff like that you know
493230 big brown is the story and rightfully so and we hope our horses come to play and see what happens
493231 it just didnt come to me you know im just not on top of things like that i guess i should have said something to mike its just so unimportant to me i just dont get it
493232 he could be better than the big brown leading up to the kentucky derby
493233 we are very excited to see him come into the race the right way we could not be happier with the way he is doing i think he is a horse that has captured the imagination of racing and to see him perform so poorly in the belmont was so disappointing to the horse
493234 we as a team were some of the only ones who felt that wasnt a fluke in 06
493235 i told them its really cool its neat to be ranked but theres a danger there obviously
493236 the danger is that players start chalking up a good season before youve played the first game and thats certainly not what you want
493237 when i first got here the vibe around the team and community was oh just get close
493238 if we finished close and played a hard game they were satisfied here but now were expected to win thats how we practice here thats how our coaches coach thats the type of pressure our fans put on us here
493239 i think in previous years they were content with a 5 6 season or a 4 7 season
493240 it kind of lost the drive on the team to go out and dominate
493241 somebody may have sent something i dont even know how to send a text message

493391 the man named his wife eve because she was the mother of all the living and the lord god made garments of skins for adam and his wife and clothed them
493392 so the lord god cast a deep sleep upon the man and while he slept he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh to the spot and the lord god fashioned the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman and he brought her to the man the the man said this one at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh this one shall be called woman for from man was she taken

493488 there is no mixture of the two systems possible there is no such thing as a mixed economy a system that would be in part capitalistic and in part socialist
493489 even the most primitive husbandmen are dimly aware of the consequences of acts which to a modern accountant would appear as capital consumption
493490 the concept of capital cannot be separated from the context of monetary calculation and from the social structure of a market economy in which alone monetary calculation is possible
493491 in a socialist economy there are capital goods but no capital the notion of capital makes sense only in the market economy it is not a category of all acting it is a category of acting within a market economy
493492 if historical experience could teach us anything it would be that private property is inextricably linked with civilization
493493 the psychological problem of why people scorn and disparage capitalism and call everything they dislike capitalistic and everything they praise socialistic concerns history and must be left to the historians
493494 entrepreneurs grown old and tired and the decadent heirs of people who succeeded in the past dislike the agile parvenus who challenge their wealth and their eminent social position
493495 the consumers not the entrepreneurs pay ultimately the wages earned by every worker the glamorous movie star as well as the charwoman
493496 even messenger boys know that the boss runs things around the shop but it requires a little more brains to notice the entrepreneurs dependence on the market
493497 to assign to everybody his proper place in society is the task of the consumers their buying and abstention from buying is instrumental in determining each individuals social position

493509 it takes awhile to get comfortable as a receiver in this league
493510 as far as knowing the game route running im still learning
493511 the last two or three years im just getting to know all that
493512 very seldom does a receiver come in and make a big impact their first year
493513 a few do but those are special guys most of the time you come in and you learn because youve got to read defenses youve got to learn a new offense once you get familiar with the offense and the calls and get used to the quarterback and his throws and he gets to know you after about two years that third year you see a lot of guys flourish
493514 as much as weve been around each other it took us time to get a feel for each other to get confidence and timing down last year we clicked at the right time
493515 you start to get a feel for a guy where to put it where he likes it
493516 foreclosures impact not only those at risk of losing their homes but every middle class homeowner who relies on their home equity as a means of building wealth congress has taken a good first step towards addressing this crisis but there is work yet to be done as minnesotas senator ill work with congressman ellison to save our communities from the foreclosure spiral help responsible homeowners save their homes and crack down on the predatory lenders who contributed to the problem in the first place george w bush and norm coleman have stood with the special interests instead of helping minnesotans and come november we will change that

493553 the iphone is central to what he sees as an ongoing transformation of at amp t his goal turn the iconic company into a wireless goliath with global reach and intense customer loyalty
493554 the iphone has repositioned at amp t as the premier wireless brand in the world
493555 the iphone might seem like a no brainer now but back then it was little more than a concept with no name design plan or software operating system and it was offered by a computer company that had zip experience in wireless
493556 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
493557 it looks as though the population believes climate change is serious and there seems to be momentum behind the issue and there are some people who dont like that
493558 there are still plenty of creationists around and there are people who believe tobacco is not linked to serious health effects and so there are still people who choose to ignore or doubt the amount of evidence for climate change
493559 we would kill literally kill for a good paper that proved the science on global warming was wrong
493560 then i could retire and accept my chair at harvard unfortunately thats not going to happen and theres vast amounts of evidence why
493561 with a final lap of the incoming tide the governments fictitious energy policy is being washed away like a late summer sandcastle
493562 we were at point where it seemed the government had finally got the message and was implementing policies to reduce emissions and suddenly oil prices shot up and suddenly the government caved in over taxes on petrol
493563 offensively we scored 55 touchdowns last year 54 of those touchdowns are back
493564 defensively we made great strides in the spring i think we can build on that with the depth were getting on that side of the football but i think the biggest gains we are going to make this year is going to be on special teams with these numbers and the players we do have we have competition at the field goal position we have competition for kickoffs we have competition for punting competition makes you better if we focus on effort and we show up every day and practice and play with tremendous passion the sky is the limit for this ball club
493565 hopefully you will not see him on defense but if we needed him over there we sure would use him there if we can keep people healthy he will be a slotback most of the time he will still be a short yardage back for us but we are going to try to focus him most of the time on his role at none position but he will do other things for us
493566 i think what excites me most is just the continuity in this entire football team and this coaching staff we can not watch them in the summer but they come to the office every day and they tell you how hard they have worked and what they are doing there is such a good feeling right now and there is just a tremendous amount of chemistry with this football team right now i think a lot of that as i said earlier is because of the great senior class we have
493567 were excited to go play an sec opponent in vanderbilt and then we have both army and north texas coming here i think it is a good schedule one that fits rice better than what we have had in the past
493568 we know how fast he is and we are thrilled he is here when it comes to a freshman what we are going to do is make sure that he is ready to handle college football that will be a day to day observation if he is not ready he will not be out there but if he is then you will see him out there as a freshman
493569 ill be a much better head coach here in than in year one because i know what this team is capable of doing now i know i look back and reflect back on some of the decisions i made last year even offensively when we lined up in power sets to play power football that is not who we are i know what the strengths of this football team are and those are what we will rely on this year thats what makes it so exciting we have so many seniors back i said back in spring that we got better we will get better when we practice tonight because of the continuity and staff continuity we have in this football team we are going to get better every day
493570 you know its amazing last year he only caught 79 passes and i had to hear what a bad year he had we are going to be smart enough that when he is open to throw it to him because he is a very talented young man
493571 because we are going into our first practice tonight it would be purely speculation like shane turner i think shane can help us but i want to make sure before i make any bold statements on who is out there and i dont want to leave any one out but i think you will see freshmen in the lineup this year some of them are big and physically ready to go right now and i think they will have to help

493582 per le donne la vita sempre stata dura in questo paese ma forse ora con il governo comunista sono pi libere ed hanno pi diritti di quanti non abbiano mai avuto
493583 le libert e le opportunit di cui avevano goduto le donne tra il 1972 ed il 1992 appartenevano al passato

493588 il mullah faizullah aveva confessato a miriam che a volte lui stesso non capiva il significato della parole del corano ma aggiungeva che quando le parole arabegli uscivano dalla bocca il loro suono loa ffascinava gli davano conforto gli alleggerivano il cuore

493597 she was just being nice to you by giving you some food

493599 i think she probably went down head first and landed on her back
493600 i wasnt expecting anybody alive at the bottom of the shaft so i was shocked

493610 if a service tax is implemented how many seniors will no longer be able to afford basic care services they require to live in their homes
493611 communities must make a commitment to ease the way for this population group
493612 she was in a good nursing home but she is much happier now that she is home she was miserable because she missed her own surroundings and living life at her pace in her own privacy
493613 but it wouldnt be possible without her having in home care from home instead senior care
493614 she wants to stay there but it is becoming a financial burden
493615 she is going to run out of money and a tax like this would only deplete her savings faster
493616 we would have to scale back the hours she has a caregiver in her home the equivalent of three or four weeks
493617 and we cant do that so my guess is that we would have to find other arrangements for her possibly even in another state
493618 to my love after 25 long years of marriage enjoy your gift it is very fast just as you demanded last time i checked it goes from zero to 210 in less than six seconds

493623 the dignity funeral home group has joined us as a key sponsor and through their generous donation we will be able to run a smoother operation this year
493624 during my mission work in mexico from 1994 to 1998 i worked daily with families and found that i had a great affinity to help seniors a simple dinner would turn into hours as i listened to them talk about their lives and their children upon returning to michigan and my home town of bloomfield hills my search for a franchise that embodied the core values of respect and dignity led me to home instead with home instead senior care i found a new mission keeping the dreams of seniors alive by keeping them at home

493682 the thing that we are trying to stress is how we have to be viewed as a football team if its hot we want it hotter if i am tired i want to be more tired if i am hurt a little bit let me have something else hurt because whatever we are dealt we have to overcome thats the type of football team we have to be and thats the personality we have to have thats the thing our players are getting to and thats the thing we are getting to as a staff we have to be a tough minded football team
493683 i guess its warm and they need water our guys are in great shape thats just the way the world works if you get 105 people out here you are going to have one or two cramps
493684 we werent quite as sharp as what we would like to be but when you are in shorts and a t shirt and you are not running the football because you dont want to risk somebody getting hit then it can get a little unclean
493685 defensively i think jason smith plays with great tenacity and great effort and is always going to be right up there i am pretty pleased with the way our running backs are seeing the holes their vision has been pretty good for the limited amount of time that we are running the ball right now ray sims is a talented guy who has great feet and soft hands so he brings something different to the table

493687 so simple and sooo delicious if u dont have anything at home for a snack just mix the walnuts pop them in the oven and there u have it everybody was asking me for the sugared nut recipe but most of all my 6 year old son and my husband loved it
493688 we will be having a staff meeting at 10 00 this morning in the conference room i will introduce you to everybody then
493689 i am sorry sir but that wont work for me
493690 i am planning on leaving the office around 9 30 this morning to go fishing with some friends you know what they say it is not the quantity but the quality of time that matters i wont be spending much time in the office while i am working for you but i assure you the time i spend will be high quality
493691 there might be some logic to this but dont sit there and just stonewall
493692 ran over agent aguilar in a hummer as he was placing spike strips on the road
493693 because there were no charges or extradition proceedings against him in the u s

493695 if i couldnt go to a tap and get a drink of water i dont know what id do
493696 big city water in this country is absolutely fine but the problem with assuring safe potable water is it takes a minimum degree of microbiological knowledge engineering skill and a supporting infrastructure
493697 doing that requires you have a large enough customer base so you can afford the high quality relatively expensive services
493698 ontario is a paragon of sanity compared to british columbia where you have a third of the population and 4 000 water suppliers
493699 every small town every little place has its own jealously guarded water systems most of which have inadequate treatment
493700 the real problem with canadian drinking water quality is we have far too many rinky dink suppliers and theyre too small to produce the level of safety that our society seems to demand
493701 they can have effects on reproduction some pharmaceuticals estrogens testosterone some pesticides
493702 the endocrine system is the one that produces hormones it is very very sensitive and there are chemicals in the water that influence the endocrine system of fish
493703 i think the reproductive effects are potentially important and we do hear about human fertility issues sperm count in males decreasing problems with learning difficulties in children allergies asthma cancers there are so many things we dont have an explanation for
493704 those systems will catch quite a few numbers of nasties like oils and very complex large chain molecules like pcbs
493705 they dont do well at all with these endocrine disruptors
493706 most pesticides and fertilizers that get into our streams and rivers never pass through a sewage treatment plant
493707 what if we manage the dams in the mountains in a different way
493708 what if we held the water in there instead of opening it up at different times in the year and ran it off in june and july when the water is low
493709 right now there are large water users such as agriculture so agriculture right now is like the water bank
493710 theres a real problem with drawing on that water bank because water is food
493711 if you draw down on that water bank and take food out of the system where are we
493712 i think we still have time to fix things all we need to do is change the way we are thinking about water and what we put into water

493729 while these increases have not for the most part been passed on at the retail level it is inevitable that they will be at some point
493730 car dealers and other retailers cannot continue to absorb rising costs at the wholesale level and not pass some of these increases on to consumers
493731 well supported with facts in terms of why the company needs them
493732 our customers to the best of their ability are passing them on
493733 but they recognize that their own private label costs are going up and theyve accepted it
493734 we have seen inflation and we have passed some of that through
493735 we have wherever possible worked with our suppliers to reduce the inflationary impact as much as possible
493736 i think the consumer is just starting to see not only with us rising commodity costs and rising general merchandise costs in a much bigger way then theyve seen other than with gasoline itself
493737 the reality is that the rapid run up in commodity costs has outpaced our ability to offset inflation in the near term with price increases and other actions

493743 rumor has it that the mccain folks there are clearing sections and pushing the crowd around so it looks more full what happened to the rpof spin that they were making it free because they found a sponsor
493744 i hear it is like 600 people in a county with 170 000 residents also in one of the most republican areas in the state in 2004 george bush appearing with mccain had 23 000 people show up

493757 si el plan es simplemente m s de lo mismo y m s millones de d lares que pertenecen a todos los chilenos tirados a un pozo sin fondo ese camino no conduce a ninguna parte
493758 queremos que el transantiago se solucione y eso es evidente pero que el ministro nos escuche nosotros hace tres meses atr s dimos 10 condiciones bueno las vamos a volver a plantear

493767 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
493768 lifting the ban would create new opportunities for american workers and businessmen
493769 a proposal presented friday by a bipartisan group of 10 senators five from each party would allow oil and gas drilling beyond 50 miles of the coast in the south atlantic and eastern gulf of mexico but leave the ban in place elsewhere bush also urged congress to end restrictions on developing shale oil on federal lands in the west and to allow drilling in alaskas arctic national wildlife refuge
493770 if at first you dont succeed try again verily those that give up will find themselves in a pitiful situation very soon in this life and in the afterlife
493771 the prophet p b u h said that it is forbidden for pious muslims to use the internet because it will be their guide to hell
493772 the prophet p b u h used to wear sandals and i am upholding his
493773 if muhammad had adidas sneakers he would probably have worn those
493774 so after asking that question some muslims the retarded ones go on and put that in practice the problem being that they take things very literally and think that they still live 1400 years ago you can be sure that if muhammad had been alive hed be making fun of these people
493775 it has been predicted by the prophet muhammad that the turks will be in posession of istanbul for 500 years and thereafter they will lose it to the christians when this happens so when the bulgarians take the city it is the duty of every pious muslim to kill as many christians as they can

493780 iraqi journalists like mashhadani play a vital role in telling this story to the world
493781 we were concerned to hear of mashhadanis detention and urge the u s military to disclose as a matter of urgency the grounds on which he is being held and what charges if any he faces
493782 he is being detained because he has been assessed to be a threat to the security of iraq and coalition forces
493783 he loved expensive cigars i know he loved pens watches

493788 lifting the ban would create new opportunities for american workers and businessmen
493789 but the leaders of the democratic congress have refused to allow a vote
493790 the president knows that the impact of any new drilling will be insignificant promising savings of only pennies per gallon many years down the road
493791 u s sen barack obama said today he would be willing to open floridas coast for more oil drilling if it meant winning approval for broad energy changes
493792 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
493793 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

493861 this is the ninth presidential campaign ive covered i cant remember a more scurrilous statement by a major party candidate it smacks of desperation it renews questions about whether mccain has the right temperament for the presidency
493862 john mccain stood up against george bush and don rumsfeld in the prosecution of the iraq war for many years
493863 ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush
493864 id like to start out by giving you a little straight talk under the present setup because weve mortgaged our childrens futures you will not have social security benefits that present day retirees have unless we fix it and americans have got to understand that americans have got to understand that we are paying present day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in america today emphasis added and thats a disgrace its an absolute disgrace and its gotta be fixed
493865 getting out of iraq will require just as much resolution as it took to get in and the same kind of resolution a willingness to ignore the consequences

493889 right around christmastime i was sitting in a parking lot
493890 and i felt like i just couldnt get out of the car it was like
493891 she laughs sadly pressing her ringless hands to her cheeks
493892 and i thought okay half of the parking lot has dealt with this more than half of the parking lot has dealt with this okay lets make it a little bigger half of this
493893 theres this moment in walk the line where june carter says i was never very aware of how much i was seen i was very aware of how much i was seen it was this moment of self discovery and loss of identity and who was stepping out of the car you know who is that person
493894 it came from staring into a bowl of ice cream one day
493895 im a chocolate lover but id rather look at it than eat it
493896 i think there is a movement around looking at all the products that are available this global stream of stuff and realizing you can tinker with them and rebuild them
493897 its all about not accepting whats presented for sale as it is
493898 about not just doing a paint by numbers of your life
493899 stems from a reflection on the eternal return of the old as a recurrent tendency of the market
493900 therefore let us make a provocation what better way to sell a vintage chair than to borrow a walking stick stereotype of the old to replace a leg of a classic stereotyped ikea chair
493901 very interesting big container rich with ingenious and original ideas
493902 i think ikea just makes it easy to d i y because it already has a system in place of mixing and matching this frame with that cabinet and those knobs hacking just takes it a little further repurposing it to fit your needs and maybe the geek nerd in us hackers feels a buzz having outsmarted the ikea system by creating something of our own
493903 there is a long history of hacking industrial artifacts or found objects and turning them into high design
493904 but to my knowledge ikea is the only company that is appealing to the do it yourselfer
493905 is this invisible aura of ikea something in our dna that is inviting and unspoken
493906 i can tell you were a culture thats asked to challenge conformity to speak outside the box
493907 customization is so huge for a demographic thats skewing younger and younger
493908 they dont want to be told by the man what they should consume and how exactly they should consume it thats boring they can make their own playlist they can take a product and make it truly their own
493909 like editing their own movies and photos on their computers blogging creating their own web sites
493910 so there is this yearning for things that are hands on and handmade

494109 la expedici n estaba compuesta por 18 alpinistas de lo que s lo cinco o seis han regresado al campo 4
494110 en este momento es dif cil hacer de manera exacta la cuenta de los desaparecidos
494111 vamos a ganar pero si no se puede y traemos un punto es bien recibido es un rival dif cil pero vamos con la idea de conseguir nuestro segundo triunfo
494112 muchos creo que todav a estamos arrancado no estamos al cien por ciento afinamos esta semana detalles en los que fallamos con necaxa para que no nos pase ahora contra santos
494113 sabemos c mo juega santos sus hombres importantes y que ellos van a jugar al frente all en torre n nosotros debemos hacer nuestro partido aguantar bien el cero y tratar de buscar los goles
494114 ya pensamos en la copa uefa y en el real madrid
494115 ganarle al madrid siempre es dif cil para nosotros o cualquier equipo espa ol a partir de ah es verdad que desde el a o 91 no han ganado en la coru a y eso es buena noticia para todo el deportivismo y eso es una ventaja quieras o no cuando antes se juegue es mejor
494116 ese equipo viene de un pa s como croacia que estuvo en la eurocopa y eso no nos debemos olvidar hemos tenido mala suerte en el sorteo ahora vamos a ver lo que significa como est n y es evidente que nosotros representamos al f tbol espa ol y no debemos asustarnos de jugar sea ante alemanes en este caso croatas o ingleses
494117 para pasar la eliminatoria tememos el segundo partido fuera de casa es un peque o problema sobre todo por una afici n como la croata que aprieta mucho pero estamos ilusionados con este torneo
494118 queremos hacer un buen partido ante el mar timo queremos una mejora individual y colectiva pensando en s en la uefa y pensar en el futuro con los jugadores de peso

494126 dado que la alineaci n del equipo ya ha sido difundida parece que mis deseos no ser n satisfechos
494127 cuando tienes un jugador m s piensas que f cilmente vas a ganar el partido y el equipo se conf o y empez a perder movilidad a perder intensidad
494128 tecos fue inteligente para manejar al partido fue inteligente para estar con 10 jugadores y la derrota es merecida
494129 al perder intensidad se va a perder el control del partido cuando el equipo pierde intensidad pierde concentraci n no fue el mismo equipo contra cruz azul
494130 con la expulsi n empezamos a perder el partido ya en ese momento el equipo emocionalmente ya no estaba jugando igual perdimos intensidad y creo que el rbitro perdi esa capacidad neutral le falt personalidad entr al ritmo que quer a tecos
494131 quer amos retener al futbolista del a o en alemania

494320 when you go into a room just for fun look straight ahead dont look around at anything but be aware of everything in the room see the shapes the colors the people and the furniture everything without looking at it dont move your eyes
494321 cant the student attend to both the bird outside and the mathematics lesson
494322 if you totally attend with our ears with your eyes with your body with your nerves with all your mind with your heart in the sense of affection love compassion total attention what takes place
494323 what do you think is the greatest the supreme art
494324 when there is concentration which is a process of exclusion there is a resistance and therefore a contradiction but when there is attention there is no contradiction because an attentive mind can concentrate without exclusion
494325 what is observation you observe through the eye dont you now can you observe without moving the eye because if you move the eye the whole operation of the thinking brain comes into being i wont go into this because youll turn it into some kind of mystical nonsensical thing mysterious and you know all the rest of that and in inquiring can you observe without any movement of the eye because the eye has an effect on the brain
494326 but on the other hand you can do nothing and meditate in the bus or when you are driving it is the most extraordinary thing that you can meditate while you are driving be careful i mean this the body has its own intelligence which thought has destroyed
494327 meditation can however take place when the eyes are open and one is surrounded by objects of every kind but then these objects have no importance at all one sees them but there is no process of recognition which means there is no experiencing
494328 the trees mountains rivers clouds sunlight birds and flowers that he describes over and over again are forever new because they are seen each time with eyes that have never become accustomed to them each day they are a totally fresh perception for him and so they become for us
494329 early in the morning when the sun was not yet up and the dew on the grass still in bed lying quietly without any thought or movement there was a seeing not the superficial seeing with the eyes but seeing through the eyes from behind the head the eyes and from behind the head were only the instrument through which the immeasurable past was seeing into the immeasurable space that had no time
494330 there is no division between the world and you you are the world
494331 our looking is as bound by time space as our brain we never look we never see beyond this limitation we do not know how to look through and beyond these fragmentary frontiers but eyes have to see beyond them penetrating deeply and widely without choosing without shelter they have to wander beyond man made frontiers of ideas and values and to feel beyond love
494332 is it that we are so caught up in our own network of problems our own desires our own urges of pleasure and pain that we never look around never watch the moon watch it watch with all your eyes and ears your sense of smell watch look as though you are looking for the first time if you can do that that tree that bush that blade of grass you are seeing for the first time then you can see your teacher your mother and father your brother and sister for the first time there is an extraordinary feeling about that the wonder the strangeness the miracle of a fresh morning that has never been before never will be be really in communion with nature not verbally caught in description of it but be a part of it be aware feel that you belong to all that be able to have love for all that to admire a deer the lizard on the wall that broken branch lying on the ground look at the evening star the new moon without the word without merely saying how beautiful it is and turning your back on it attracted by something else but watch that single star and new delicate moon as though for the first time if there is such a communion between you and nature then you can commune with man with the boy sitting next to you with your educator or with your parents we have lost all sense of relationship in which there is not only a verbal statement of affection and concern but also this sense of communion which is not verbal it is a sense that we are all together that we are all human beings we are all living on this extraordinary beautiful earth

494335 the possibility that we are living in a false vacuum has never been a cheering one to contemplate vacuum decay is the ultimate ecological catastrophe in the new vacuum there are new constants of nature after vacuum decay not only is life as we know it impossible so is chemistry as we know it however one could always draw stoic comfort from the possibility that perhaps in the course of time the new vacuum would sustain if not life as we know it at least some structures capable of knowing joy this possibility has now been eliminated

494346 they were really affectionate with each other and gave each other a kiss which lasted much longer then a platonic kiss should last 20 seconds maybe a little longer without going into all the details the kiss was more than just friends they seemed like something more going on and were very affectionate with each other

494364 claro que animo a las parejas casadas a rezar para que tengan una buena y feliz vida sexual para ellos es un medio de acercarse a dios
494365 la gente est un poco sorprendida al principio pero agradablemente sorprendida
494366 si crees en dios crees que dios est presente en la vida en el amor en el matrimonio y en la sexualidad parece natural hablar de sexo y suprimir algunos tab es y etiquetas del pecado
494367 el amor de una pareja casada expresado en el sexo acerca el cuerpo humano al cielo el xtasis de una relaci n sexual puede compararse a la alegr a de la vida eterna

494430 ich h tte gedacht dass es zwischen ferrari und mclaren ausgeglichener sein w rde dass mclaren so stark ist verwundert mich schon

494451 even knowing what you know now you still would not have supported the surge
494452 yeah it was a reference to my race so what i am different than any of those guys i am black in case you havent noticed
494453 its a bonus for anyone like me who didnt know what to do with coins and didnt throw them away
494454 everyone is totally confused maybe things will settle down in a few days its farcical at the moment
494455 on inspection engineers determined that fluid was coming from the spoiler actuator that was not evident before departure
494456 our judgement is that this merciless attack was the work of the bloody separatist group
494457 its not necessarily james bond like spying where you have some super spy penetrating the deepest u s secrets
494458 its trying relentlessly to get defense related technology from u s companies u s engineers and the u s military
494459 theyre claiming that we built this house with money he earned illegally
494460 theres isnt a shred of truth in it not one dime

494462 on the honesty and the loyalty of the current security force in kirkuk
494463 marginalize any other ethnic group control kirkuk and annex it to kurdistan
494464 the kurds want to lay bricks for an independent state but escalating tensions will not bring any good to anyone
494465 when that happens on the field usually guys have helmets on
494466 but this happened on the sidelines so it probably wasnt a good idea
494467 he was trying to apologize so i was walking with him just to be there
494468 i dont anticipate this having any lingering effect on this team
494469 we were talked to and things were squashed thats it thats the way it is it happened there will be no retaliation by anybody on anything when you look at the schedule we dont play the panthers this year so we need to be smart when were out there
494470 when i was 22 i was a different guy so im not trying to spin anything
494471 you spend two hours with somebody and now you know them thats not the case
494472 obviously everybody is going to be waiting to see what the repercussions are from this event
494473 im just praying that we rally together as a team because obviously theres going to be some adversity here
494474 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall

494476 the new prime minister yousuf raza gilani who was in washington this week to meet president bush says he is doing his best to convince his country that this is pakistans war but he seems not to have won the argument within his own government
494477 this complex situation calls for a careful and flexible response from the united states and to its credit the outgoing bush administration is making a relatively good start at fashioning that response
494478 you cant run a government and you cant run a company or anything like that unless everybody is on side
494479 if they are not on side he should kick them out and then what he should do is tell the rest of the world that he has been appointed to do a job for two years and let me get on with it and then at the end of that period of time judge me then
494480 its very easy for people to blame the top man when things are no good but what you have to look deeper at is what these problems are
494481 its not just recently that i have backed gordon brown
494482 ive known him for a long time as chancellor and i have got to know him quite well and out of the last four prime ministers that i have had the pleasure to have met i think he is a very very clever man and a man who is over everything and knows what is going on
494483 he may not come across as some kind of actor of some kind but he has got his hand on the pulse
494484 were trying to get them thinking about and planning for plan b and plan c in the event their first choice is not available
494485 the first semester the economy was still good jobs were aplenty i didnt think there would be problems
494486 but as soon as 2008 hit the economy took a big downturn and the jobs dried up from last year to this year its changed quite a bit and its definitely been more difficult than i had anticipated
494487 we have been beating about the bush and we have been spending a lot of time sharing and listening to each other
494488 i would like to see if we can have some suggestions coming out from this conference from where you can go from here rather than simply talking about the things we have been talking about for years
494489 through dialogue and diplomatic negotiations in order to maintain the security and the stability of the region
494490 through dialogue and diplomatic negotiations between the concerned sides the commitment to the relevant international resolutions and guaranteeing the transparency in order to maintain the security the stability and the environment and the sustained development in the region
494491 through peaceful means either through direct bilateral negotiations or by referring the case to the international court of justice
494492 take the necessary measures within the framework of the international law in order to establish a zone free of weapons of mass destruction including nuclear weapons in the middle east and the gulf the minister also demanded to exert pressure on israel so as to accede to the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt and place its nuclear facilities under the surveillance of the iaea in compliance with the un relevant resolutions
494493 warrants a true commitment to the principles it was founded for especially the principle of respecting the sovereignty of states the peoples right for self determination the non interference into other states affairs and the settlement of conflicts and cases of foreign occupation through peaceful means in compliance with the provisions of the international legitimacy
494494 this council cannot ignore the terrible crimes that have occurred throughout the conflict in darfur
494495 no progress will be possible without the full cooperation of the sudanese government
494496 the question here is who is the bad actor if the u s wants to keep the pressure on bashir they dont want to suggest that somehow he is being unfairly targeted he is not
494497 everyone thats worked with ron paul or knows him on any level says this isnt ron paul that its too out of character and not even his style of writing consider what the head of an naacp chapter says about ron paul and the charge of racism

494502 im very excited about this tour and i look forward to connecting with my european fans over the next six weeks
494503 efforts have been made to scale up our activities in the prevention of infection and providing succour to those who have been infected or affected by the virus i am happy to note that the nawoca is gradually gaining ground with the establishment of state and local government chapters and it is our hope that in future nawoca will have its branches at ward levels in our country
494504 the launch of the chapters at zonal levels is meant to speed up coverage of the entire country in order to facilitate a well coordinated effective response against the epidemic
494505 i would like to use this opportunity to also call on the national agency for the control of aids and ogther donor agencies to always assist wives of state governors directly while preparing for the launching of the state chapters of nawoca i would like to reaffirm my resolve and commitment to continue contributing my quota using the instrumentality of nawoca at all levels in the struggle against hiv aids
494506 in 2002 only ten thousand people were being treated freely for hiv but the figure has improved now two hundred and sixty nine thousand persons are being treated freely now for hiv efforts are still being intensified because young people are still catching the virus women and children are the worst affected
494507 the question of power has been settled by the elections

494540 american investigators probing anthrax outbreaks in florida and new york believe they have all the hallmarks of a terrorist attack and have named iraq as prime suspect as the source of the deadly spores their inquiries are adding to what us hawks say is a growing mass of evidence that saddam hussein was involved possibly indirectly with the 11 september hijackers
494541 according to sources in the bush administration investigators are talking to egyptian authorities who say members of the al qaida network detained and interrogated in cairo had obtained phials of anthrax in the czech republic last autumn mohamed atta is said by us intelligence officials to have met in prague an agent from iraqi intelligence called ahmed samir al ahani a former consul later expelled by the czechs for activities not compatible with his diplomatic mission
494542 it was confirmed yesterday that jim woolsey cia director from 1993 to 1996 recently visited london on behalf of the hawkish defence department to firm up other evidence of iraqi involvement in 11 september some observers fear linking saddam to the terrorist attacks is part of an agenda being driven by us hawks eager to broaden the war to include iraq a move being resisted by the british government
494543 u s officials let saddam know during the gulf war that if he used such agents against u s forces he would get a destructive response
494544 but that doesnt mean he or his agents might not want to unleash the weapon from a deniable distance or via third parties his anti american animus hasnt lessened since his gulf defeat and czech government sources have reported that atta the hijacking mastermind met at least once with iraqi diplomat ahmad samir al ani in prague
494545 what weve got to be certain about above all is whether it came from a country supporting these terrorists as a matter of policy such as iraq which we know has made this stuff and theres a credible report not fully verified that they may indeed have given anthrax to exactly the group that did the world trade center its possible that many months ago anthrax a small quantity of it was handed over in prague to mohamed atta and the person who handed it over in prague was an iraqi
494546 in order to find evidence of what wolfowitz and his boss defense secretary donald rumsfeld believed to be true that saddam hussein had close ties to al qaeda and that iraq had an enormous arsenal of chemical biological and possibly even nuclear weapons that threatened the region and potentially the united states

494553 the pretended vicar of christ on earth who sits as god over the temple of god exalting himself not only above all that is called god but over the souls and consciences of all his vassals yea over the spirit of christ over the holy spirit yea and god himself speaking against the god of heaven thinking to change times and laws but he is the son of perdition ii thess 2
494554 he is in an emphatical sense the man of sin as he increases all manner of sin above measure and he is too properly styled the son of perdition as he has caused the death of numberless multitudes both of his opposers and followers he it is that exalteth himself above all that is called god or that is worshipped claiming the highest power and highest honour claiming the prerogatives which belong to god alone
494555 whereof it followeth rome to be the seat of antichrist and the pope to be very antichrist himself i could prove the same by many other scriptures old writers and strong reasons
494556 that tyranny which the pope himself has for so many ages exercised over the church
494557 the very antichrist and son of perdition of whom paul speaks
494558 some persons think us too severe and censorious when we call the roman pontiff antichrist but those who are of this opinion do not consider that they bring the same charge of presumption against paul himself after whom we speak and whose language we adopt i shall briefly show that pauls words in ii thess 2 are not capable of any other interpretation than that which applies them to the papacy
494559 we here are of the conviction that the papacy is the seat of the true and real antichrist personally i declare that i owe the pope no other obedience than that to antichrist

494581 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
494582 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
494583 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
494584 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
494585 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
494586 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
494587 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
494588 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
494589 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
494590 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
494591 we have all been under pressure jock hobbs and the board the administration the team the new zealand rugby public just wanted a performance and they got a performance tonight that was right out of the top drawer
494592 it will give us some foundation some confidence and a wee bit of relief from the pressure
494593 so we can build from there hopefully but the game in cape town will be massive and the game in brisbane will be massive
494594 both teams playing in those two encounters will be absolutely on the edge of the edge so its going to be pretty special
494595 im very proud of the team i though they played exceptionally well it keeps us alive in the tri nations and the bledisloe cup
494596 we dont underestimate the magnitude of that task we have two away games now but it was a fine performance and im very proud of the guys who did the job
494597 we learnt a lot from last week the players learnt a lot the coaches learnt a lot we changed the game plan around and the guys executed that exceptionally well
494598 i thought the front five had a hell of a big game
494599 they the wallabies never got any front foot ball and some of the tackles that went in forced turnovers
494600 we put the ball at the right end of the field that came about from pressure and we camped down their end of the field for periods and got the points we were after
494601 i thought they australia played bloody well last week and i thought we played pretty well this week i think the next contest is going to be massive because both teams will have equal edge
494602 i think its just edge and the tactical approach as wayne said every dog has its day and it just happened to be our day
494603 yeah i know i belong to the group this is our party
494604 its half five that means its the second fuck that

494653 this is one of most exciting times of the year for student athletes the sense of anticipation and excitement as the students start the school year is also the continuation of a tradition that started 88 years ago the students in 1921 had the same feelings of anticipation perhaps even trepidation of starting something new that the students have today its a great time in a students life

494657 the next question we must consider is this what did they come together for here were these people who had come out of the world to join the group of people called disciples and they formed the first church but what is the christian church for what does she do what does she provide do christian people come together for socials dances raffles dramatic performances lectures on politics literature and sociology there was nothing like that in the early church it is not my object to denounce such things but i do want to show how far removed they are from the christian church you can get all that in the world and you can get it very much better there the christian church makes a fool of herself when she attempts these things she does them so badly if you want activities like that then go and get them organized professionally those people the new testament church did not come to the church to do things like that and when true revival takes place those are the first things to go people lose interest in them a church that can only exist by resorting to things like that is utterly different from the new testament church

494685 todays supreme court decision is yet another stinging rebuke of the bush administrations extreme views on executive power time after time the supreme court has rebuffed the administrations attempts to undermine the constitution from its rasul and hamdi decisions in 2004 to its hamdan decision in 2006 it is a testament to our system of government that the court has rejected the habeas stripping provisions of the military commissions act and reaffirmed that the government does not have the power to detain people indefinitely and arbitrarily without judicial review the writ of habeas corpus provides one of the most significant protections of human freedom against arbitrary government action ever created we can and must fight terrorists without abandoning the principles on which our country was founded

495056 in another saner time a satirical unflattering caricature of anyone especially of a presidential candidate would not be newsworthy or anything to make a fuss about in public think of all the cartoons and comedy skits that mocked jfk and jimmy carter and gerald ford certainly ive been lampooned and depicted as an aging mummer and some of those cartoons are very clever but ive seen much worse caricatures of senator obama in the press here and overseas than what i saw on the cover of the new yorker and no one objected to them so i dont understand the uproar over it the irony is that the new yorker is senator obamas friend not mine and the cover was meant to help him do him a favor and now everyones expecting the magazine to apologize well maybe too many people are just slow witted or thin skinned to get the covers joke but that shouldnt be an obstacle to anyones freedom of expression or speech im reminded of british prime minister robert walpole lustily joining in one of the choruses when he attended john gays the beggars opera in 1728 in many respects an unflattering critical musical satire on him and his own government

495063 theyre the government of the palestinians sooner or later we are going to have to deal with them one way or another and i understand why this administration and previous administrations had such antipathy towards hamas because of their dedication to violence and the things that they not only espouse but practice so but its a new reality in the middle east i think the lesson is people want security and a decent life and decent future that they want democracy fatah was not giving them that

495112 we do not exist for ourselves alone and it is only when we are fully convinced of this fact that we begin to love ourselves properly and thus also love others it is because of our deficiencies that we need others and others need us we are not all weak in the same spots and so we supplement and complete one another each one making up in himself for the lack in another the meaning of my life is not merely in the sum total of my own achievements it is seen only in the complete integration of my achievements and failures with the achievements and failures of my own generation and society and time it is seen above all in my integration in the mystery of christ

495202 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
495203 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
495204 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
495205 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
495206 i dont have to worry about the funds or the money all i have to worry about is my actual education
495207 it really didnt click until i read newtons name i was just in shock i didnt even know they were in a shelter
495208 its amazing that they were so close and i didnt really know anything
495209 its going to be a nice reunion i just got to be prepared
495210 i really think it was probably as a result of the story in the daily news that other people found out about nicholas plight
495211 i will find a job regardless of what it is
495212 people coming to my job and taking me out of my sessions im getting used to it
495213 now if they had drawn the hand of a republican elephant in the corner as if a republican were the cartoonist there would have been a twist maybe they tried that or something else and it was too klunky so they said well lets just go with this
495214 now the vanity fair cover doesnt work too mccain is drawn as sort of old and cindy has the pills but theres no twist there either
495215 the obama cover wasnt over the top enough it just took those untruths and depicted them part of the problem they had was that so many of those rumors are so over the top how do you make something absurd even more absurd
495216 i have an opinion i have a right to have one and thats the way i feel i felt ive played against the best over the years and felt right now that im the best player in the world
495217 it is impossible to speak in such a way that you cannot be misunderstood
495218 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
495219 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
495220 stuff that would be easily accessible to people who are were not art educated without dumbing down
495221 there is no point in doing florentine gold ground people get that on christmas cards i wanted things that arent stale
495222 i keep hearing ashton kutcher say how he was responsible for trucker caps its funny trace ayala his bff and i were wearing them when we were 17
495223 justin looks so stiff in those pictures when he is touching her back and their smiles look so force he doesnt look like hes into her in my opinion
495224 its time to show hrc what real solidarity looks like
495225 transgender and labor activists united in san francisco to build the largest protest ever of hrc and we plan to show the country boston can too
495226 hrc has spent millions of dollars on fighting losing marriage battles throughout the country but has done little to help grassroots organizers make the world a safer place for queer youth and the trans community weve had enough hrc does not speak for us
495227 my research has combined two different but complementary principles for handling complex planning problems developed within the computer science disciplines of artificial intelligence and formal verification
495228 members know that they have the option to be involved in political action or not
495229 obviously general funds were used for the political action committee which violates the rights of the members to decide whether they wanted to participate in political activities are not
495230 did not see approval of the additional expenses in the talb board minutes or representative council minutes
495231 thats it how was it done i just dont have the particulars in front of me
495232 they were held outside talb offices in secret places and we had no idea where they were
495233 should not be secured with funds from the general fund as that restricts cash necessary for the payment of the ongoing operations of talb
495234 there might have been problems with our procedures and some of the ways that we deal with our finances
495235 but through the audit and through a lot of work we rectified a lot of those problems or virtually all of those problems
495236 its the members money of course they have every right to know
495237 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
495238 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
495239 what i did was reach out to senator dick lugar a republican
495240 computers are programmed to perform the best strategy but bluffing is based on unexpected illogical actions
495241 they think justin can reel in young viewers and make the show much more exciting
495242 justins more than a a song and dance man justin does it all and he knows how to work a star studded audience our first question was can we get him
495243 so justin left in another car and didnt leave with jessica i guess this puts those stories to rest that they moved in together
495244 as in the first century we can expect the holy spirit to press us to listen to each other to state new insights frankly and to accept implications of the gospel new to us whether painful or exhilarating

495255 you tip your office floor up 20 degrees and try standing on it its pretty substantial especially as the whole thing is moving
495256 thats when things really started to fly there was just stuff everywhere people were screaming and sliding across the boat from one end to the other

495788 i dont think its accurate to say that my comments have nothing to do with race
495789 heres what i was saying and i think this should be undisputed that i dont come out of central casting when it comes to presidential races for a whole range of reasons im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama i am african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate what that means is that im sort of unfamiliar and people are still trying to get a fix on who i am where i come from what my values are and so forth in a way that might not be true if i seemed more familiar
495790 and so what i think has been an approach of the mccain campaign is to say hes risky
495791 to try to divert focus from the fact that they dont have any new ideas when it comes to fixing the economy or dealing with health care or dealing with education let me be clear in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist i think theyre cynical and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues and so its of a piece with the britney paris ad or the most recent web site or the allegation that somehow i wouldnt go visit the troops unless i had reporters with me which every reporter who was on the trip knows is absolutely not true

495822 tried hard to impress the world and to prove the country deserves respect and appreciation
495823 but the west used the olympic torch relay and the coming games to shame the country and frequently remind the chinese they were not good enough
495824 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
495825 were teaching them that the olympic spirit is international that it doesnt just belong to one country
495826 they said this was the first time that china was communicating to the outside world rather than waiting for the world to come to us
495827 we hoped that the olympics would help people understand our countrys achievements that this ancient civilization has started a new chapter
495828 but from the torch relay we suddenly realized that we were preparing to open the nations front door to welcome people who do not wish us well
495829 here we build sports venues fix rail lines and construct airports hurrying like a raging fire to prepare there people use darfur one day and tibet the next to fan the flames of protest and boycott whats going on
495830 this is a hot face pressed on a cold rump
495831 there were signs of apprehension about the country and its growing power
495832 it was because of cnn and bbcs attitude so we did not broadcast at that time
495833 it was because the earthquake happened the march 14 beating smashing and looting incident happened the timing was up to us
495834 these olympics will perhaps hurt the feelings of other countries but it will be good for chinese
495835 we care less about human rights than other countries and more about sovereignty thats bound to create an awkward feeling among other countries
495836 its clear the banks are increasing their profit margins because they can
495837 there are very strong signs all the indicators show it that there are problems on the way if not here already
495838 these days lenders make money from keeping people in debt for more and for longer
495839 australia desperately needs to fix its weak regulation of reckless lending we need an effective legal duty on lenders to give a loan only if the consumer can actually afford to repay it
495840 i am extremely pessimistic about the way australia is heading
495841 what you need to watch very closely in australia is what is happening to your main trade partners in asia if you conclude that there is a slowdown taking place then you will be left alone to deal with your over valued housing market which could cause a recession
495842 if commodity prices drop you will see a decline on the same lines as the uk a drop of 15 or 20 per cent
495843 australian banks perceived immunity to the world financial crisis turns out to have little basis in reality
495844 in the near term this is bad news for the australian dollar in the longer term it is worse as australias structural problems come to the fore

495859 i have never said that brian kerr is not good enough for us
495860 i am very frustrated and angry that his picture was used by a newspaper as part of this story
495861 brian kerr is not one of the guys and its very very unfair
495862 he is a fantastic playmaker and a good passer of the ball
495863 it was to give them time to find new clubs because if players will find it difficult to break into the team its better for them to go elsewhere to develop
495864 we have the quality and the standards and just need to do it on the pitch
495865 i felt the boys worked very very hard and it was a good performance
495866 i am very disappointed in the manner that we lost the goals in the last 20 minutes all crosses
495867 we go back to the players mentality unfortunately in the last 20 minutes they lost concentration and we were punished by a very good side
495868 why do top managers steeped in theories of good business strategy still make bad decisions while ignorance and hubris sometimes play a role the brain itself how we think is also a culprit insights from behavioral economics help explain why we dont always think rationally and how our logical flaws can lead to bad strategic decisions
495869 id be curious if anyone can come forth with any data to show that in fact as opposed to in repute more expensive law firms produce better results e g can it be shown that the investment banks who had the largest losses on their mortgage portfolios were served by lower reputation law firms once this conversation settles down i will start a separate string and perhaps a wiki to really pull something together on what i consider to be the core issue how can we develop a definition of value in legal services that is meaningful and useful and not simply measuring inputs like hours spent diligence of lawyers law school attended or reputation of the firm with such a definition of value i think we could expect that some lawyers reputations and income would go up but some would not
495870 the point that i was making was to identify three elements that contribute to profitability by optimizing the management and execution of a supply chain

495881 stark reminders of the fragility of peace in the sudan
495882 the root cause of the problem has been the failure of the two parties to agree on an approach to implement the abyei protocol
495883 we need an independent electoral commission so that we can get the military and security agents out of the electoral process because they promote the nrm interests
495884 the other area of co operation we need to work on
495885 is fielding one candidate and formation of a coalition government after winning elections this is what we call electoral alliance
495886 the issue of fielding a single presidential candidate is something that is so far away
495887 we need to study each other and build confidence you cant rush just to remove the nrm for the sake of it before you reach a point of talking about one presidential candidate build confidence stop bashing each other and we must develop a working relationship
495888 we are moving in different directions the opposition who came before us view new entrants with suspicious eyes and that dents the single candidate project
495889 we need to look at our programmes examine them and harmonise our strategies
495890 nobody has told me anything that is contrary to this approach
495891 i think all those who are pro democracy are pro co operation but there are malingerers within the opposition there are sympathisers of the ruling regime who claim to be with us but are with the nrm
495892 yes collaboration is all right but we need to ensure the electoral law is changed in time
495893 the question of presidency and removal is diverting us from building parties as institutions
495894 there is no cabinet minister who has handed me a resignation letter but there are some cabinet members whom i wanted to replace who i heard are part of the ministers announcing their resignations
495895 i asked him for a debate on mohamed dheere but he pm nur adde said he there is no debate because he pm nur adde already made the decision to fire mohamed dheere
495896 the main risk factor is the low latrine coverage in the newly created idp camps or in the villages to which the people are returning most people use the bush and when it rains the water takes the faeces into water sources and contaminates them
495897 our population still practices communal hand washing or use water in the same basin so if one of them visited the toilet and his or her faeces had hepatitis e then the others will definitely get the virus
495898 an average of 112 people share one latrine in the idp camps almost six times above the standard requirement of 20 people per latrine

495917 and there is still more to be done so the tally is not in yet
495918 the cia group had to act quickly because federal bureau of investigation fbi agents who did not participate in the sept 11 attacks were closing in on the real source of the anthrax
495919 and then the real reason for sending out the anthrax letters would be revealed
495920 in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks congress was balking at passing the usa patriot act which was designed to eliminate the constitutional rights of all americans
495921 senators tom daschle and patrick leahy were holding it up in the senate because they realized the broad and sweeping new powers it would give to the president so the cias sept 11 working group on orders from vice president dick cheney obtained some weapons grade anthrax from a u s military lab they then sent some to daschle and members of the mainstream news media in order to create enough panic to enable the patriot act to pass

495927 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity
495928 as the commission finds are necessary to diminish eliminate or prevent such burden
495929 so far as the underlying spirit of imperialism is a frank acceptance of national duty exercised beyond the nations political frontiers so far as it is a claim that a righteous nation is by its nature restless to embark upon crusades of righteousness wherever the world appeals for help the spirit of imperialism cannot be condemned morality is universal i want to make it clear that however successful designing men may be in prostituting the high purposes of the nations to their own ends or however imperfectly the nations themselves interpret their ideals in their political policies the compulsion to expand and to assume world responsibility is worthy at its origin

496044 we have a proud history in racing with 54 continuous years of nascar involvement and have enjoyed worldwide success in all forms of racing
496045 but all should be assured that no one was more disappointed than we were with the events in indianapolis
496046 we are the first to admit that we missed the mark with the combination for this race there are many reasons but they are only important today from the perspective that we learn from those issues and move forward successfully
496047 the knowledgeable people in our business understand the solution to this issue involves all elements of the equation
496048 we are committed to working to bring those elements together in a manner that will produce consistent great racing
496049 our responsibility is to provide a tire that works with all of the variables and we take that responsibility very seriously we have been performance partners with nascar for more than 50 years and we are absolutely committed to remain in that role for another 50 years
496050 no one predicted that we would have such increased ridership last year we were running 1 6 million passengers on our trains in a 12 month period which is phenomenal
496051 since we started capitol corridor ten years ago our ridership has gone up 300 percent
496052 they both have pasty white faces and totally creepy smiles
496053 we dont mind john mccain going after us if he sticks to the facts
496054 but we are sick of the distortions about our record
496055 both of us strongly favor off shore drilling to reduce our dependence on foreign oil

496059 we will do whats necessary to remain competitive in the short term while balancing the need for continued investment in support of our long term strategy
496060 no ya dont you need to raise that pipeline up so the animals can migrate peacefully every here and there you also need to have emergency spill kits and plans approved by the government before you drill
496061 none other than se or mccain himself source shreveport times july 7th of this year
496062 rncs new multi million ad attacks easy target barack obama for his official energy
496063 it would take ten years to start pumping oil domestically
496064 this strikes me as less of a shift and more as a gesture of sorts to the reality that the major cap and trade legislation next year that congress will mark up legislation that will be introduced regardless of whos president requires the participation of and compromise from the industry
496065 sounds to me like he is hedging his bets as there is no place that the extremist environmentals will allow drilling to be done

496068 traditionally known for a grind it out style of offense pulaski robinson coach todd eskola hints the senators may put the ball in the air more this season
496069 the pulaski robinson senators were another bright spot going 4 0 1in before falling to the pulaski academy bruins in the quarterfinals of the tournament they were led by quarterback zack deymaz who threw a total of 22 touchdown passes and only two interceptions during the two day event
496070 needing a victory to get back into the playoff chase pulaski robinson found the perfect foil in little rock mcclellan brandon aldridge rushed for 98 yards and quarterback zack deymaz threw two touchdown passes to travis kidd in the final 40 seconds of the first half as the senators went on to claim a 39 0 victory over the lions in a 5asoutheast game at charlie george stadium we played one last week we probably should have won robinson coach todd eskola said of the previous weeks 29 19 loss at monticello monday at practice we told our guys it was the playoffs right now we had a great week of practice we didnt have any one who played both ways so we wouldnt wear anybody out the kids just played their guys out and played to their potential aldridge scored on runs of 18 and 7 yards in the second quarter in helping the senators build a 33 0 halftime lead mcclellan was held to five first downs and was held to 157 total yards lions quarterback elgin harris completed 8 of 24 passes for 98 yards and he led his team in rushing with 35 yards on 13 carries harris however was intercepted four times twice by marquis mcfadden mcfadden touched the ball only once on offense scoring on an 18 yard run with 20 seconds left in the first quarter kidd ran in the two point conversion for the senators 8 0 lead aldridges two scoring runs increased robinsons lead to 20 0 and the senators put the game away with deymaz two td throws in the final 27 seconds of the first half
496071 zack deymaz threw two touchdown passes and the pulaski robinson defense posted its second shutout in three weeks in leading the senators to a 13 0 victory over white hall in a 5a southeast game at charlie george stadium
496072 deymaz completed 14 of 25 passes for 226 yards connecting with marquis mcfadden for a 45 yard touchdown pass in the second quarter and with kareem norwood on a 23 yard scoring pass on the opening drive of the third quarter
496073 i believe i was throwing the ball real well tonight said deymaz who has led the senators 6 3 4 2 to three consecutive victories
496074 who showed me the way up when all i could see was down
496075 the soil was so wet from all the rain it was digging into raw meat
496076 when it rained as it often did the yard turned into a thick gumbo with the house floating in it like a soggy cracker
496077 bend ing my eye on vacancy and with the incorporal air do hold discourse
496078 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
496079 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
496080 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
496081 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
496082 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
496083 im going the ladys room to never come back routine
496084 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
496085 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
496086 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
496087 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
496088 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
496089 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
496090 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
496091 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
496092 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
496093 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
496094 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
496095 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
496096 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
496097 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
496098 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
496099 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
496100 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
496101 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
496102 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
496103 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
496104 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
496105 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
496106 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
496107 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
496108 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
496109 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
496110 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
496111 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
496112 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
496113 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
496114 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
496115 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
496116 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
496117 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
496118 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
496119 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
496120 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
496121 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
496122 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
496123 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
496124 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
496125 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
496126 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
496127 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
496128 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
496129 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
496130 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
496131 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
496132 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
496133 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
496134 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
496135 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
496136 a computer without windows is like chocolate cake without mustard
496137 a source close to amazon with direct knowledge of the numbers
496138 i dont want to cook so get a frozen thing that you can put in the oven its fend for yourself night
496139 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
496140 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
496141 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
496142 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
496143 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
496144 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
496145 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
496146 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
496147 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
496148 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
496149 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
496150 who are open to doing something on the production side
496151 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
496152 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
496153 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
496154 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
496155 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
496156 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
496157 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
496158 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
496159 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
496160 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
496161 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
496162 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

496164 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
496165 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

496167 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
496168 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
496169 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
496170 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
496171 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
496172 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

496181 instead of a clean launch i and reportedly hundreds of thousands of mac subscribers had days of problems and even when resolved the problems left what apple describes as 1 percent of its e mail users adrift from e mail for 10 days
496182 the companys mobileme stumble resulted from its increasing busyness and business
496183 apple has evolved from a has been to an also ran to a niche but pervasive force in computers smartphones and digital movie rentals and it continues to be a dominant force in digital music purchase and portable music and video playback
496184 apple scheduled four events for july 11 the release of iphone 2 0 software for existing iphone owners completion of the switchover of mac to mobileme which began disastrously two days earlier the release of the iphone 3g and the opening of the app store a marketplace for iphone and ipod touch software

496241 i had a lot of pressure today so im very pleased to win
496242 i didnt have so much confidence over the final stages so it was a question of trying to hang on and not make any mistakes
496243 it was very close all day so im really happy that this tactic worked it was definitely one of the toughest days of my career
496244 i dont think choosing the soft compound g force profiler on friday was an error
496245 it was a realistic option because certain portions were reported to be damp
496246 obviously i am happy to be second and before superpole i was a little bit worried because of the rain stopping out plans
496247 i was trying to improve my feeling a dry track and we did improve out performance
496248 im very happy to take pole today in such mixed conditions
496249 the wet superpole meant we had twelve laps available during the fifty minute session
496250 we decided to wait until the end of the session when the track would have had chance to dry out a bit and then i went out and did one lap to take a look at the track before going out on a qualifier with which i did three laps the last of which was my fastest and just fast enough to take pole

496256 it is always good to have both cars in the top 10 because tomorrow we have the possibility with both cars to score points
496257 in this moment of the championship it is important for us to score as many points as possible as here especially toyota is going really quick so for the constructors championship it is a little bit of a defensive race against toyota
496258 they will score more points than us probably so we need to limit the damage and to score as many points as we can
496259 the six cars in front of us those six cars have been quicker than us all weekend
496260 so i dont see tomorrow how we can be quicker than raikkonen or kubica and the toyotas and mclarens so for us it will be impossible to take positions from them
496261 maybe if there are retirements or problems we could take the benefits but in a normal race it will be impossible to do better than seventh
496262 we were struggling a little bit in q1 and q2
496263 but i think in q3 we were expecting eighth ninth or even 10th as we were not competitive in q2 and we decided to have a quite conservative strategy and think about the race
496264 so to be seventh is a good position for the strategy we chose so we are quite happy with the result
496265 its very tough to be in the top 10 today
496266 i mean it was close to fernando which was good
496267 im improving i think although i thought it was going to be a bit easier to make q3 than it was

496379 im young new to the national scene my name is barack obama im african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate
496380 people are still trying to get a fix on who i am where i come from
496381 if i was presumptuous or taking this for granted i wouldnt be working this hard this week im beat
496382 so obviously we think that were in a tight race and we think that this is going to be a close race all the way through
496383 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things that i dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of actual energy independence then thats something im open to
496384 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
496385 i just cant imagine the men who hunted those with nothing but spears
496386 if you cant believe the sarah story theres a lot in the ballot argument you cant believe
496387 however she was still 15 and was not equipped to make medical decisions on her own whether she was living with the father of her child or not
496388 we will modify the way we present sarah to be accurate with the information
496389 but we dont think the use of her story is marred
496390 a political party cannot be all things to all people
496391 if you are going to die before i do ask whether you can bring a friend
496392 those religious groups leading the war against the teaching of evolution are conspiracies of the inferior man against his betters
496393 a political party cannot be all things to all people
496394 we have got to move away from these beautifully choreographed speeches which appeal to groups of voters who are unassailably in the obama camp already
496395 what plays well with the educated liberal voter sometimes grates with the blue collar folk whom we need on our side if we are going to win
496396 even on his worst day bill clinton was able to signal that he understood voters concerns and that he felt their pain
496397 obama has no trouble with the campaign stagecraft but this isnt harvard its the beer hall he has to talk in language that people understand
496398 what plays well with the educated liberal voter sometimes grates with the blue collar folk whom we need on our side if we are going to win
496399 it wasnt exactly a coincidence that mccain chose those particular women for that ad
496400 between an endorsement that a candidate embraces or just rap star or even a guy like louis farrakhan saying something independently
496401 wanted to know where the good press coverage was coming from
496402 to advance the unity of working people to be a voice to be reckoned with by the obama administration which to me at this point looks like will be an overwhelming landslide victory over the republicans
496403 you are disowning everything frank marshall davis wrote who cares about the use of the term mentor look in any dictionary you are quibbling about terms that mean the same no matter who uses them how come you havent taken issue with the editor of the books john edgar tidwell and the publishers university of wisconsin press and university press of mississippi i think you should contact the editor and publishers and have them either stand behind what has been written or disown it as you are fully aware if you have ever read either of the two books the only thing i have done is quote the books and say the same thing the editor has stated
496404 if there is one thing frank marshall davis makes clear is that he had the utmost respect for communists because of the way communists fight for the rights of working people and against racism frank marshall davis was entitled to his political views there is no doubt he joined the ranks of members of the communist party usa along with his very good friends benjamin davis and paul robeson for you to deny this is cowardly shameful and disgusting
496405 after calling the publishers of daviss books they said they never heard from anyone in the family upset with anything in the books nor is the family contesting anything in the books
496406 i have had leanings in that direction i e marxism since i was in college
496407 this was of course consistent with the line of the communist party during the soviet nazi alliance against national defense
496408 about november 1950 the communist party in hawaii was reorganized on an underground basis in the new organization party groups were to consist of not more than three members groups were identified by numbers 1 10 rather than by names as formerly
496409 we find that there is no substance to these claims
496410 i would suggest that you take up your concerns with barack obama who first brought frank marshall davis to our attention
496411 hes not a communist you dont know what communism is
496412 is building dams on rivers flowing into the country on the other hand it is establishing training centres in afghanistan where it is teaching its agents how to carry out terrorist acts in pakistan while our rulers insist that we should have good relations with the afghan government india is imposing wars upon us still our rulers pursuing a policy of unilateral friendship under foreign pressure have promised the world we will not fight with india
496413 met rx chocolate roasted peanut protein bars and bottles of a hard to find organic brew called black forest berry honest tea
496414 its hard to imagine america responding to small ball when we have all these problems
496415 when was the last time you heard the word reform or service come out of his mouth
496416 we need to return to the john mccain who speaks his mind instead its dick butkus running a west coast offense or wilt chamberlain playing point guard its not going to work
496417 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things they dont like thats something im open to
496418 sen obama says he wants energy independence but he doesnt support anything that serves that goal
496419 he believes every domestic energy source has a problem i believe every energy source needs to be part of the solution
496420 we need oil drilling and we need it now we need it offshore
496421 instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices sen mccain touts his support for george bushs plan for offshore drilling
496422 the long term trend is for flat or decreasing oil supply and increased consumption
496423 what i dont want to do is for the best to be the enemy of good here
496424 i dont want partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing some genuine relief to people who are struggling
496425 we hope barack obama will realize that his ongoing opposition to john mccains realistic energy solutions and additional offshore drilling is wrong
496426 anything that would have an impact on that extraordinary treasure not just of floridas but of the country as a whole
496427 what smith did was wrong and we take very serious and he is being punished severely for it
496428 he knows what those are and we will move forward
496429 ken got overwhelmed with every single player coming up to him and telling him hello
496430 i think it was great that he came out today a lesser person would not have come out but he did and we cant wait to get him back
496431 i know hes extremely remorseful and he understands but if we want to be a good football team we have to win without him

496437 can britain survive multiculturalism id say the answer is no but that doesnt mean it cant fight and fight successfully against multiculturalism and ruinous cultural relativism but it will have to involve the reanimation of the central principles of western civilization virtues like patriotism public affirmation of the rule of law freedom of religion respect for individual initiative and equality before the law but britains confidence in democracy and christian civilization have been seriously weakened

496443 over 95 percent of people living with hiv are not transmitting to someone else in a given year
496444 what that says is the transmission rate has been kept very low by prevention efforts
496445 it is very unlikely there will be a heterosexual epidemic in countries outside sub saharan africa
496446 hiv wasnt going to rage through the billions in the general population and we knew it
496447 there is no good evidence that aids is likely to spread rapidly in the west among heterosexuals
496448 by that token so are most diseases you wont get tetanus if you avoid deep skin punctures and you probably wont get the common cold if you avoid crowds and wash your hands frequently
496449 i dont think it does anybody any good to pretend that everyone with hiv aids has engaged in sodomy or drug use

496454 i think it will be close tuesday i hope it goes in our favor if it fails well go in november
496455 there are roughly 225 000 more people living with hiv in the u s than previously suspected
496456 if you are a young gay black man the likelihood that you will encounter hiv is staggeringly high even if your personal behavior is no more risky than people in other communities
496457 the united states can be proud of having more than tripled its remarkable commitment to the global hiv aids epidemic
496458 these new figures from cdc demonstrate that the domestic epidemic needs a similar response
496459 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by the cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the u s hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease

496470 to adopt and adhere to meaningful nutrition based standards for marketing their products to children under 12
496471 the internet though far less costly than television has become a major marketing tool of food companies that target children and adolescents with more than two thirds of the 44 companies reporting online youth directed activities
496472 on the internet its virtually an unregulated media environment and one thats hard for people to keep track of parents who are concerned abut their childrens eating habits have to understand that you cant just look at whats happening on television thats not the way it is anymore its a pervasive marketing environment
496473 companies report 46 million for character or cross promotional brand licensing fees however most cross promotional arrangements do not require a fee in 2006 there were 81 media properties used by the target companies to promote their brands these cross promotions turn entire programs and movies into advertisements for the foods they promote yet they are not counted as expenditures
496474 the total expenditure figure does not include spending for advertising and product placement on general audience programming watched by children even though primetime shows such as american idol and the simpsons typically have larger child and teen audiences than programs considered childrens shows
496475 in school advertising does not include regional and local or franchise spending for fast food companies for example mcdonalds infamous report card advertising in seminole county florida was sponsored by a regional marketing association and would not have been counted in the ftc report
496476 as the ftc notes internet advertising particularly on company sponsored websites is relatively inexpensive expenditure data does not begin to capture its impact the amount of time children spend with the sites and the frequency of their visits

496495 the symphony is being driven too much by the musicians
496496 they didnt like the god like creature we provided them
496497 its not really plausible that they just dont want an orchestra is it
496498 to me those are impressive numbers about a boards participation
496499 no board can do better than 100 percent many dont reach it
496500 theres a real fear among many corporations of putting money into the symphony again without seeing progress on the restructuring plan

496506 no area in britain has been more written about more exploited as a source and site for the projection of public anxieties about proletarian combination or sexual promiscuity the state of the nation or the degeneration of the race
496507 there is no such thing as the single monolithic british muslim community that our politicians and media discuss britains one and a half million or so muslims belong to a remarkably diverse set of communities in all it is estimated there are over 50 ethnicities speaking almost 100 languages between them the voices of ordinary british muslims are rarely if ever heard amid the torrent of 9 11 and 7 7 inspired rage and let it be clearly said the representation of islam and their lives by the media in their own country
496508 barack obama directly intervened in last decembers presidential election in kenya supporting fellow luo tribesman raila odingas candidacy despite an agreement odinga signed to back radical muslims according to an explosive new book written by wnd senior staff reporter jerome r corsi
496509 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
496510 there is nothing on the record to indicate obama ever withdrew his support from odinga
496511 even after odinga signed the agreement with the muslims in kenya
496512 appears even today to be a direct and active supporter of odinga as odinga himself frequently boasts

496526 the dangers inherent in the foreign policy advocated by the neo conservatives are well known while many americans have become increasingly aware of those dangers far less attention has been focused on the dangers of neo conservative economic policies this issue is of critical importance right now because many are mistakenly pointing their fingers at the free market as the culprit behind our current economic plight

496547 we have got to move away from these beautifully choreographed speeches which appeal to groups of voters who are unassailably in the obama camp already
496548 what plays well with the educated liberal voter sometimes grates with the blue collar folk whom we need on our side if we are going to win
496549 even on his worst day bill clinton was able to signal that he understood voters concerns and that he felt their pain
496550 obama has no trouble with the campaign stagecraft but this isnt harvard its the beer hall he has to talk in language that people understand
496551 i have become a symbol of restoring america to its best traditions
496552 look obama has pulled off a good tour of europe and it was probably necessary
496553 what we need now is campaign events in hospital emergency rooms and in unemployment offices and small town diners these people have a vote
496554 i think the situation is still ongoing the transfer negotiations are still going on as far as i know
496555 i havent spoken to the chief executive today saturday so i cant tell you more than that hes the one negotiating with everton
496556 i think so ive no reason to believe he wont
496557 andy johnson is a player with great quality wherever hes been hes done very very well
496558 must persuade voters that she is one of the most liberal members of the senate
496559 thats the question can john kennedy turn her into a liberal northeasterner and thats where it gets more dangerous for her
496560 there are far far more people that can adopt than there are rescue groups it makes no sense to cut off one of the major avenues of getting dogs out of an animal shelter alive
496561 the way that were set up actually allows us to hold onto animals a little bit longer to try to wait for space to open up at the spca or wait for space to open up at the different rescues
496562 i think to put an adoption program in place that doesnt have all the necessary components that is spaying and neutering before releasing those animals would be a crime in itself
496563 there are just not enough rescue groups to take care of them all even the spca with all their really great facilities and their big facilities they cant do it either

496568 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work

496570 it felt really good to let that out and cross that line a little bit

496595 this year the multinational record labels will only release about 40 records by brazilian artists while tecnobrega artists will release around 400
496596 the record industry argues if intellectual property isnt protected there will be no innovation but tecnobrega has shown thats not true
496597 piracy in brazil is undermining the ability of the music and film industries to invest in the next generation of local talent lower revenues from current sales mean less money to invest in new artists

496655 we are constantly battling against increases of wealth theres a very fundamental problem here that no one really wants to talk about
496656 there is no way the government can hope to achieve any of its emissions targets without cheating unless it changes its policies on encouraging flying and hoping to satisfy peoples insatiable demands for buying more and more stuff
496657 we want you to not be able to buy things just because you want them we want you to be poor because poor people tend to be easier to control and we need to control what you buy and what you do
496658 strategic plan to set out very clearly how the uk will become a low carbon economy by 2050 at the moment there is no central priority for environmental issues consumers consumption of goods is the driver of emissions the continued pursuit of gdp of economic growth that is a mantra that we must question
496659 all you damn peasants stop buying and making things we mean it
496660 thats going to mean a very large cut 80 90 per cent in emissions within 40 years we need to increase energy efficiency sure but it wont do to just put in a few energy saving light bulbs we need to think bigger
496661 you need to make do with less because we say so its all to make mother gaia smile upon us so do what youre told
496662 its not enough to keep third world peoples living in dung huts and cutting wood to cook with we all except us elites who need modern stuff to keep you in line need to be living like its 1599 maybe 14
496663 economic wealth isnt the same as happiness or directly linked to quality of life its about a quantity lifestyle more and more stuff versus quality
496664 we say you will be happy peasants living in your eco villages you will be happier without all those electric conveniences and power tools and such and a lot easier to control but lets not mention that for now just like the piss poor natives gaia friendly peoples in third world countries are with their dirty water and smoke filled huts we say you will be so let it be written so let it be done
496665 the idea of a technological fix is one we should be cautious about
496666 so often there are unintended consequences or trade offs look at the paperless office theres now more paper not less look at biofuels id be wary of believing that a technology solution will arrive in time
496667 dammit stop looking for actual working ways to produce abundant cost efficient energy we do not want you to have that dont you understand

496675 if there is one thing i hope you remember from today its not my words or even those of the others here more eloquent than i but the celebration of this moment of your success your extraordinary accomplishment with your families friends fellow students and teachers may you have many celebrations like this in your life celebrate often and exuberantly and share it with others

496697 the failure of the talks this week is undoubtedly a setback to the multilateral trading system
496698 it adds to a growing list of global development challenges that must be confronted by countries in order to create the necessary and conducive conditions to promote development eliminate poverty and accelerate the achievement of the un millennium development goals mdgs
496699 every effort must be deployed by wto members to re commit themselves to the multilateral trading system to return to the negotiating table at the earliest possible juncture and deliver the development promise of the round
496700 the round provides a unique vehicle for re balancing the multilateral trading system in particular for addressing the long standing systemic distortions especially in regard to agricultural subsidies by developed countries

496705 a humanitarian crisis looms yet the government of zimbabwe continues to suspend most nongovernmental organizations access to vulnerable people in dire need of life saving humanitarian assistance
496706 immediately and completely rescind the june 4 ngo suspension order
496707 for two months now humanitarian workers have been ordered to stay in their offices instead of delivering aid to vulnerable children and families
496708 u n agencies have been blocked when trying to access areas of greatest need humanitarian workers are routinely harassed and intimidated and the financial resources of many organizations have been impounded by the zimbabwean authorities
496709 no regime should ignore the will of its own people and calls from the international community without consequences
496710 in light of the continued intransigence of the brutal mugabe regime the united states is imposing further sanctions against this regime and its supporters
496711 these actions send a clear warning to those who would protect mugabe and his assets at the expense of the zimbabwean people
496712 stands ready to support a legitimate government in zimbabwe through a robust package of development assistance debt relief and normalization with international financial institutions in the meantime

496730 in the early 15th century china was foremost in the world in oceangoing trade and exploration in 1433 the outcome of a political power struggle the causes of which now seem utterly trivial and only historians know of caused chinas great fleets to be recalled and its shipyards dismantled the country turned inward away from the world the retreat led to a cascading economic intellectual and technological stagnation from which china never recovered chinas many achievements thus became a historical footnote and the world was left open to the europeans

496739 there are a large number of smes operating in the construction sector who could play a major role in helping achieve greater materials resource efficiency through the use of recycled aggregates our previous study found evidence of a general misconception within sme contractors that recycled aggregates could not be used on major projects for public and private sector clients we also found that contractors and specifiers lacked the confidence to suggest the use of sustainable aggregates or to persuade their clients to use recycled aggregates on their projects our original research has given us a good understanding of the barriers that exist and has enabled us to develop material specifically designed to overcome them
496740 but since my mother died things have been much harder
496741 we did not know that she was underneath the rocks not until we saw her sandals
496742 i sat next to her and she showed me how to hold the hammer its not easy and at first i would hit my fingers so i cried a lot it made my mum very sad but she said we had to earn money to buy food
496743 if i stay in the house i feel lonely and i fear the memories

496748 our focus will be on consolidating in the international building materials industry and well be looking at europe and the us as well as the uk

496752 at night the task of the british patrols was particularly exacting not least due to the presence of huge numbers of lions
496753 obviously we have those notes from the previous race to go back on and we also unloaded in race trim yesterday and were fairly happy with our car
496754 we would have definitely liked to have gotten some laps in i think everybody here would have but i dont think were really too concerned about it our ford was pretty fast
496755 definitely at pocono track position is every bit as important if not more important than anywhere we race so starting up there and having good pit stops all day will be key
496756 the bonus points were giving up to kyle busch right now
496757 youve got jimmie johnson now that has won his second race carl edwards has won three
496758 you just dont want to give up any points to those guys going into the chase
496759 i really think as a race team if you just put us equal with everybody right now i think we have a shot at the championship
496760 when you put us 20 30 70 points behind those three guys thats tough to overcome
496761 i think we can maybe even win some races in the chase but to go out there and outperform those guys every single weekend and make up all those points is tough to do
496762 good thing we ran some race trims in practice yesterday which typically this year we havent been doing in practice
496763 we have been going straight to qualifying trim i think it was a good call to run some race runs the car was comfortable and i think it will race good obviously we didnt qualify good but i am confident that we are going to race well we always do
496764 im pleased to tell you that the entire plot is illuminated a big part of the perpetrators were arrested in the light of strong evidence that doesnt leave any room for doubt
496765 those who helped abetted and actively took part in the bombings were arrested

496772 we are going through a bit of a difficult time but we mustnt give up

496777 from what happened in his last start its kind of hard to feel as confident as i was for the derby and those other races
496778 but i feel as confident as i can be that hes going to run his race
496779 im still kind of concerned about whats going to happen sunday because i know the horse went into the belmont in very good condition and whatever happened in that race i have no idea
496780 but if it happens again then im going to know something is wrong with just not going to run anymore stuff like that you know
496781 big brown is the story and rightfully so and we hope our horses come to play and see what happens
496782 it just didnt come to me you know im just not on top of things like that i guess i should have said something to mike its just so unimportant to me i just dont get it
496783 he could be better than the big brown leading up to the kentucky derby
496784 we are very excited to see him come into the race the right way we could not be happier with the way he is doing i think he is a horse that has captured the imagination of racing and to see him perform so poorly in the belmont was so disappointing to the horse
496785 so our matching legs are marching clocks and were all too small to talk to god yes were all too smart to talk to god

496795 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
496796 lets not be naive senator obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
496797 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
496798 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
496799 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
496800 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
496801 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
496802 john mccain looks forward to debating barack obama as often as possible
496803 its revealing about the nature of his campaign and the priorities he has that he cant seem to find the time
496804 i am indeed a servant of god he has given me revelation and made me a prophet he has blessed me and has told me to pray and give charity as long as i live he has made me kind to my mother and not overbearing
496805 i was told by salim that abdullah bin umar i had said i took part in a holy battle with allahs apostle i in najd
496806 the prophet said if the number of the enemy is greater than the muslims they can pray while standing or riding individually
496807 o allahs apostle i have not offered the asr prayer and the sun has set
496808 the prophet then went to buthan performed ablution and performed the asr prayer after the sun had set and then offered the maghrib prayer after it
496809 years later i saw bill hubbards name on the memorial to the missing at aras
496810 when was it that you saw his name on the memorial
496811 yea yea you live around here long enough and those things are not even interesting anymore
496812 take your hand from gods messengers beard while it is still yours to take
496813 o people i have been sent as an envoy to kings to caeser chosroes and the negus but i have not seen a king whose men so honor him as the companions of muhammad honor muhammad
496814 o messenger of god i pledge my allegiance to that which is in your soul
496815 i do not know of a god named rahman just write bismik allahomma in your name o god that is much more factual
496816 these are the terms between muhammad the messenger of god and suhayl the son of amr
496817 if we knew you to be the messenger of god we would not have stopped you from coming to the kaba and we would not have fought you just write muhammad the son of abdullah
496818 o muslims are you going to send me back to the idol worshippers for them to prosecute me because of my religion
496819 be patient abu jandal god will surely give you and the other muslims in mecca relief and a way out we have agreed on the terms of a truce with these people and have given them a solemn pledge we cannot break our word
496820 are we not in the right and our enemies in the wrong
496821 then why should we give in and discrace the honor of our religion
496822 i am gods messenger and i will not disobey him he will give me the victory
496823 that we should go to the kaba and make our rounds about it
496824 i did say that but did i say this year
496825 there has descended upon me a surah which is dearer to me than all else beneath the sun
496826 gods good pleasure was on the believers when they swore allegiance to you under the tree he knew what was in their hearts and he sent down the spirit of peace to them and he rewarded them with a speedy victory
496827 and remember when we showed ibrahim the site of the sacred house the kaba at makkah saying ascribe not anything in worship with me and sanctify my house for those who circumambulate it and those who stand up for prayer and those who bow submit themselves with humility and obedience to allah and make prostration in prayer
496828 say surely my prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are all for allah the lord of the worlds
496829 and proclaim among men the pilgrimage they will come to you on foot and on every lean camel coming from every remote path
496830 i have learnt everything there was to be learnt father

496855 if you anyone find no time for my remembrance and for begging my favours due to remaining engaged in the recitation of the qur an i shall give him more than what i give to all those who beg favours of me
496856 that is the door of heaven opened today which was never opened before

496858 by allah so many angles came to convey this surah that the corners of the heavens became covered with their great numbers the excellence of surah kahf 18
496859 zuh nun prophet yunus while in he was in the stomach of the fish whale said this as mentioned above any distressed muslim who utters these words shall surely be relieved of this distress
496860 that who recites it at the outset of the day and he presents it before performing his need then it is done for him
496861 for every thing a bride and the bride of the holy qur an is the most forgiving surah the excellence of surah waqi a 56
496862 that who recites al waqi a surah during the night then poverty will ever strike him the excellence verses of surah hashr 59 22 24

496871 seaborn is a unique fantasy its unlike anything else ive read
496872 we travelled with the prophet from medina to mecca and offered two rakat for every prayer till we returned to medina
496873 truly to allah we belong and truly to him we shall return
496874 i prayed two rakat with allahs apostle at mina and similarly with abu bakr and with umar during their caliphates
496875 may i be lucky enough to have two of the four rakat accepted by allah
496876 a woman should not travel for more than three days except with a dhi mahram i
496877 a woman should not travel for more than three days except with a dhi mahram
496878 it is not permissible for a woman who believes in allah and the last day to travel for one day and night except with a mahram
496879 when the prayers were first enjoined they were of two rakat each later the prayer in a journey was kept as it was but the prayers for non travellers were completed
496880 i asked urwa what made aisha pray the full prayers in journey
496881 i saw allahs apostle delaying the maghrib prayer till he offered it along with the isha prayer whenever he was in a hurry during the journey
496882 ibn umar used to do the same whenever he was in a hurry during the journey
496883 ibn umar used to pray the maghrib and isha prayers together in al muzdalifa
496884 ibn umar delayed the maghrib prayer because at that time he heard the news of the death of his wife safiya bint abi ubaid
496885 whenever the prophet was in a hurry he used to delay the maghrib prayer and then offer three rakat of the maghrib and perform taslim and after waiting for a short while iqama used to be pronounced for the isha prayer when he would offer two rakat and perform taslim he would never offer any optional prayer till the middle of the night when he used to pray the tahajjud
496886 allahs apostle used to offer the optional prayer on the back of his mount facing any direction and also used to pray the witr on it but never offered the compulsory prayer on it
496887 i have seen you offering the prayer in a direction other than that of the qibla
496888 if i had not seen allahs apostle doing it i would not have done it
496889 i accompanied the prophet and he did not offer optional prayers during the journey and allah says verily
496890 331 i accompanied allahs apostle and he never offered more than two rakat during the journey
496891 on the day of the conquest of mecca the prophet took a bath in my house and offered eight rakat
496892 allahs apostle used to pray the nawafil on the back of his mount carriage by signs facing any direction
496893 abdullah bin umar said i saw allahs apostle delaying the maghrib prayer till he offered it along with the isha prayer whenever he was in a hurry during the journey
496894 the imam is to be followed and so when he bows you should bow and when he lifts his head you should also do the same
496895 the imam is to be followed so if he says takbir you should also say takbir and if he bows you should also bow and when he lifts his head you should also do the same and if he says liman hamidah allah hears whoever sends his praises to him you should say rabbana walakal hamd o our lord
496896 if he prays while standing it is better and he who prays while sitting gets half the reward of that who prays standing and whoever prays while lying gets half the reward of that who prays while sitting
496897 had piles so i asked the prophet about the prayer

496951 when lenders become increasingly cautious or restrictive and when it isnt only overleveraged structures that encounter financing difficulties at this juncture the risks of systemic economic contraction and asset depreciation become all too vivid
496952 the whole object of the accumulation of wealth is to produce results or potential results at a comparatively distant and sometimes at an indefinitely distant date thus the fact that our knowledge of the future is fluctuating vague and uncertain renders wealth a peculiarly unsuitable subject for the methods of classical economic theory

496958 a theory of the impact of debt on economic system behavior
496959 a model of a capitalist economy that does not rely upon exogenous shocks to generate business cycles
496960 the real problem is that financial markets fall in love they fall in love with new things with innovations and the important thing about new things is that it is very difficult to assess the real riskiness of them because you dont have a history by definition
496961 who now holds the risks associated with the present eras new investment instruments the honest answer is that we do not know much of the risk is embodied in various forms of asset backed securities of growing complexity and opacity they have been purchased by a wide range of smaller banks pension funds insurance companies hedge funds other funds and even individuals who have been encouraged to invest by the generally high ratings given to these instruments unfortunately the ratings reflect only expected credit losses and not the unusually high probability of tail events that could have large effects on market values bank for international settlements 2007 p 145

496973 they tell me there is reduced interest in the game and i think everybody involved in new zealand rugby from the board the all blacks and the public wanted a big performance

496976 i just hope that they have passion for things and im sure they will im sure their mother will instil that in them and whatever they see of me in direct memories and indirect memories uh will send that signal because if they have passion for things then im happy for whatever they have passion for

497058 the government of saudi arabia say that the judgement of the sighting of the new moon is based solely upon the principles of shariah and according to sighting with the naked eye not upon observatory calculations although a lot of people are not content with this announcement of the saudi government however there is no shari evidence to refute this either the reason for discontent they state is that many times the announcement contradicts observatory calculations i e a judgement of the sighting is taken when according to observatory calculations sighting is impossible in saudi arabia however as according to shari principles testimony is based upon sightings and not according to observatory calculations therefore if the people of germany act upon the judgement of saudi arabia according to shariah there is scope for this
497059 to observe ramadhan amp eid according to the sightings of saudi arabia is a debateable issue it is true that sometimes they announce the sightings when it is impossible according to observatory calculations however a very large group of jurists have relied upon testimony even in this state if the scholars of one country are unified upon this the issue being debateable and to act upon this to create unity between the muslims there is no shari obstruction although those who based their judgement upon morocco moon sighting seems more cautious however to choose the more cautious option moving away from the majority and becoming a source of conflict in the eyes of this humble servant is not appropriate
497060 this paper advances several arguments and rebuts others in an effort to prove that the only acceptable basis for determining the lunar month is the actual sighting of the dawning crescent at the root of the problem is a failure to recognize that the crescent moons appearance is a legal cause sabab determined by god in the quran and through his prophets words that being the case no scholar in the history of islam has ever permitted calculation in lieu of sighting until the modern era
497061 i argue that the actual naked eye sighting is the standard demarcator for establishing the entrance of the islamic lunar month based on the fact that the quranic verse they ask you about the crescent moons say they are a means to measure your specific times and are also for the commencement of the hajj 2 189 can only be interpreted literally this conclusion ensues because the verse is decisive in its evidentiary nature and unequivocal in meaning
497062 hence i argue that far from being an advancement moving to a calculated lunar calendar is a reversion to pre islamic jahili custom
497063 in addition to advancing proofs showing that none of our scholars advocated standardizing the determination of the beginning of the lunar months based on calculations i will show how the opinion of ibn daqiq al id has been misrepresented by the advocates of such calculations
497064 i conclude my argument by presenting the opinion of the four sunni schools and the jafari shia school that the norm for establishing the beginning of the lunar month is the actual naked eye sighting
497065 the islamic circle of north america icna has traditionally adopted the opinion of sighting the moon in north america on the advice of icnas scholars committee we have decided to continue following our existing approach and will not be adopting a calendar which is primarily based on calculations

497142 it will be interesting to see how the fcc will handle its newly created power because as an institution we are incapable of deciding any issue in the nanoseconds of internet time furthermore asking our government to make these decisions will mean that every two to four years the ground rules could change depending on election results
497143 i guess the riaa is getting nervous about the ability of its national law firm in charge of bringing ex parte motions securing default judgments and beating up grandmothers and children to handle the oral argument scheduled to be heard on monday august 4th in duluth in capitol v thomas so at the eleventh hour it has brought in one of its big guns from washington d c a lawyer who argues united states supreme court cases like mgm v grokster to handle the argument this is the case where a 222 000 verdict was awarded for downloading 24 songs but the judge ultimately realized that he had been misled by the riaa in issuing his jury instructions and indicated hes probably going to order a new trial but not to worry a group of 10 copyright law professors from 10 different law schools and several other amici curiae friends of the court have filed briefs now so it is highly unlikely the judge will allow himself to be misled again no matter who the riaa brings in as cannon fodder on monday

497198 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico

497206 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
497207 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

497213 if any evidence were to be presented against any individual in pakistan or against the interest of pakistans neighbors then the government would certainly act on that evidence
497214 several outstanding problems in the relationship between the united states and pakistan that the elected government inherited from the past are currently being resolved
497215 these include issues of trust between our two intelligence services
497216 if you ask me to describe the state of the dialogue it is in a place where it hasnt been in the last four years
497217 we face a situation where things have happened in the recent past which were unfortunate and which quite frankly have affected the future of the dialogue
497218 if you have this fluid situation you have elements within the army within the isi who have the opportunity to move forward with their own agenda with respect to afghanistan and india
497219 there is no direction this is what has opened up the door to these elements
497220 in the wake of political gridlock and a lack of a clear political direction some elements of the isi have started to exercise certain prerogatives
497221 in general this administration at its upper reaches has been cool to the elected government from the start
497222 they like to look at musharraf as a factor for stability
497223 its not disarray in the civilian government that has brought a lot of this to light
497224 its the fact that the change of government has brought out to the open a lot that was kept secret before
497225 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
497226 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
497227 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
497228 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
497229 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
497230 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
497231 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
497232 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
497233 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
497234 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
497235 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
497236 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
497237 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
497238 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
497239 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
497240 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
497241 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
497242 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
497243 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
497244 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
497245 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
497246 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
497247 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
497248 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
497249 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
497250 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
497251 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
497252 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
497253 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
497254 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
497255 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

497260 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
497261 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
497262 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

497266 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
497267 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
497268 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
497269 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
497270 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

497282 theres no doubt that when it comes to our treatment of native americans as well as other persons of color in this country weve got some very sad and difficult things to account for i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
497283 to acknowledge the fundamental injustice cruelty brutality and inhumanity of slavery in the united states and the 13 american colonies between 1619 and 1865 and to establish a commission to examine the institution of slavery subsequently de jure and de facto racial and economic discrimination against african americans and the impact of these forces on living african americans to make recommendations to the congress on appropriate remedies and for other purposes

497288 piper jet both got airborne for the first time in july 2008
497289 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
497290 were probably holding around 3 000 people you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
497291 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
497292 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
497293 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003
497294 the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
497295 the us may also have kept prisoners on ships within diego garcias territorial waters a contention the us has long denied
497296 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
497297 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the us did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
497298 is a violation of uk law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
497299 a us plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the us facility in diego garcia the detainees did not leave the plane and the us government has assured us that no us detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
497300 neither of the two detainees carried aboard the rendition flights that refuelled at diego garcia was ever part of the cias high value terrorist interrogation program
497301 the united states government confirmed that with the exception of two cases related to diego garcia in 2002 there have been no other instances in which us intelligence flights landed in the united kingdom our overseas territories or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 september 2001
497302 intentionally failed to ask the right questions of the us and accepted implausible us assurances at face value
497303 this remains a transatlantic cover up of epic proportions while the british government seems content to accept whatever nonsense it is fed by its us allies the sordid truth about diego garcias central role in the unjust rendition and detention of prisoners in the so called war on terror cannot be hidden forever
497304 it is deplorable that previous us assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false the failure of the united states administration to tell the truth resulted in the uk government inadvertently misleading our select committee and the house of commons we intend to examine further the extent of uk supervision of us activities on diego garcia including all flights and ships serviced from diego garcia
497305 responsible for the 9 11 operation from a to z
497306 diego garcia is an obvious place for a secret facility they want somewhere thats difficult to escape from difficult to attack not visible to prying eyes and where a lot of other activity is going on diego garcia is ideal
497307 i would like to be able to assure the public that this has been thoroughly investigated and reviewed
497308 we believe that this important investigation of serious infractions of marylanders most basic freedoms is now in good hands
497309 presumably this plan means that grocery stores and post offices will be encouraged to set up biometric enrolment kiosks with little financial gain to them unless the citizen is charged and thus while the headline costs of the scheme to the government go down the costs and risk to the citizen rise
497310 why dont ministers admit the inevitable and kill off this expensive and counter productive scheme
497311 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under the us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
497312 im not sure there was a written document confirming so but i do have holbrookes admission of verbal guarantees given to karadzic from the highest level of the us
497313 during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
497314 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in the eastern bosnian town of bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who to be replaced and who to be appointed to which position
497315 in america they went crazy realizing karadzic was making a fool of them
497316 the americans and cia then withdrew the informal protection enjoyed by karadzic
497317 hay tres tipos de personas las que hacen que las cosas sucedan las que observan c mo suceden y las que preguntan
497318 this program has helped us to take potential mass murderers off the streets before they have a chance to kill
497319 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
497320 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
497321 is a violation of u k law as well as of the bilateral agreement governing the island
497322 our intelligence and counterterrorism relationship with the u s is vital to the national security of the united kingdom we accept u s assurances on rendition in good faith but if others have definitive evidence of rendition through the u k or our overseas territories including diego garcia then we will raise it with the u s authorities
497323 neither of those individuals was ever part of cias high value terrorist interrogation program
497324 i think its important the british government makes plain its deep concern that its not being told the truth and that our territories are being used for these purposes
497325 if we see someone calling the police then we target them
497326 you are trying to stop me from what i live what i believe in and what i breathe we are not going to let no one get in the way
497327 ivins would have stood to make tens of thousands of dollars but not millions
497328 it will depend on the business arrangements that are in place
497329 i dont think he ever intended to kill anybody he just wanted to prove look this is possible he probably had no clue that it would aerosolize through those envelopes and kill those postal workers
497330 but the real satisfaction is knowing the vaccine is back on line
497331 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
497332 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
497333 we reached agreement on the need to take care of the iranian threat
497334 i left with a lot less questions marks than i had entered with regarding the means the timetable restrictions and american resoluteness to deal with the problem george bush understands the severity of the iranian threat and the need to vanquish it and intends to act on the matter before the end of his term in the white house
497335 i could probably drop a package of sweet n low and evacuate this building
497336 i want to look my fellow americans directly in the eye and declare to them i am not the anthrax killer
497337 i know nothing about the anthrax attacks i had absolutely nothing to do with this horrible crime
497338 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
497339 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions
497340 and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today
497341 but when it comes to reading in class it is hard

497343 tear into a can of the meanest energy supplement on the planet
497344 we went down into the lab and performed major surgery on the monster we hacked out the carbs and calories transplanted the wicked buzz and dialed in the flavor
497345 lo carb monster energy still delivers twice the buss of a regular energy drink but only has a fraction of the calories
497346 consume responsibly limit three cans per day not for children pregnant women or people sensitive to caffeine
497347 agreed on the right of lebanons people the army and the resistance to liberate all its territories
497348 the resistance cooperates with the army so that resistance weapons would have the freedom to defend the terrain and resist israel
497349 when we accepted this policy statement we approved it as a whole and we hope it would be fully applied but experience tells us that the policy statement in lebanon is mere headlines
497350 deals within the framework of partnership and cooperation and we have over passed the past and i believe that this policy statement has outlined the governments role
497351 this mornings events were not a terror attack they were the act of a sovereign state that attacked israel without reason and without provocation the government of lebanon of which hizbullah is a part is attempting to destabilize the region lebanon is the responsible party and lebanon will pay the consequences for its actions

497360 he was just an all around great guy he was never in a bad mood he always liked to have fun no one can ever replace him tim was one of a kind
497361 maybe those passengers will forget the incident one day for his friends and family this is one of the most tragic days of our lives
497362 but with the awesome response we have received twice in that area we feel the need to say thank you by not only delivering a great show but also supplying a great venue to host it

497373 certainly the rise in property values has seen a shift in the community
497374 whereas it used to be more arts and culture oriented now it is more diverse they the arts and culture types would represent the older part of the community and the newer part would be a variety of people from entrepreneurs to lawyers and so on
497375 ive always had the feeling that theres a very civil relationship and people care for each other as neighbours and feel very citizenly toward the park
497376 we do not ignore the people in the park theres probably more or less intimacy between neighbours

497441 men of israel listen to these words jesus the nazarene a man attested to you by god with miracles and wonders and signs which god performed through him in your midst just as you yourselves know this man delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of god you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put him to death but god raised him up again putting an end to the agony of death since it was impossible for him to be held in its power for david says of him i saw the lord always in my presence for he is at my right hand so that i will not be shaken therefore my heart was glad and my tongue exulted moreover my flesh also will live in hope because you will not abandon my soul to hades nor allow your holy one to undergo decay you have made known to me the ways of life you will make me full of gladness with your presence brethren i may confidently say to you regarding the patriarch david that he both died and was buried and his tomb is with us to this day and so because he was a prophet and knew that god had sworn to him with an oath to seat one of his descendants on his throne he looked ahead and spoke of the resurrection of the christ that he was neither abandoned to hades nor did his flesh suffer decay this jesus god raised up again to which we are all witnesses therefore having been exalted to the right hand of god and having received from the father the promise of the holy spirit he has poured forth this which you both see and hear for it was not david who ascended into heaven but he himself says the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i make your enemies a footstool for your feet therefore let all the house of israel know for certain that god has made him both lord and christ this jesus whom you crucified

497488 and frankly its good for brett because brett needs to stay part of football and obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
497489 i dont think it makes any sense for us to speculate
497490 we talked a lot about this and well just leave it at that
497491 i had the opportunity to speak to many athletes by all accounts this is the best olympic village ever it is really outstanding
497492 when beijing was awarded the games the ioc required them to provide media with the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games the ioc required this and this is what bocog has said it will do
497493 we are waiting to finalize this issue because we are still expecting potential news out of the balco case and this is an important thing to wait for
497494 it illustrates the degree to which doping simply will not be tolerated
497495 it is not our job to confirm the ages of all 10 500 athletes
497496 we had some discussion about a larger tire several years ago with nascar when we started this whole discussion about the car of tomorrow
497497 but obviously weve been working with the current size on the car of tomorrow this spring we decided to ramp that new program up
497498 we are working on a larger contain air volume a bigger section width taller tire larger bead diameter
497499 right now its all modeling were trying to figure out what the right size would be
497500 that was the most pathetic racing tire ive ever been on in my professional career
497501 let me ask you a question does my opinion really matter at the end of the day and if i had an opinion would it change anything probably not well let dale earnhardt jr do it but im not sure my opinion counts
497502 i am not in the best shape i am not at my highest level so it will take time for me to get better
497503 since i was a young girl its been my dream to become no 1 in the world
497504 were in a good position weve really done a great job this weekend

497506 kovalainen is pushing me hard but thats a good thing
497507 we didnt seem to be very strong this morning but looking at the lap times from the first two sessions i think we are there
497508 the lap wasnt perfect the traffic meant i couldnt prepare my tires
497509 he did a better job but im still in a good position i can imagine tomorrow i think it will be an interesting race
497510 the car wasnt too bad but i went off and couldnt stay on the circuit
497511 since i was a young girl it has been my dream to become number one in the world
497512 when you get older at least one day you can say you were number one and no one can take that away from you
497513 i cant write this sober but i can write it drunk
497514 he is like a former president just not one of the ones on the money
497515 from what happened in his last start its kind of hard to feel as confident as i was for the derby and those other races
497516 but i feel as confident as i can be that hes going to run his race
497517 im still kind of concerned about whats going to happen sunday because i know the horse went into the belmont in very good condition and whatever happened in that race i have no idea
497518 but if it happens again then im going to know something is wrong with him hes just not going to run anymore stuff like that you know
497519 big brown is the story and rightfully so and we hope our horses come to play and see what happens
497520 the trip was getting to him and i got into him pretty good
497521 i am not in the best shape i am not at my highest level so it will take time for me to get better

497533 we are not growing enough food and we cannot afford food the result is our sick children many other families hundreds of children like this are in our villages but cannot afford to come here

497538 right now its all modeling were trying to figure out what the right size would be
497539 that was the most pathetic racing tire ive ever been on in my professional career
497540 my guys would just push me off and i would put it in third gear
497541 my spotter did a good job of getting me onto the track where i didnt have to stop at the end of pit road again i dont think i would have gotten going at that point it really didnt affect the performance of the car it just made it a little frustrating and added some tension to the day

497590 el vuelco que ha dado la feb ha sido espectacular
497591 a m no me gusta perder la final contra rusia fue una oportunidad que dejamos pasar yo espero volver a tener una oportunidad as y aprovecharla la pr xima vez estados unidos llevan desde s dney sin lograr un oro y viene con respeto a estos juegos como nosotros les respetamos a ellos
497592 est claro que estados unidos va a presentar una gran selecci n se han dado cuenta de la importancia que tiene el baloncesto internacional y van a llevar a sus grandes jugadores pero nuestra selecci n est preparada para todo y si les ganamos seguro que lograremos una medalla
497593 hac a tiempo que no ven a con la selecci n y estoy muy contento de poder volver a ella es muy bonito poder disfrutar de una experiencia as poder volver a jugar con amigos los torneos ol mpicos siempre son dif ciles espa a s lo ha subido una vez al podio pero somos optimistas y vamos a ver hasta d nde podemos llegar
497594 ahora hay caras nuevas pero el talento es el mismo el feeling que tenemos sigue siendo el mismo a to es un t cnico consagrado tiene su filosof a y no nos ha costado demasiado adaptarnos a ella
497595 ahora somos tres bases diferentes unos de otros nos compaginamos bien yo creo que tenemos el equipo con m s talento de los ltimos a os con los jugadores que hay aqu casi cualquier sistema valdr a y los de a to son muy asequibles
497596 nosotros vamos con toda la ilusi n del mundo y con muchas ganas de hacerlo bien a todos los deportistas les gusta participar en unos juegos ol mpicos y nosotros queremos conseguir una medalla ol mpica y sumar la segunda para espa a tras los ngeles 1984
497597 el ambiente en este grupo siempre es bueno y eso es una de las cosas que m s atractivo hace venir cada verano a la selecci n que la gente que acude lo hace porque quiere nuestros resultados nos colocan entre los favoritos pero hay que dejar claro que a priori debemos tener respeto a todos los rivales desde el principio
497598 ir a los juegos es un sue o que hay que asimilar
497599 a n no tengo asimilado que ir a los juegos ol mpicos yo solo he estado entrenando y pensando en el trabajo diario a to es un gran entrenador que adem s tiene una virtud que no destaca a nadie por encima del resto trata a todos los jugadores por igual
497600 el formato del torneo es distinto al de otros a os y estamos en un grupo complicado as que iremos paso a paso aunque suene a topicazo es lo que hemos de hacer cualquier jugador que llega a la selecci n se adapta muy r pido a este equipo
497601 a m me gusta la forma en la que a to quiere que sus equipos se desenvuelvan en la cancha utiliza un sistema que hace pensar al jugador una filosof a que necesita que el jugador decida en la cancha que lea las jugadas y eso est bien
497602 lo m s positivo es que a los estados unidos no nos los encontraremos en el cruce como pas hace cuatro a os ni a china el anfitri n

497652 usually have no clue what is going on next door and have no wish to find out
497653 in the minds eye of non austrians the land of powder skiing avid recycling and gluhwein has morphed into the kind of place in which sordid things happen to children
497654 maybe in austria there is an undercurrent of playing at nazis and putting concentration camps in your basement
497655 an aversion to open conflict which has reached almost neurotic proportions
497656 locks out whistle blowers and malcontents as surely as josef fritzi locked up his daughter and children grandchildren
497657 it would be wrong of course to see a nazi lurking behind every floral patterned sofa in provincial austria but an amateur psychologist might draw the conclusion that 73 year old fritzi whose early childhood was spent in nazi austria came to accept certain patterns of behaviour
497658 perhaps austrians in rejecting the practice of denunciation that flourished under the nazis have become too ready to look the other way

497731 an episode where the boys investigate a haunting at one of the high schools they used to go to and then flashback to what the boys high school lives were like well sort of see them played by 18 year olds and giving people swirlies or whatever the hell they did i dont know yet we havent worked it out
497732 were not really going to see hell except in quick flashes and those types of moments
497733 there isnt going to be like fade in hell dean being poked with a pitchfork its going to be more about his return to earth and what that does to you psychologically hes still dean but deep in his soul hes been in the worst pow camp ever
497734 the boys have never been able to keep secrets from each other before not since season one when they were separate so to have a period of time where they were separate and they can surprise each other again has been really refreshing and fun to write
497735 i think sam and dean are both more individual or at least more heady
497736 theyve both done things in the last four months that theyre kind of worried about i think as we get into the meat of the season between episodes eight and fifteen were really going to delve into what sam did for those four months while dean was gone and the pain that hes gone through his brother was dead he buried his brother and then had to deal with it for a couple months and deal with it however you know he probably did some things he wasnt necessarily sure about and proud of hes definitely more hard edged
497737 for the first time theres a lot of story mythology centered around dean
497738 a lot of it was about sam and being psychic and whatever and now theres mysteries about each of them
497739 i always figured dean would come back otherwise its the sam winchester show
497740 i didnt know how and i didnt know why i always figured it would be that they find a way to get me out and that i would go back to just being dean and trying to save sam from whatever the demons had in store for him but now that ive come back and i cant figure out why or how its really starting to play into the psyche of dean and what hes going to go through and how thats going to involve himself into the mythology of not just sam but the entire show
497741 ill be the first to say when certain episodes or certain seasons suck but im really excited about this one
497742 were giggling like schoolgirls in the writers room we think were on to something this year i think we have some really really cool stuff in store
497743 lets charge you a lot but youll still get your money worth use yahoo and msn a lot
497744 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed

497759 could your holiness please explain why the result of karma is sometimes instant and why on other occasions we have to wait lifetimes before the causal effect occurs
497760 one factor would be the intensity of the karmic action itself another factor is the extent to which the various other conditions that are necessary for that karma to ripen are complete and this is dependent in turn on other karmic actions vasubandhu addressed this in the abhidharmakosha in which he states that generally speaking the karmic actions which are the most forceful tend to produce their effects first if the intensity of a karmic action is euqal to that of another karmic action then the result of the action with which the individual is most familiar tends to ripen first however if two karmic actions are equally forceful and equally familiar then the one that is committed earlier tends to produce its results first
497761 a second row start my first time out in superpole is fine with me the weather made for tricky conditions but we have got a good starting position and know we have decent race pace
497762 on my final quick lap i didnt push quite as hard as i might have i wanted to get a good starting position and once that was achieved i didnt want to risk a crash trying a little bit too hard for a couple more 10ths of a second there was still a damp line at stirlings
497763 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
497764 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
497765 i think that i would have preferred a gradual adjustment the fact that this is such a shock to american pocketbooks is not a good thing but if we take some steps right now to help people make the adjustment first of all by putting more money into their pockets but also by encouraging the market to adapt to these new circumstances more quickly particularly us automakers then i think ultimately we can come out of this stronger and have a more efficient energy policy than we do right now
497766 no esperaba encontrarme con nadie vivo al final del humero as que me qued muy sorprendido
497767 weve seen in past days that some of the bad skies were actually as much due to an amount of humidity in the air as anything else

497769 there is not a human being who would look at this person and say that she is not disabled
497770 we bought a mobile home and we thought we would be able to live in it comfortably for the rest of our lives
497771 it was more or less a warning to not get involved with the athletes until after the olympics
497772 they sent me an email saying we have always had good cooperation and thanks for everything you do for the ethiopian athletes but lately there has been tension within the team it was a request to keep a low profile
497773 we will continue to do what is best for our athletes and that should be what is best for the ethiopian federation

497780 it takes three days to get a jet ski license but akshay explained the time constraints he did a three day course in 12 hours he got up at 6 am and got his license by 7 pm
497781 he had to give a written and a practical test the action scene we have shot is one of the most expensive ones that bollywood has ever seen and has been directed by danny baldwin
497782 going through a theory and practical exam was like going back to school
497783 when we went for a reccee to australia we saw a lot of show reels and met a lot of technicians but we saw a clear synergy with danny as his style of action was exactly what we needed
497784 the beauty about the action in singh is kinng is that not only is it great to look at but makes the audience laugh as well
497785 it is similar only in quality these are very high end action sequences akshay had to be very careful in certain sequences for instance the scene in which he had to jump from one moving lift to another without supporting cables but akshay is akshay he did it with much panache and agility enjoy watching it in the film

497790 i was very afraid to leave their family because i was happy i had a family and i kept holding on to them all the time trying not to lose them
497791 it was the family that raised me that rescued me i also didnt want to leave poland i thought it was the country that let me live
497792 but i was 15 years old i was incredibly scared of the bombs i was no hero
497793 i think of my mother often because she was the dearest person in my life it stays with you all the time what you go through you cant throw it out of your memory
497794 my husband is very religious and doesnt especially care for the jews
497795 anytime he tried to say something against the jews i would tell him you forget who i am
497796 our march is a march for america not black america or white america
497797 with seven straight months of job losses with the highest percentage of homes in foreclosure since the depression with family incomes down 1 000 and the costs of gas groceries and health care up a whole lot more than that so many people are looking at their children wondering if theyll be able to give them the same chances they had
497798 the problems of our cities arent just urban problems any more
497799 you know that you cant take that seat at the front of the bus if you cant afford the bus fare you cant live in an integrated neighborhood if you cant afford the house and it doesnt mean a whole lot to sit down at that lunch counter if you cant afford the lunch
497800 i stand here before you today feeling no small amount of gratitude because i know that my story and so many other improbable stories would not be possible without all that the urban league has done to put opportunity within reach of every american
497801 we had a move the ball period at the end of the day a simulated game working on our substitutions and getting the coaches off the field its that time of year we also had a two minute drill we worked the final three plays of the game in desperation we did some good things today obviously we dropped a lot of balls we dropped too many passes today but the efforts good
497802 yeah it was a good spirited practice that was on the schedule i thought they responded and came out with good energy their assignments were solid we just didnt make enough plays especially on the offensive side of the ball when plays are there to be made youve got to make them
497803 no i dont have any updates other than guys are getting treatment i just think its great that when a player goes down the guy that steps in for him has to pick up the slack and play as good or better
497804 its family day and its a little over a week now that weve been here i try to keep things in perspective family comes first its a great opportunity to reunite with the wives of the players and to meet some of the new girlfriends that we have here with some of our single bachelors its a family atmosphere here and wed like to keep it that way i think its important that a man gets his space at some point and gets back to his family and thats what were doing this afternoon
497805 its not a bad place to have family day you can just drive across the street you can go to epcot you can go ride on the rock n roll rollercoaster which i recommend i like the buzz lightyear ride over at the disney park theres a lot to do here for kids
497806 he feels a lot better today he was walking around putting weight on it which is a great sign knowing him it wont be long what a great opportunity to get the other quarterbacks reps and it will pay off for us
497807 i like it a lot i really do we havent had a lot of reloaded plays where weve had busts of assignments were a deeper team i dont know if were a better team but weve got some competition and depth we need some guys to continue to perform at a level that they performed the first week the second week we challenged our team to play faster play with more execution eliminate the penalties and i thought for the most part we eliminated most of the today
497808 eighteen years i think ive been in the nfl and i think all 18 years bretts been in the nfl something like that 17 years not quite its quite a subject there are a lot of people putting a lot of miles in flying around to get stories hopefully it resolves itself soon its a bizarre unbelievable story and i enjoy the coverage i enjoy all the reporting that you guys have done keeping me up abreast as to whats happening up to speed i like it
497809 theyre doing well aqib talib is doing really well a lot of life and energy in his legs hes a playmaker he helps us dexter jackson is a little bit like joey most flights are canceled every day for a head coach we wanted speed and galloway and dexter jackson have speed we havent seen it yet its frustrating i think from that standpoint but dexters doing fine hes learning the offense i cant be more pleased with jeremy zuttah can not be more pleased hes unflappable hes doing an excellent job for the rest of the class weve got a long way to go but theyre working hard and were seeing improvement
497810 thinking you know this is not a game where you want to do too much thinking at that position youve got to get off the ball youve got to be disruptive and he is getting better i think hes getting in better shape the tempo and the speed of this game is probably a little bit foreign to him but he does have talent
497811 these results show how little time couples are actually making for each other and it looks like we are spending less time together than ever before challenging each other to do something new together is a great way to rejuvenate your relationship its all too easy for the demands of daily living to take precedence over being a couple but if people do not start making more quality time for each other whether its talking over the washing up or exercising together then the long term consequences could be serious
497812 its interesting to see how little time that couples are spending together these days its surprising to hear that 62 of those surveyed admitted they spend no time exercising as a couple either at a gym or outdoors running is not only a great way to keep fit and healthy but the perfect excuse to spend time together we hope that couples friends or even workmates will be really inspired by the pledge system to get active and challenge each other to run 10k together
497813 were going on were going strong and were going all the way
497814 we have nearly the same delegate lead as we did this morning and we are on our way to winning this nomination
497815 about picking a president who relies not just on words but on work on hard work to get america back to work
497816 its now important that we turn our attention not to what could have been or what we wanted to have been but what now must be and that is a united party
497817 stand up and fight for america for her strength her ideals and her future
497818 look i have said senator mccain will bring a lifetime of experience to the campaign i will bring a lifetime of experience and senator obama will bring a speech he made in 2002
497819 i think its imperative that each of us be able to demonstrate we can cross the commander in chief threshold
497820 i believe that ive done that certainly senator mccain has done that and youll have to ask senator obama with respect to his candidacy
497821 you wont see me as a vice presidential candidate you know im running for president
497822 we have won twice as many states as senator clinton and have a higher popular vote and i think we can maintain our delegate count
497823 ive got to know him well ive campaigned against him and with him
497824 determination to defeat an enemy and a heart big enough to love those who hurt
497825 i hope hell campaign for me as much as is in keeping with his busy schedule
497826 doctors advise melanoma patients to have regular checkups to detect new skin cancers and the spread of old ones because melanomas can be quirky
497827 but because such a test cannot be definitive the surgeons with mr mccains advance permission removed the surrounding lymph nodes and part of the parotid gland which produces saliva in the same operation which lasted five and a half hours
497828 and when i am the nominee the republicans wont be able to make this election about the past
497829 if you choose change you will have a nominee who doesnt just tell people what they want to hear
497830 poll tested positions calculated answers might be how washington confronts challenges but its not how you overcome those challenges its not how you inspire our nation to come together behind a common purpose and its not what america needs right now you need a candidate who will tell you the truth
497831 democrats will win in november and build a majority in congress not by nominating a candidate who will unite the other party against us but by choosing one who can unite this country around a movement for change
497832 it is time for new leadership that understands the way to win a debate with john mccain or any republican who is nominated is not by nominating someone who agreed with him on voting for the war in iraq or who agreed with him in voting to give george bush the benefit of the doubt on iran who agrees with him in embracing the bush cheney policy of not talking to leaders we dont like who actually differed with him by arguing for exceptions for torture before changing positions when the politics of the moment changed
497833 we need to offer the american people a clear contrast on national security and when i am the nominee of the democratic party that is exactly what i will do
497834 were going to win this nomination this nomination fight is going to go forward after ohio and texas were going to go to pennsylvania where a lot more americans are going to vote and were going to be the nominee in denver
497835 they nicholson and reiner decided to do this as something on their own to assist her campaign

497838 there is nothing on this earth sexier believe me gentlemen than a woman you have to salute in the morning
497839 yes i got a call they asked me to do something i explained to former president clinton that i admire a foot soldier but im too old to be one im not looking for so called followers im not that crazy about being interviewed i dont like the sound of my own voice after 20 minutes
497840 on the other hand i am irish i like being involved in the community as they say if you dont educate yourself about the political system youre doomed to be led by inferior people thats one of my fears
497841 food safety concerns have become a crucial public health issue perhaps most alarming of these is the questionable safety of many imported foods as the market for food becomes increasingly global and our population clamors for more fresh produce and uncooked ready to eat foods the microbiological risks of imported food have dramatically increased
497842 if the u s food safety system is allowed to continue unchanged there are likely to be major increases in the occurrence and size of foodborne outbreaks as u s food imports increase from countries in which risky food production harvesting and processing practices exist this issue is among the most serious of food safety concerns confronting americans for the foreseeable future this book is the first to provide a comprehensive treatment of the microbiological food safety issues facing the united states from imported foods and provides the justification for changes in the u s food safety net

497849 the government has stepped in to provide liquidity for federal student loan programs
497850 but with the average annual cost at 13 000 for an in state university and 32 000 for a private college there remains a sizable gap between what federal loans provide 3 500 to 5 500 per year and the true cost of an education
497851 excessive student indebtedness is serious but most financial experts consider student loans to be good debt since it is used to fund an investment that creates value over time
497852 its a bittersweet moment i so want some kind of resolution for my aunt

497854 alice hummel disappeared never to be heard from again after agreeing to confront her husband bruce hummel about his molestation of their 13 year old daughter
497855 the evidence clearly shows that bruce hummel had the motive and opportunity to murder alice hummel and in fact did so in october 1990
497856 i rowed and bailed for an hour and a half at least but the wind got worse and i had to let her body go

497858 it would be inherently cruel to move her to mexico
497859 weve grown up with jenny shes our family she deserves better than getting sent to a drive through tourist attraction in mexico
497860 jennys situation is of great concern to many people i represent
497861 this is not an indictment of the zoo in mexico but jenny deserves to be somewhere she will be happy
497862 we know she is a nervous elephant and with protected contact she can approach people if she wants to and we can monitor her stress levels easily without anyone getting hurt or killed
497863 these animals need our help to protect their natural habitat as well as facilitate conservation programs throughout the country that are helping new generations of wildlife stewards and conservationists

497867 today was a pretty good day for us second year head coach randy shannon said we got a lot of reps in and we re thrilled about all the season ticket holders coming out
497868 if you really love me so much come and embrace me now
497869 the policy at the moment is that you have to play in the previous competition to the all blacks team being named and by that we usually mean the super 14 before the tri nations or the air new zealand cup before the november tour
497870 the prospect of him coming back and playing for say otahuhu for two weeks before becoming an all black is not the way we do things
497871 so even if we relented and said were going to pick players from offshore we wouldnt get them now
497872 wed ended up picking two very different all blacks one for the iveco series in june and the november internationals because those are the two windows and another team for the tri nations because thats outside the window
497873 were not ignoring the possibility but at the moment theres a very clear policy not to do it
497874 were are very concerned by the advice we have received as to the date of the french final and thats a matter well be taking further
497875 we arent happy with it and well be speaking to the irb and the french about it as will the australians
497876 its too early to make a bullish statement about that but its a continuation of the issue around release of players from europe
497877 you and stephanie both go to yada yada high school
497878 the road to cutting record high fuel prices lies in a balanced long term energy policy that embraces conservation incentives for clean renewable energy and greater production of oil and gas here in america
497879 by lifting the ban on offshore energy exploration across the gulf and off mid atlantic states we bring more energy into u s markets this move in combination with conservation and renewable energy provides relief to consumers and increases americas independence from foreign oil
497880 its a little bit baffling i know they need the money but the symbolism of where hes going and what hes doing just reeks of why american voters want change
497881 if the democrats wish to take this opportunity to rehash statements made 18 years ago and use race for their own selfish political posturing then their priorities during this election season are out of line
497882 this facility is also much easier from a security standpoint which can be tricky when putting on this type of event and this cuts our cost

497885 the bush administration is increasing pressure on pakistans fledgling civilian government to bring the countrys spy service under civilian control according to american and pakistani officials during meetings in washington this week with pakistans prime minister yousaf raza gilani senior bush administration officials pressed their pakistani counterparts to assert control over inter services intelligence or isi the american officials said the pressure comes as relations between india and pakistan deteriorate following reports of isi involvement in the recent bombing of the indian embassy in kabul afghanistan the american pressure reflects heightened concerns at the state department pentagon and central intelligence agency that operatives in the isi who have long been believed to have close ties to pakistani militants have become bolder and more open in their support for militant islamist organizations

497892 we had a son who attended harvard for one year he loved harvard he was happy here but about a year ago he was accidentally killed my husband and i would like to erect a memorial to him somewhere on campus
497893 we cant put up a statue for every person who attended harvard and died if we did this place would look like a cemetery
497894 we dont want to erect a statue we thought we would like to give a building to harvard
497895 a building do you have any earthly idea how much a building costs we have over seven and a half million dollars in the physical buildings here at harvard
497896 her husband nodded the presidents face wilted in confusion and bewilderment
497897 well steadily tackle the most pressing tasks one by one and proceed with reforms taking into account the views of ordinary citizens
497898 im not going to lie to you im going to win this election i dont want to just win i want to give this guy who is running against me a spanking
497899 the reason i do is because he exemplifies the kind of scorched earth slash and burn negative campaign that has become the custom in washington and it is the reason why we cant get anything done
497900 ordinary people just dont act like that they dont call people names all the time they try to get something done it doesnt matter if you are a republican or a democrat youve got to be able to work with people to accomplish some common sense policies and make peoples lives a little bit better
497901 our idea is to prepare five members per booth to deal with the votes in that booth we would complete registrations and train the members in time for the state assembly elections in november
497902 the essence of the programme is to strengthen the panchayati raj institutions in the country
497903 a grand salon a throwback to new york of old
497904 ask the average guy if he knows or has heard of rubin chances are he has but not rattner
497905 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
497906 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
497907 for three decades ive heard speakers say things similar to what ive heard today thirty years ago they were called doomsdayers today we know enough to respect their opinions but we still havent changed our lifestyles i take good care of my clothes and they last a long time i have short cold showers and i dont own a car these solutions arent complex theyre right before every one of us
497908 green homes are shining through as the bright spot in an otherwise gloomy housing market
497909 this twin crisis of peak oil and climate change is spurring innovation experimentation and excitement
497910 these big challenges are what the u s is best at frankly
497911 by providing guidelines and strategies in essence our job is to keep saying yes its possible heres how
497912 there are a zillion different codes and standards out there
497913 we want to make it much easier for people to adopt our goals
497914 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
497915 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
497916 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
497917 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
497918 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
497919 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
497920 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
497921 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
497922 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
497923 right now i dont know if this is the real thing or not so i hope that tomorrow i can play just like i did today
497924 i felt i could play without pressure today compared to the last two days firstly because i followed my caddies advice and secondly because i think i have done everything i can to prepare
497925 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
497926 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
497927 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
497928 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
497929 water pow mlprice even the messiah seems to get it
497930 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
497931 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
497932 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
497933 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
497934 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
497935 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
497936 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
497937 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
497938 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
497939 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
497940 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
497941 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
497942 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
497943 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
497944 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
497945 you know gas prices are high when texans start driving golf carts
497946 part of a growing internet subculture with a fluid morality and a disdain for pretty much everyone else online
497947 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
497948 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
497949 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
497950 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
497951 its probably they were not planning to include conquest mode at all until they saw the feedback on these forums
497952 the game worked fine for me for over a month
497953 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
497954 lets not be naive senator obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
497955 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
497956 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
497957 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
497958 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of colour because theyre disproportionately uninsured
497959 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of colour because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
497960 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
497961 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
497962 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
497963 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
497964 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
497965 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
497966 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
497967 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
497968 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
497969 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
497970 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
497971 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
497972 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
497973 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
497974 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
497975 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
497976 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
497977 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
497978 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
497979 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
497980 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
497981 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
497982 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
497983 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
497984 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
497985 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
497986 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
497987 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
497988 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
497989 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
497990 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
497991 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
497992 but i resent when you throw out stupid allegations that have no merit and really no purpose other than to inflame
497993 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father rom 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body rom 9 4 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises gal 4 5 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons eph 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will
497994 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
497995 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
497996 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
497997 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
497998 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
497999 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
498000 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
498001 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
498002 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
498003 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
498004 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
498005 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
498006 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
498007 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
498008 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
498009 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
498010 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
498011 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
498012 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
498013 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
498014 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
498015 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
498016 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
498017 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
498018 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
498019 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
498020 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
498021 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
498022 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
498023 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
498024 food workers at the shelbyville tenn plant for tyson foods which boasts on its corporate website that it strives to honor god will have time off for eid al fitr the muslim holiday closing the month of ramadan instead of the american tradition labor day officials with the company told wnd the labor union representing the 1 200 plant workers including about 700 immigrants from somalia who largely are muslim sought the holiday change in the new five year contract and the company agreed
498025 contract that creates an additional paid holiday eid al fitr a muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of ramadan
498026 because of my adhd i bounce i wiggle and i can never sit still
498027 before i started at kaplan i thought these were all bad things now i see them as perks as a part of who i am and as tools i can use to help not only myself but also my family my friends and those around me i have learned how to use my adhd to get things done
498028 kaplan university is changing the world of education as we know it we push the limits of whats possible
498029 each of you graduating today is proof of whats possible in your own lives you clearly have the drive and determination to break through barriers and seize opportunities to make a difference for yourselves personally and professionally this graduating class is the embodiment of whats possible when you pursue education

498031 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
498032 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
498033 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
498034 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
498035 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
498036 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
498037 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
498038 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
498039 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
498040 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
498041 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
498042 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
498043 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
498044 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
498045 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
498046 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
498047 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
498048 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
498049 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
498050 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
498051 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
498052 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
498053 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
498054 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
498055 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
498056 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
498057 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
498058 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
498059 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
498060 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
498061 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
498062 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
498063 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
498064 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
498065 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
498066 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
498067 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
498068 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
498069 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
498070 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
498071 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
498072 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
498073 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
498074 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
498075 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
498076 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
498077 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
498078 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
498079 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
498080 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
498081 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
498082 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
498083 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
498084 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
498085 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
498086 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
498087 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
498088 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
498089 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
498090 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
498091 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
498092 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
498093 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
498094 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
498095 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
498096 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
498097 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
498098 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
498099 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
498100 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
498101 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
498102 if the vice president says its do able i believe
498103 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
498104 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
498105 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
498106 nos repugna que de juana est en la calle pero creemos en la ley
498107 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
498108 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
498109 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
498110 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
498111 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
498112 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
498113 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
498114 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
498115 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
498116 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
498117 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
498118 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
498119 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
498120 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
498121 six gun sound the early history of the los angeles county sheriffs department
498122 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
498123 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
498124 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
498125 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
498126 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
498127 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
498128 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
498129 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
498130 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
498131 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
498132 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
498133 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
498134 russell mesler is a lawrence resident and an emeritus professor in kansas universitys department of chemical and petroleum engineering
498135 bozo your ad hominem comment directed against professor mesler is not only out of line
498136 were spending 1 trillion a year on the war department
498137 where does uranium fuel come from canada australia the former soviet union and africa the last time i checked how does this make us less reliant on foreign sources how long is the uranium supply supposed to last at current consumption 50 years
498138 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
498139 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
498140 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
498141 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
498142 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
498143 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
498144 asbestos and the columnist talked about the subsidies that wind gets
498145 they just got 10 billion taxpayer dollars in the energy policy act of 2005 to jumpstart the moribund industry and utilities were given until the end of 2008 to sign up for a new nuke and qualify for the huge taxbreaks cost sharing and risk insurance protection in the package
498146 sorry dude but that was the point of the article there is only 386
498147 1 3 wind turbines will not produce power efficiently below a wind speed of 15mph they must be disengaged at wind speeds over 50mph to prevent damage to the turbine they also require a fairly demanding amount of maintenance
498148 wind and pv systems should be installed in every house in the united states for those people that want to participate to offset their energy bill
498149 enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
498150 thus what gore offered july 17 was not so much a
498151 of course the greatest obstacle to meeting the challenge may be the deep dysfunction of our politics and our self governing system as it exists today in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
498152 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
498153 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
498154 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
498155 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
498156 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
498157 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
498158 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
498159 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
498160 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
498161 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
498162 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
498163 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
498164 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
498165 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
498166 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
498167 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
498168 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
498169 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
498170 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
498171 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
498172 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
498173 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
498174 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
498175 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
498176 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
498177 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
498178 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
498179 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
498180 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
498181 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
498182 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
498183 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
498184 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
498185 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
498186 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
498187 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
498188 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
498189 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
498190 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
498191 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
498192 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
498193 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
498194 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
498195 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
498196 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
498197 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
498198 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
498199 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
498200 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
498201 there are roughly 225 000 more people living with hiv in the u s than previously suspected
498202 if you are a young gay black man the likelihood that you will encounter hiv is staggeringly high even if your personal behavior is no more risky than people in other communities
498203 the united states can be proud of having more than tripled its remarkable commitment to the global hiv aids epidemic
498204 these new figures from cdc demonstrate that the domestic epidemic needs a similar response
498205 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by the cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the u s hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease
498206 are one of the most severely impacted groups in the world
498207 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
498208 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
498209 whether its sept 1 that might be stretching a little bit but i still think were going to get him back

498215 falcon 1 take 3 today at 4 00 pacific time
498216 weve been able to come up with a java applet that for all intents and purposes is an image
498217 the attack is going to work best wherever you leave yourself logged in for long periods of time
498218 there will be other ways to do this with other technologies
498219 in the long term web applications are going to have to take control of the content
498220 its a web application issue the java attack that were currently using is just one vector
498221 its that browser security is broken browser security is really an oxymoron
498222 apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the protocol weakness
498223 with active exploit code available in a common attack tool it is imperative that apple fix this vulnerability
498224 due to their involvement in the process and the ability of other vendors to fix their products in a timely fashion its hard to imagine any possible justification for apples tardy behavior

498228 when you dont find a job you try to find something to occupy your mind because you go nuts because youre thinking about you should be out there doing what you got to do
498229 teams want to go with youth and stay within the organization
498230 but dont complain if youre not going to win because there are guys out there that can still play
498231 we have to make sure we dont forget about him
498232 like i said earlier paulie is a big part of the ballclub
498233 i dont want to put guys on the shelf and forget about it everybody is going to have playing time
498234 i dont want to put pressure on like a guy has to get a hit every day to play
498235 but ill continue to mix it around and see how things work
498236 i told them both i wanted to try this and if it wasnt good for either one of them that i would have to make a decision so thats what we did
498237 it was kind of getting to both of them a little bit i just think that its better to do it this way
498238 i was working more on mechanics and keeping my endurance up not focusing on improving the starts itll be good to do a regular session for now
498239 hes such a gym rat and he likes to have his routine down to a science and more power to him
498240 hes extremely prepared every five days mentally and physically i think starting might be better suited for him because of his makeup
498241 i always look at the bullpen as a promotion because now they can throw three or four times a week instead of once
498242 i want to be part of this team and i want to participate in the games that matter i just dont want to clean up
498243 im disappointed and disappointed is a strong word but its just part of it i want to be on this team i want to help this team win im upset but man what can you do i cant put myself in a situation where im not ready to handle another opportunity
498244 we thought that by alternating starts we could keep them both sharp both stretched out but its just the makeup of the schedule that it doesnt quite work that way
498245 well watch him day to day and see what direction it goes its a little sore today right now its day to day well see tomorrow how he feels
498246 that could have been bad any time you get a line drive particularly pitching we were a little concerned but he felt good enough to continue and feels fine today
498247 we both want to do whatever we can to help the team win thats what matters
498248 we destroyed about 111 local refineries and we are going to destroy more
498249 these illegal refineries are in almost every village in bomadi and burutu local government areas
498250 were undergoing minor repairs in warri at the time of the attack
498251 we need real time intelligence for us to cope well with the task
498252 the price we pay is very high it is difficult to get expatriates to work in the niger delta we paid militants 12 million in two months because we are losing 81 million to the problem of chanomi pipeline in delta state
498253 disassociates itself from the nigerian national petroleum corporation nnpc payment claim of 12 million to militants for pipeline protection as stated by its group managing director abubakar lawal yaradua
498254 this gang is not a genuine part of the niger delta agitation they can not be labeled as militant freedom fighters
498255 mend will never sell its birthright for a bowl of porridge when the impoverished masses in the region continue to live in abject poverty it is for refusing such bribes that henry okah is still being held captive today to prove that we are not a part of this deal the chanomi creek pipeline and other major pipelines will be destroyed within the next 30 days
498256 we did not pay mend or any militant group all we did was to award the pipeline repairs contract to a community based company and some community group who assured us that they can protect the lines were also engaged by the corporation
498257 the details should be in the handover notes to engr yaradua by his predecessor he should check and find out who collected the money and for what but if you are talking about the repairs of the chanomi crude oil pipeline i am aware that fenog was paid 105 000
498258 this 12 million thing is a deal between some top officials of the nnpc and some people who claimed that they would protect the pipelines
498259 if it is a militant leader that collected the money nigerians want to know they want to know if he came to the nnpc to collect the money in cash or a cheque was issued to him which bank did he cash it and what for
498260 the searchlight is not on the nnpc alone they should ask the people that handled the matter at the petroleum products and marketing company ppmc questions and hand them over to the economic and financial crimes commission efcc once the culprits are identified because this is clearly a scam
498261 it is a company that did the job not a militant group there is no way a contract can be awarded to a militant group that is very clear whoever collected the money did so in the name of a company
498262 when tension died down the nnpc approached the communities that they wanted to effect repairs one of the oil companies and the nnpc had even gone to some other places and paid money to secure the pipeline before they came to the communities
498263 when they came to us we told them that they should go and settle with the militants who blew up the pipeline in the first instance so that they would not come again when they would be repairing it we are only host communities we did not see 12m they should identify those the money was paid to
498264 as for the crude oil pipeline it was julius berger that was to do the repairs but because the company had refused to do a road contract in the creek which the communities wanted the delta state government to award to it some aggrieved youths insisted that they would not allow the company to carry out the repairs on the pipeline if it would not handle the road project
498265 it appears that fenog was brought in by another company i cant remember the name of the company that was to do the job fenog must have done a job for the nnpc and because they were satisfied with its performance the firm was awarded a contract to carry out the repairs the company cooperated with the communities and it had no problem whatsoever in doing its job they did not hire houseboats as some companies do they lived with the people in the communities where they were working and they made the villagers to like them
498266 when some indian workers were kidnapped by a criminal gang in the state a staff of the niger benue transport company nbtc mr daniel tishene was abducted the dwsc intervened and ensured their release without paying ransom to the kidnappers it has also facilitated the return of companies to the state and helped the joint task force jtf on the niger delta in recovering the weapons seized from its men by a militant group the underdogs without paying money to the group
498267 the fact is that the gmd of the nnpc gave the true detail of what happened any other statement after that by the nnpc is damage control using a company as a cover is not new in perfecting a fraud in nigeria
498268 as for the group we referred to as criminals they are not mend we are aware they have usurped a legitimate struggle and turned it into an enterprise there is so much to be done other than expecting some generators in a community or other myopic expectations our agitation is bigger than that
498269 we started the struggle and we are still in the struggle dont mind them when they say or do anything they like in the name of mend that is what landed henry okah in trouble
498270 cmon buddy another 30 minutes of shut eye will help
498271 were a team you and me body and brain brain shuts down so that body can sleep and then tomorrow we go kick some ass
498272 what would you say if i told you that you were the source of my greatest joy and my greatest sorrow
498273 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own

498275 what smith did was wrong and we take very serious and he is being punished severely for it
498276 he knows what those are and we will move forward
498277 ken got overwhelmed with every single player coming up to him and telling him hello
498278 i think it was great that he came out today a lesser person would not have come out but he did and we cant wait to get him back
498279 i know hes extremely remorseful and he understands but if we want to be a good football team we have to win without him
498280 i know that fear is a powerful motivator but this drumbeat of catastrophe has made it harder to discuss the sensible concerns raised during public meetings

498288 thank you for replacing my infected bone it was like a new seed sown it can be increased in height as i grow dont you think before this modern technology we all must bow i owe you some chocolates for sparing me the pain though i lost the bet it was my gain
498289 though affordable and effective the surgery is disfiguring which is why only 20 patients needing treatment opt for it
498290 i went for rotationplasty five years ago and have been living a normal life
498291 yes it looks odd but very few have actually seen my leg after surgery
498292 people from far flung areas used to throng our home to see my leg making me feel like an animal in a circus
498293 i was shattered with the diagnosis i wanted to be a cricketer and dreaded the thought of losing a leg my family didnt have the money for a prosthetic implant so when we went for rotationplasty on the doctors advice i was thrilled
498294 i still play cricket though i need a runner sometimes
498295 prabal has no deformity and is growing and developing normally
498296 special rights are only in the field of economics not sports should we use strings to make malays good at high jump
498297 dr ismail would even arrest his own mother if she broke the law he exemplifies the kind of leader we need today
498298 tun dr ismail was a pivotal player in our nations history yet younger malaysians know more about taman tun the housing area than the man himself he was made of the stuff of heroes
498299 its not all song and dance as there will also be some dialogue its a serious musical with some comic moments
498300 ive had to restrain my own naturally melodramatic acting style dr ismail was a man of few words he did not believe in protocol or sucking up he wanted political support not because he shook somebodys hand but because of his ideas
498301 he promoted equality between the races and wanted the nep new economic policy to be limited to 20 years so that malays would step up to the plate
498302 thats the real tragedy of our history education it was only after reading up that i realised he was the conscience of this country
498303 look here i am here not as a representative of umno but as minister of home affairs whatever i do is based on the rule of law i am closer to this boy than any of you but this must be done
498304 people of that generation really worked for the good of the country its like how americans look back at 16th us president abraham lincoln who led the country through the civil war with such pride in dr ismail we also had a giant for a leader i only hope we see more such people in our time
498305 a factual representation of the spirit of dr ismail what he stood for
498306 you keep your hands locked up and just write what is jolly
498307 if we dont kill this thing of race race will kill us all for sure
498308 in a way dr ismail was involved in a love triangle between razak and neno between his love for the country and his wife
498309 reputed in kuala lumpur for their flair and love for dancing
498310 whereas in malaya people loiter about towns their idle minds thinking of mischief
498311 at first i thought it would be the typical rtm stuff
498312 but i was surprised that his music has an impish sense of humour sometimes its 1970s and then suddenly it becomes like les miserables
498313 in our youth we plucked the stars of the universe
498314 how did we come to this where did we falter
498315 my friend the united merdeka people we dreamt of remains a distant truth my anger becomes bitterness when we are forced apart the distance ever wider now that i am proclaimed bumiputra and you not when can we extinguish the racial differences that burn us and the blazing petrol poured by those who are two faced when can all citizens get equal rights treatment and justice and be known by one name bangsa malaysia
498316 had he not died prematurely malaysia would have been different and the rule of law would not have suffered any reversal and would have continued to safeguard the freedom and liberty of all citizens
498317 i chose our neighborhood as it was a safe place to live when this happened my wife and i carefully discussed what we should do we decided for the first time to get a gun for self protection
498318 when a crime happens to someone suddenly they come in scared and wanting a gun right now with a bad economy crime rises and then people want to be armed theres been some 40 percent increase in concealed weapons carried since january
498319 the most essential factor is persistence the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by the discouragement that must inevitably come
498320 i do a great deal of research particularly in the apartments of tall blondes
498321 i can help if i get to them early enough
498322 england made us play really hard we didnt bowl as well yesterday and they put us under pressure and we had to come up with something special which we did
498323 i think england made us fight for this one we had to work hard at headingley and show a lot of discipline there to go 1 0 up which is the key in trying to get it sewn up before the last one
498324 i think if england had won this one the oval would have been very difficult for us
498325 id like to think it was my best knock in the colours in terms of the meaning that comes with it
498326 we had a very young side especially in the first half and played well we were unlucky to concede the goal and maybe lacked a bit of experience to score as well as some physical match sharpness there were some heavy legs but it will get better over the next two weeks
498327 do not be impressed by his small size because he is not phased by the physical challenges
498328 i feel our fans are behind him i feel that was more disappointed love to me face to face he always told me he wants to stay at the club and it finished like that so i believe what he told me he is not going anywhere even if you come with a 747 plane full of money
498329 we are not close to signing anybody and i will focus on the players i have if we can find someone then we will do it if not i am happy as well
498330 experience wise we a bit short in midfield but we will see with diaby not being injured denilson being available we have quality in there today we did not have rosicky fabregas eduardo van persie and song they are five top class players
498331 last year we were really really unlucky we were only four points adrift and lost only three games in two of those we were leading 1 0 until 15 minutes before the end we also got some bad injuries
498332 we need to strengthen belief not only in the way we play but the way we work we must keep complete confidence in these young players

498389 for richer or poorer and in sickness and in health
498390 i have ordained on this earth days and years and thou and thy seed shall dwell and walk in it until the days and years are fulfilled when i shall send the word that created thee and against which thou hast transgressed the word that made thee come out of the garden and that raised thee when thou wast fallen 2 yea the word that will again save thee when the five days and a half are fulfilled
498391 lord thou didst send me to watch at the gate of the garden with a sword of fire
498392 but when thy servants adam and eve saw me they fell on their faces and were as dead o my lord what shall we do to thy servants
498393 i told thee that at the end of five days and a half i will send my word and save thee
498394 strengthen thy heart therefore and abide in the cave of treasures of which i have before spoken to thee
498395 look at this cave that is to be our prison in this world and a place of punishment
498396 what is it compared with the garden what is its narrowness compared with the space of the other
498397 what is this rock by the side of those groves what is the gloom of this cavern compared with the light of the garden
498398 what is this overhanging ledge of rock to shelter us compared with the mercy of the lord that overshadowed us
498399 what is the soil of this cave compared with the garden land this earth strewed with stones and that planted with delicious fruit trees
498400 look at thine eyes and at mine which afore beheld angels in heaven praising and they too without ceasing
498401 but now we do not see as we did our eyes have become of flesh they cannot see in like manner as they saw before
498402 what is our body to day compared to what it was in former days when we dwelt in the garden
498403 unless i enter the cave i shall again be a transgressor
498404 o god forgive me my sin the sin which i committed and remember it not against me
498405 for i alone caused thy servant to fall from the garden into this lost estate from light into this darkness and from the abode of joy into this prison
498406 o god look upon this thy servant thus fallen and raise him from his death that he may weep and repent of his transgression which he committed through me
498407 take not away his soul this once but let him live that he may stand after the measure of his repentance and do thy will as before his death
498408 but if thou do not raise him up then o god take away my own soul that i be like him and leave me not in this dungeon one and alone for i could not stand alone in this world but with him only
498409 for thou o god didst cause a slumber to come upon him and didst take a bone from his side and didst restore the flesh in the place of it by thy divine power
498410 and thou didst take me the bone and make me a woman bright like him with heart reason and speech and in flesh like unto his own and thou didst make me after the likeness of his countenance by thy mercy and power
498411 o lord i and he are one and thou o god art our creator thou are he who made us both in one day
498412 therefore o god give him life that he may be with me in this strange land while we dwell in it on account of our transgression
498413 but if thou wilt not give him life then take me even me like him that we both may die the same day
498414 you transgressed of your own free will until you came out of the garden in which i had placed you
498415 of your own free will have you transgressed through your desire for divinity greatness and an exalted state such as i have so that i deprived you of the bright nature in which you then were and i made you come out of the garden to this land rough and full of trouble
498416 if only you had not transgressed my commandment and had kept my law and had not eaten of the fruit of the tree near which i told you not to come and there were fruit trees in the garden better than that one
498417 but the wicked satan who continued not in his first estate nor kept his faith in whom was no good intent towards me and who though i had created him yet set me at naught and sought the godhead so that i hurled him down from heaven he it is who made the tree appear pleasant in your eyes until you ate of it by hearkening to him
498418 thus have you transgressed my commandment and therefore have i brought upon you all these sorrows
498419 for i am god the creator who when i created my creatures did not intend to destroy them but after they had sorely roused my anger i punished them with grievous plagues until they repent
498420 but if on the contrary they still continue hardened in their transgression they shall be under a curse for ever
498421 o adam i have made my covenant with thee and i will not turn from it neither will i let thee return to the garden until my covenant of the great five days and a half is fulfilled
498422 o lord thou didst create us and make us fit to be in the garden and before i transgressed thou madest all beasts come to me that i should name them
498423 thy grace was then on me and i named every one according to thy mind and thou madest them all subject unto me
498424 but now o lord god that i have transgressed thy commandment all beasts will rise against me and will devour me and eve thy handmaid and will cut off our life from the face of the earth
498425 i therefore beseech thee o god that since thou hast made us come out of the garden and hast made us be in a strange land thou wilt not let the beasts hurt us
498426 o god when we dwelt in the garden and our hearts were lifted up we saw the angels that sang praises in heaven but now we do not see as we were used to do nay when we entered the cave all creation became hidden from us
498427 when thou wast under subjection to me thou hadst a bright nature within thee and for that reason couldst thou see things afar off but after thy transgression thy bright nature was withdrawn from thee and it was not left to thee to see things afar off but only near at hand after the ability of the flesh for it is brutish
498428 why hast thou brought upon me upon thyself and upon our seed so many of these plagues and punishments
498429 what is it thou hast seen to weep and to speak to me in this wise
498430 seest thou not this water that was with us in the garden that watered the trees of the garden and flowed out thence
498431 and we when we were in the garden did not care about it but since we came to this strange land we love it and turn it to use for our body
498432 o god while we were in the garden we did not require or care for this water but since we came to this land we cannot do without it
498433 while thou wast under my command and wast a bright angel thou knewest not this water
498434 but after that thou hast transgressed my commandment thou canst not do without water wherein to wash thy body and make it grow for it is now like that of beasts and is in want of water
498435 i have made thee a promise when that promise is fulfilled i will bring thee back into the garden thee and thy righteous seed
498436 we shall not drink of this water even if we were to die o eve when this water comes into our inner parts it will increase our punishments and that of our children that shall come after us
498437 remember the bright nature in which we lived while we abode in the garden
498438 o eve remember the glory that rested on us in the garden o eve remember the trees that overshadowed us in the garden while we moved among them
498439 o eve remember that while we were in the garden we knew neither night nor day
498440 think oh think of that garden in which was no darkness while we dwelt therein
498441 whereas no sooner did we come into this cave of treasures than darkness compassed us round about until we can no longer see each other and all the pleasure of this life has come to an end
498442 o god wherefore has light departed from us and darkness come over us wherefore dost thou leave us in this long darkness why wilt thou plague us thus
498443 and this darkness o lord where was it ere it came upon us it is such that we cannot see each other
498444 for so long as we were in the garden we neither saw nor even knew what darkness is i was not hidden from eve neither was she hidden from me until now that she cannot see me and no darkness came upon us to separate us from each other
498445 but she and i were both in one bright light i saw her and she saw me yet now since we came into this cave darkness has come upon us and parted us asunder so that i do not see her and she does not see me
498446 o lord wilt thou then plague us with this darkness
498447 o adam so long as the good angel was obedient to me a bright light rested on him and on his hosts
498448 but when he transgressed my commandment i deprived him of that bright nature and he became dark
498449 and when he was in the heavens in the realms of light he knew naught of darkness
498450 but he transgressed and i made him fall from heaven upon the earth and it was this darkness that came upon him
498451 and on thee o adam while in my garden and obedient to me did that bright light rest also
498452 but when i heard of thy transgression i deprived thee of that bright light yet of my mercy i did not turn thee into darkness but i made thee thy body of flesh over which i spread this skin in order that it may bear cold and heat
498453 if i had let my wrath fall heavily upon thee i should have destroyed thee and had i turned thee into darkness it would have been as if i killed thee
498454 but in my mercy i have made thee as thou art when thou didst transgress my commandment o adam i drove thee from the garden and made thee come forth into this land and commanded thee to dwell in this cave and darkness came upon thee as it did upon him who transgressed my commandment
498455 thus o adam has this night deceived thee it is not to last for ever but is only of twelve hours when it is over daylight will return
498456 sigh not therefore neither be moved and say not in thy heart that this darkness is long and drags on wearily and say not in thy heart that i plague thee with it
498457 strengthen thy heart and be not afraid this darkness is not a punishment but o adam i have made the day and have placed the sun in it to give light in order that thou and thy children should do your work
498458 for i knew thou shouldest sin and transgress and come out into this land yet would i not force thee nor be heard upon thee nor shut up nor doom thee through thy fall nor through thy coming out from light into darkness nor yet through thy coining from the garden into this land
498459 for i made thee of the light and i willed to bring out children of light from thee and like unto thee
498460 but thou didst not keep one day my commandment until i had finished the creation and blessed everything in it
498461 then i commanded thee concerning the tree that thou eat not thereof yet i knew that satan who deceived himself would also deceive thee
498462 so i made known to thee by means of the tree not to come near him and i told thee not to eat of the fruit thereof nor to taste of it nor yet to sit under it nor to yield to it
498463 had i not been and spoken to thee o adam concerning the tree and had i left thee without a commandment and thou hadst sinned it would have been an offence on my part for not having given thee any order thou wouldst turn round and blame me for it
498464 but i commanded thee and warned thee and thou didst fall so that my creatures cannot blame me but the blame rests on them alone
498465 and o adam i have made the day for thee and for thy children after thee for them to work and toil therein and i have made the night for them to rest in it from their work and for the beasts of the field to go forth by night and seek their food
498466 but little of darkness now remains o adam and daylight will soon appear
498467 o lord take thou my soul and let me not see this gloom any more or remove me to some place where there is no darkness
498468 verily i say unto thee this darkness will pass from thee every day i have determined for thee until the fulfilment of my covenant when i will save thee and bring thee back again into the garden into the abode of light thou longest for wherein is no darkness i will bring thee to it in the kingdom of heaven
498469 all this misery that thou hast been made to take upon thee because of thy transgression will not free thee from the hand of satan and will not save thee
498470 but i will when i shall come down from heaven and shall become flesh of thy seed and take upon me the infirmity from which thou sufferest then the darkness that came upon thee in this cave shall come upon me in the grave when i am in the flesh of thy seed
498471 and i who am without years shall be subject to the reckoning of years of times of months and of days and i shall be reckoned as one of the sons of men in order to save thee
498472 o lord plague me not neither consume me nor yet take away my life from the earth
498473 o adam arise and stand up this sun is not god but it has been created to give light by day of which i spake unto thee in the cave saying that the dawn would break forth and there would be light by day
498474 but i am god who comforted thee in the night
498475 o adam because of thee and of eve i am slippery and go upon my belly
498476 in the first instance i made thee glib and made thee to go upon thy belly but i did not deprive thee of speech
498477 now however be thou dumb and speak no more thou and thy race because in the first place has the ruin of my creatures happened through thee and now thou wishest to kill them
498478 o lord when i was in the cave i said this to thee my lord that the beasts of the field would rise and devour me and cut off my life from the earth
498479 o adam not one of these beasts will be able to hurt thee because when i made the beasts and other moving things come to thee in the cave i did not let the serpent come with them lest it should rise against you make you tremble and the fear of it should fall into your hearts
498480 for i knew that that accursed one is wicked therefore would i not let it come near you with the other beasts
498481 but now strengthen thy heart and fear not i am with thee unto the end of the days i have determined on thee
498482 o god remove us to some other place that the serpent may not come again near us and rise against us lest it find thy handmaid eve alone and kill her for its eyes are hideous and evil
498483 henceforth fear not i will not let it come near you i have driven it away from you from this mountain neither will i leave in it aught to hurt you
498484 i wish not to live after him for all that he did to himself was through me
498485 o adam all this misery which thou hast wrought upon thyself will not avail against my rule neither will it alter the covenant of the 5500 years
498486 i wither in the heat i am faint from walking and am loth of this world and i know not when thou wilt bring me out of it to rest
498487 o adam it cannot be at present not until thou hast ended thy days then shall i bring thee out of this wretched land
498488 while i was in the garden i knew neither heat nor languor neither moving about nor trembling nor fear but now since i came to this land all this affliction has come upon me
498489 so long as thou wast keeping my commandment my light and my grace rested on thee but when thou didst transgress my commandment sorrow and misery befell thee in this land
498490 o lord do not cut me off for this neither smite me with heavy plagues nor yet repay me according to my sin for we of our own will did transgress thy commandment and forsook thy law and sought to become gods like unto thee when satan the enemy deceived us
498491 because thou hast borne fear and trembling in this land languor and suffering treading and walking about going upon this mountain and dying from it i will take all this upon myself in order to save thee
498492 o god have mercy on me so far as to take upon thee that which i will do
498493 but when we came into this strange land pure praise was no longer ours nor righteous prayer nor understanding hearts nor sweet thoughts nor just counsels nor long discernment nor upright feelings neither is our bright nature left us
498494 yet now look upon our blood which is offered upon these stones and accept it at our hands like the praise we used to sing unto thee at first when in the garden
498495 o adam as thou hast shed thy blood so will i shed my own blood when i become flesh of thy seed and as thou didst die o adam so also will i die
498496 and as thou didst sue for forgiveness through that blood so also will i make my blood forgiveness of sins and blot out transgressions in it
498497 and now behold i have accepted thy offering o adam but the days of the covenant wherein i have bound thee are not fulfilled when they are fulfilled then will i bring thee back into the garden
498498 now therefore strengthen thy heart and when sorrow comes upon thee make me an offering and i will be favourable to thee
498499 o adam do not again kill thyself as thou didst by throwing thyself down from that mountain
498500 it was in my mind to put an end to myself at once for having transgressed thy commandments and for my having come out of the beautiful garden and for the bright light of which thou hast deprived me and for the praises which poured forth from my mouth without ceasing and for the light that covered me
498501 yet of thy goodness o god do not away with me altogether but be favourable to me every time i die and bring me to life
498502 and thereby it will be made known that thou art a merciful god who willest not that one should perish who lovest not that one should fall and who dost not condemn any one cruelly badly and by whole destruction
498503 when we were on the mountain we were comforted by the word of god that conversed with us and the light that came from the east shone over us
498504 but now the word of god is hidden from us and the light that shone over us is so changed as to disappear and let darkness and sorrow come upon us
498505 and we are forced to enter this cave which is like a prison wherein darkness covers us so that we are parted from each other and thou canst not see me neither can i see thee
498506 adam as for the sun if i were to take it and bring it to thee days hours years and months would all come to naught and the covenant i have made with thee would never be fulfilled
498507 but thou shouldest then be turned and left in a long plague and no salvation would be left to thee for ever
498508 yea rather bear long and calm thy soul while thou abidest night and day until the fulfilment of the days and the time of my covenant is come
498509 then shall i come and save thee o adam for i do not wish that thou be afflicted
498510 and when i look at all the good things in which thou didst live and why thou camest out of them then would i willingly show thee mercy
498511 but i cannot alter the covenant that has gone out of my mouth else would i have brought thee back into the garden
498512 when however the covenant is fulfilled then shall i show thee and thy seed mercy and bring thee into a land of gladness where there is neither sorrow nor suffering but abiding joy and gladness and light that never fails and praises that never cease and a beautiful garden that shall never pass away
498513 be long suffering and enter the cave for the darkness of which thou wast afraid shall only be twelve hours long and when ended light shall arise
498514 look at that great light and at those many songs of praise and at that host standing outside that do not come in to us do not tell us what they say or whence they come or what is the meaning of this light what those praises are wherefore they have been sent hither and why they do not come in
498515 if they were from god they would come to us in the cave and would tell us their errand
498516 o lord is there in the world another god than thou who created angels and filled them with light and sent them to keep us who would come with them
498517 but lo we see these hosts that stand at the mouth of the cave they are in a great light they sing loud praises if they are of some other god than thou tell me and if they are sent by thee inform me of the reason for which thou hast sent them
498518 o adam fear not this is satan and his hosts he wishes to deceive you as he deceived you at first for the first time he was hidden in the serpent but this time he is come to you in the similitude of an angel of light in order that when you worshipped him he might enthrall you in the very presence of god
498519 this hideous form has been his ever since god made him fall from heaven he could not have come near you in it therefore did he transform himself into an angel of light
498520 o adam i am an angel of the great god and behold the hosts that surround me
498521 god has sent me and them to take thee and bring thee to the border of the garden northwards to the shore of the clear sea and bathe thee and eve in it and raise you to your former gladness that ye return again to the garden
498522 know thou and understand concerning this satan that he seeks to deceive thee and thy seed after thee
498523 behold god has commanded me to come into the garden and to take thence sweet smelling incense and give it to adam
498524 dip them in the spring of water then take them and sprinkle their water over adam and eve that they be a little comforted in their sorrow and give them to adam and eve
498525 thou didst ask of me something from the garden to be comforted therewith and i have given thee these three tokens as a consolation to thee that thou trust in me and in my covenant with thee
498526 for i will come and save thee and kings shall bring me when in the flesh gold incense and myrrh gold as a token of my kingdom incense as a token of my divinity and myrrh as a token of my suffering and of my death
498527 but o adam put these by thee in the cave the gold that it may shed light over thee by night the incense that thou smell its sweet savour and the myrrh to comfort thee in thy sorrow
498528 i dont feel i look that different to when i started on the show
498529 i dont think im any different but maybe im kidding myself the thing is that there is nothing definite to say how old each of the characters is people just know how old the actresses are and i think these opinions are drawn from that unfairly in my opinion
498530 gli azzurri della scherma come serpenti non vero io non sono daccordo ha replicato il livornese la gelosia c in tutti i campi ma vi assicuro che quando ho vinto loro io ad atene i miei compagni hanno gioito certo il nostro un mondo piccolo ma di serpentaggine non ne vedo e guardate che storia vezzali trillini avversarie di fioretto e compagne di stanza sul podio col sorriso

498532 i paragoni col ciclismo sono eccessivi ha detto la jesina siamo distanti anni luce io sono vicina a baldini non giudico dico solo che nel nostro sport conta di pi la testa che il fisico e allora il doping a cosa serve
498533 ma io non me la prendo per le vacanze saltate anzi sono felice spiega cassar e non voglio amareggiarmi troppo per questa storia del complotto ma dura da mandare gi capisco che baldini sia in stato confusionale per lui che un atleta questa una situazione difficilissima sotto stress dire certe cose per non giusto forse consigliato male e pensare che a baldini ho fatto da sparring partner fino allaltro giorno

498537 il caso baldini ci ha un p scosso conoscendo il ragazzo siamo certi che non ha fatto uso di alcuna sostanza proibita sono anni che lavoriamo insieme siamo pi che sicuri della sua buona fede
498538 speriamo luned nelle controanalisi ha aggiunto anche se sappiamo che quasi impossibile perch normalmente confermano ci che stata la prima prova c il dubbio che ci attanaglia che qualcuno non si sa chi di che nazione abbia tirato un brutto scherzo al nostro ragazzo
498539 e come combattere contro uno che fa partire il colpo e non lo vedi
498540 immagine rovinata mi sembra davvero troppo una macchia non pu diventare un disastro in cento anni di storia la scherma italiana ha dato tanto al nostro sport e un solo caso di doping meritiamo rispetto

498721 he became a politburo member of the undivided communist party in 1954 the period between 1953 and 1964 when he headed the cpis state unit was among the most productive for the communist movement in punjab

498738 i feel that this decision is biased racist political and disrespectful to this board and all stakeholders of this predominant black school district
498739 if anything it would be racist if we didnt act based on the color of the students in the district our decision was based on their financial situation and the governance of the board not on the race of the students
498740 thats not our intent but the community should realize that their finances are in such terrible shape despite our efforts to help
498741 its future is murky because theyre 12 million in debt
498742 it is important to determine whether these changes meet the preclearance standard because north forest independent school district is an historically black school district
498743 as such education is a vital resource for our students and i will continue to work with officials to fortify the school district
498744 weve had two people assigned to the district to help them improve their academic performance their teachers certainly worked hard this school year
498745 but we took this action largely because of the financial status of the district and the governance issues in the district

498749 when the going gets tough for mccain the tough run sleazier commercials
498750 what the mccain campaign doesn t want people to know according to one gop strategist i spoke with over the weekend is that they had an ad script ready to go if obama had visited the wounded troops saying that obama was wait for it using wounded troops as campaign props so no matter which way obama turned mccain had an obama bashing ad ready to launch i guess that s political hardball but another word for it is the one word that most politicians are loathe to use about their opponents a lie
498751 hmmm i wonder why this fact check article leaves out so many important facts
498752 mccains scurrilous charge that obama failed to visit the troops because he couldnt take the media with him is false

498770 lets not be naive senator obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
498771 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
498772 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
498773 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
498774 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of colour because theyre disproportionately uninsured
498775 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of colour because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

498778 frank was part of a group of black vanguard intellectuals
498779 the people that he came into contact with throughout his life like richard wright and margaret walker were very significant
498780 you could get a lot of strength from a person like frank who had suffered all the discrimination that a black man goes through in america
498781 mccarthy era strategy of smear tactics and condemnation by association
498782 writings of frank marshall davis a voice of the black press
498783 he made his vision into a beacon a light shedding understanding and enlightenment on the problems that denied people regardless of race national origin or economic status their constitutional rights

498789 we grew up on the waterfront in dartmouth and as kids we chased rats and stuff like that but i knew one of these days wed be able to swim here again
498790 the water was a little chilly but it was nice it seemed clean and it was very pleasurable
498791 our tests show very good results and if not we wouldnt be here
498792 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall

498796 platz acht war meine schlechteste startposition der saison in einem samstagsrennen und das noch dazu in ungarn wo man kaum berholen kann ich hatte aber eine sensationelle traktion von der linie weg und erwischte den windschatten von einigen gegnern ich blieb au en und schob mich an mike conway giorgio pantano und karun chandhok vorbei in einem rutsch
498797 danach hatte ich mit meinem ersten reifensatz ein bisschen schwierigkeiten aber das team holte mich zum richtigen zeitpunkt an die box und mit dem zweiten satz war die balance viel besser im zweiten stint konzentrierte ich mich nur noch darauf das auto und die reifen zu schonen heute war einer dieser tage an denen man das maximum aus einem rennen herausholen muss das ist mir glaube ich gelungen
498798 viele sind heute unter druck zerbrochen aber bruno hat einen k hlen kopf bewahrt und hat alles aus dem auto und den umst nden herausgeholt und er hat bewiesen was wir schon seit saisonbeginn wissen dass er definitiv das zeug f r die formel 1 hat

498821 est claro que estados unidos va a presentar una gran selecci n se han dado cuenta de la importancia que tiene el baloncesto internacional y van a llevar a sus grandes jugadores pero nuestra selecci n est preparada para todo y si les ganamos seguro que lograremos una medalla
498822 hac a tiempo que no ven a con la selecci n y estoy muy contento de poder volver a ella es muy bonito poder disfrutar de una experiencia as poder volver a jugar con amigos los torneos ol mpicos siempre son dif ciles espa a s lo ha subido una vez al podio pero somos optimistas y vamos a ver hasta d nde podemos llegar
498823 ahora hay caras nuevas pero el talento es el mismo el feeling que tenemos sigue siendo el mismo a to es un t cnico consagrado tiene su filosof a y no nos ha costado demasiado adaptarnos a ella
498824 ahora somos tres bases diferentes unos de otros nos compaginamos bien yo creo que tenemos el equipo con m s talento de los ltimos a os con los jugadores que hay aqu casi cualquier sistema valdr a y los de a to son muy asequibles
498825 nosotros vamos con toda la ilusi n del mundo y con muchas ganas de hacerlo bien a todos los deportistas les gusta participar en unos juegos ol mpicos y nosotros queremos conseguir una medalla ol mpica y sumar la segunda para espa a tras los ngeles 1984
498826 el ambiente en este grupo siempre es bueno y eso es una de las cosas que m s atractivo hace venir cada verano a la selecci n que la gente que acude lo hace porque quiere nuestros resultados nos colocan entre los favoritos pero hay que dejar claro que a priori debemos tener respeto a todos los rivales desde el principio
498827 ir a los juegos es un sue o que hay que asimilar
498828 a n no tengo asimilado que ir a los juegos ol mpicos yo solo he estado entrenando y pensando en el trabajo diario a to es un gran entrenador que adem s tiene una virtud que no destaca a nadie por encima del resto trata a todos los jugadores por igual
498829 el formato del torneo es distinto al de otros a os y estamos en un grupo complicado as que iremos paso a paso aunque suene a topicazo es lo que hemos de hacer cualquier jugador que llega a la selecci n se adapta muy r pido a este equipo
498830 a m me gusta la forma en la que a to quiere que sus equipos se desenvuelvan en la cancha utiliza un sistema que hace pensar al jugador una filosof a que necesita que el jugador decida en la cancha que lea las jugadas y eso est bien
498831 lo m s positivo es que a los estados unidos no nos los encontraremos en el cruce como pas hace cuatro a os ni a china el anfitri n
498832 guardo muy buenos recuerdos de atenas y s dney los juegos son algo diferente a todos los dem s campeonatos y guardo un buen recuerdo pese a los malos resultados que logramos as que imag nate las ganas que tengo de lograr en esta ocasi n un buen resultado subi ndonos al caj n
498833 el vuelco que ha dado la feb ha sido espectacular
498834 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
498835 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
498836 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
498837 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
498838 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
498839 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
498840 telah datang malaikat jibril dan ia berkata celaka seseorang yang masuk bulan ramadhan tetapi keluar dari bulan ramadhan tidak diampuni dosanya oleh allah dan katakanlah amin maka aku berkata amin kemudian jibril berkata lagi celaka seseorang yang mendapatkan kedua orang tuanya atau salah seorang dari keduanya masih hidup tetapi itu tidak memasukkan dia ke syurga dan katakanlah amin maka kukatakan amin kemudian jibril berkata lagi celaka seseorang yang jika disebut namamu namun dia tidak bershalawat kepadamu dan katakanlah amin maka kukatakan amin
498841 i think she probably went down head first and landed on her back
498842 i wasnt expecting anybody alive at the bottom of the shaft so i was shocked
498843 there are roughly 225 000 more people living with hiv in the u s than previously suspected
498844 if you are a young gay black man the likelihood that you will encounter hiv is staggeringly high even if your personal behavior is no more risky than people in other communities
498845 the united states can be proud of having more than tripled its remarkable commitment to the global hiv aids epidemic
498846 these new figures from cdc demonstrate that the domestic epidemic needs a similar response
498847 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by the cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the u s hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease

498888 tried hard to impress the world and to prove the country deserves respect and appreciation
498889 but the west used the olympic torch relay and the coming games to shame the country and frequently remind the chinese they were not good enough
498890 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
498891 were teaching them that the olympic spirit is international that it doesnt just belong to one country
498892 they said this was the first time that china was communicating to the outside world rather than waiting for the world to come to us
498893 we hoped that the olympics would help people understand our countrys achievements that this ancient civilization has started a new chapter
498894 but from the torch relay we suddenly realized that we were preparing to open the nations front door to welcome people who do not wish us well
498895 here we build sports venues fix rail lines and construct airports hurrying like a raging fire to prepare there people use darfur one day and tibet the next to fan the flames of protest and boycott whats going on
498896 this is a hot face pressed on a cold rump
498897 there were signs of apprehension about the country and its growing power
498898 it was because of cnn and bbcs attitude so we did not broadcast at that time
498899 it was because the earthquake happened the march 14 beating smashing and looting incident happened the timing was up to us
498900 these olympics will perhaps hurt the feelings of other countries but it will be good for chinese
498901 we care less about human rights than other countries and more about sovereignty thats bound to create an awkward feeling among other countries

498937 though my daughter needs much more attention and care i wont be able to quit my job now
498938 we are earning good money but all our plans have been unsettled and we are mentally stressed

498940 there have been cases where such teachers have received salary cheques with thumb impressions
498941 the current draft requires the teacher pupil ratio of 1 40 to be maintained in every school by that count we need to hire some 8 10 lakh teachers
498942 amit kaushik who as director at the union human resource development ministry was in the team that rolled out the ssa in 2002 says
498943 they would be more closely aligned to the community aspirations i have seen such a system work in karnataka for one
498944 this bill is just a statement of intent for the system to get better many more bills need to be enacted
498945 at the same time there is the second leg of the 10 year ssa to worry about
498946 from 2012 when the ssa mission ends one can look at setting up a fund on the lines of the global fund for aids tuberculosis and malaria put together with the education cess thats already being collected
498947 i love that song and it was selfish of me to do that and to make my characters sing but i think i got away with that i knew there wouldnt be much of a connect but wanted to introduce the youngsters to a beautiful song
498948 last years blockbuster om shanti om was a parody paying tribute to the 70s cinema
498949 ive grown up on those films and didnt even have to refer to them while making this film
498950 i just thought it would be fun to see a young amitabh on screen
498951 inspirations and tributes aside remakes are back in vogue leaving devdas aside farhan akhtars don kicked off the trend
498952 i watched it as a kid and could never shake it out of my consciousness as i grew up my fascination for the don 1978 character increased and i wanted to give it a second lease of life that selfish need led to the remake
498953 he was surprised but understood my fascination for don which was more of a cult film and is not counted among amit uncles most popular so i wanted to explore the potential of the story
498954 within an old idea if you can find something that provokes you that inspires you then why not
498955 the 70s have set the standard for us so they will remain the referral points i would love to remake waqt
498956 the stories of those larger than life films are a personification of contemporary morality and aspirations the viewers could relate to the protagonists those films had a context and a meaning todays remakes are just about entertainment they are capers
498957 its easier for the directors to sell it to the producers as they can see what you want to do
498958 i simply locked myself at the low interest rate for the long term but never thought that my decision would turn out so fruitful
498959 i find myself lucky to have taken the right decision
498960 if that happens i would be left with no option but to sell
498961 when i bought the house i never expected the interest rates would go up like this
498962 i had to raise the salary of my six employees which has come as an additional burden on me
498963 after the godhra riots we wanted to move home but no one would buy our property even for rs 2 lakh
498964 though it is said to be safe now of course because of the blasts people from this side are not going there
498965 it is not the residents but political forces who instigate people to create chaos we live in harmony here yes there is a border but we can cross it freely
498966 many of my customers are hindu but when there is a problem everything turns ugly
498967 i visit the other side of the border every day people are warm and peaceful on both sides it is only during such times that things get uncontrollable
498968 during the godhra riots we couldnt leave our homes for three months when we stepped out stones and fireballs greeted us
498969 it is also a christian institution that offers a meeting ground here as all divides converge at the don bosco high school 10 minutes from jhuapara
498970 all borders dissolve the moment our students enter the campus
498971 george who has taught at the school for 24 years admits
498972 the school conducts awareness programmes every month to ensure the peace is not disturbed within its walls and hopefully outside them too other peacemakers like aziz gandhi stand squarely at the border defying the loc as they work towards unity
498973 what do i have to do tell me carefully www gmail com just that how can that be what about http and www dont i have to type those what is a password how is it different from the user name
498974 you think that your biological clock is about to go kaput but i thinkyou should have a child
498975 ill talk to you when i come to delhi next week
498976 later when i narrated the conversation to my brother he mulled over the following
498977 they are not even 10 and they say f and s all the time
498978 but even she agreed that though kids these days may start using four letter words before they live out a decade of existence one should have a child clearly she and her significant other had been exchanging notes
498979 see youve worked so hard to buy a house someone has to be around to inherit it
498980 i am in the clear because im planning to sell off my apartment
498981 dont you read the papers on television i know she only watches k serials
498982 home loan interest rates have gone up so much that even though im going for broke i cannot cope with the pressure
498983 just to make my point more pertinent i told her about how some of my colleagues who have families to support and hefty emis that are getting heftier by the day to pay are spending sleepless nights
498984 what is going to happen to you not only dont you have a husband and children to take care of you soon you wont even have a home to call your own i fear for your future
498985 we will just have to remember this in our minds
498986 she says that once we know how to make her desserts she wont have anything to do
498987 half the time i have to think like a forty plus woman i have to keep reminding myself im not me im my mother
498988 whatever bahl does he is doing extremely well as is evident from the success of soaps he has conceived or been associated with like saat phere and banoo mein teri dulhann during his previous stint with zee and hamari devrani and raja ki aayegi baarat on star plus
498989 there is a science that goes into getting the show right it comes from experience from trial and error
498990 i wish i had the same science to understand women
498991 for a long time both star and zee tried afternoon shows that never clicked i wanted to try something different i wanted to see if i could do a fun tacky show that talked to a certain viewer hamari devrani was part of that experiment it could have bombed but it worked
498992 i dont like working with fence sitters the people who enjoy the fruits of making soaps and yet turn up their noses at the genre i like people who dont look down upon the genre you need to believe in the product to make a good product otherwise it reflects in the product
498993 we have to ensure we are thinking on the same lines
498994 the process depends on channel to channel but while conceiving a new show the channel acts as a guide because it has done research about what works with viewers and what does not
498995 we have to understand the sensibility of that audience and ensure we cater to it in terms of the shows look costumes characterisation etc
498996 in terms of look house and characterisation our serials are a little aspirational
498997 people in mumbai dont only look down on soaps they also look down on acting in tv bollywood is the bigger draw so often we are ready to shoot but we dont have the right cast
498998 because you dont know whom to cast even average or below average actors are becoming stars
498999 writers are so scarce that once youve built a rapport with a production house you invariably get called on to write new shows i get at least one such call every day
499000 writers are notoriously unprofessional they often take commitments and dont deliver the industry is desperate for good and reliable writers so if you fit the bill everyone wants you
499001 the channel might give us feedback that this track is running too fast lets develop it properly
499002 it can take 100 episodes sometimes five to be in sync with what the channel wants
499003 i know that you have to make the female protagonist cry there is a psychological reason to it people respond most to someone who is crying because they feel it is a display of honesty viewers trust a person who cries there is empathy so the heroine needs to cry as often as possible
499004 i told her the day you smile the channel will cry
499005 so how much in advance do you work i ask smita jain
499006 television is all about firefighting it can be crazy ive been given a screenplay at 6 am and asked to write dialogues for a shoot at 9 am
499007 doing a daily is stressful because you have to shoot every day you can have actor problems or outdoor problems during the monsoon but you can avoid most of the stress if you plan well
499008 but sometimes the best plans can go awry because of situations out of your control
499009 one of the lead actors in santaan recently caught chicken pox we had the whole story written ahead but we had to write in an extra 12 episodes at the last minute while ensuring the rest of the story did not change shooting was cut to cut but it had to be done
499010 when you have a new show you have a lot of drama to exploit but when you have exploited all relationships you go to step 2 that includes murders and kidnappings
499011 the presumptive republican nominee has embarked on a bare knuckled barrage of negative advertising aimed at belittling mr obama
499012 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
499013 this is what life is all about just a swanging and whistling

499038 people fail to realise that the success of the surge was the result of a tacit agreement between the us and iran
499039 there really is an iranian american condominium ruling iraq these days
499040 violence is down to its lowest level since the spring of 2004 and were now in our third consecutive month with reduced violence levels holding steady
499041 a significant reason for this sustained progress is the success of the surge
499042 this operation is iraqi led our forces are playing a supporting role

499114 on 23 march 1994 the medical examiner viewed the body of ronald opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound of the head

499116 the room on the ninth floor whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife
499117 when one intends to kill subject a but kills subject b in the attempt one is guilty of the murder of subject b
499118 the continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couples son loading the shotgun approximately six weeks prior to the fatal incident it transpired that the old lady cut off her sons financial support and the son knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother the case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of ronald opus

499154 what happened to argentinas involuntary immigrants those african slaves and their mulatto descendants who once outnumbered whites five to one and who were for 250 years an important element in the total population which is now 97 percent white
499155 the disappearance of the negro from the argentine scene has puzzled demographers far more than the vanishing indian
499156 argentines like to think of themselves as a white nation populated by europeans i was surprised when in the us people especially latinos told me i was not white but spanish
499157 minorities in argentina indigenous afro etcetera suffer from a problem of invisibility and poor organization
499158 people of mixed ancestry are often not considered black in argentina historically because having black ancestry was not considered proper today the term negro is used loosely on anyone with slightly darker skin but they can be descendants of indigenous indians middle eastern immigrants people in africa vive say there are a million afrodescendientes in argentina although many people are not aware that they may have had a black great grandmother or father i think that this is an overestimation i would estimate that there are 2 or 3 thousand afro argentines descendants of slaves negros criollos 8 to 10 thousand in the cape verdean community most born in argentina and id add another 1 200 brazilian uruguayan cuban and african communities
499159 different groups have emerged including grupo cultural afro and sos racismo but africa vive is probably the most important group that has rekindled interest in things african in argentina
499160 it is the main group composed of afro argentines descendants of the original afro argentine population africa vive has successfully drawn the medias attention they organized a conference against discrimination at the university of buenos aires in 1999 and were written up in an eight page article in the daily clarin the article was significant because for the first time in almost thirty years the term afro argentine community was used instead of black community
499161 last september these black groups led by africa vive convinced a national deputy to organize a ceremony in memory of black soldiers who died fighting for argentinas independence the event took place in one of the traditional halls of the national congress and was attended by the commander in chief of the army and the head of state the national deputy spoke in honor of the fallen black soldiers and then awarded honorary degrees to the heads of several black organizations it was quite remarkable that such an event could take place in argentina
499162 where they got killed off fighting indians another race argentines were interested in exterminating
499163 there was an official concerted effort to eliminate the blacks from argentine society
499164 perhaps an atavistic preference for black women body odor led them to matrimony and the blacks accepted them as whites
499165 almost whites because the italian has much african in him and his color is a dull pale
499166 there is a silence about the participation of afro argentines in the history and building of argentina a silence about the enslavement and poverty
499167 the denial and disdain for the afro community shows the racism of an elite that sees africans as undeveloped and uncivilized the poverty in the afro community was terrible although slavery was abolished in 1813 the death rate of freed blacks was always higher than that of white people and of slaves why is that because in buenos aires slaves were very expensive so the masters took real good care of them once a black got his freedom his living standards collapsed even further
499168 afro uruguayan and afro brazilian migrants to buenos aires have been instrumental in expanding black culture teaching afro uruguayan candombe afro brazilian capoeira orisha and secular dances to white argentines
499169 the military dictatorships from 1966 onwards prohibited or severely constrained the gathering of people in the street or in closed spaces a practice which certainly negatively influenced carnivals which almost disappeared tango dancing which died out until it was revitalized in the 1990s and also black dance clubs such as the shimmy club all genres of popular culture severely suffered during the dictatorships and many almost disappeared but began resurfacing in the 1990s

499222 m s posesi n y jug m s r pido
499223 nosotros marcamos e incluso con los problemas hacia el final controlamos la primera parte
499224 ya pensamos en la copa uefa y en el real madrid
499225 ganarle al madrid siempre es dif cil para nosotros o cualquier equipo espa ol a partir de ah es verdad que desde el a o 91 no han ganado en la coru a y eso es buena noticia para todo el deportivismo y eso es una ventaja quieras o no cuando antes se juegue es mejor
499226 ese equipo viene de un pa s como croacia que estuvo en la eurocopa y eso no nos debemos olvidar hemos tenido mala suerte en el sorteo ahora vamos a ver lo que significa como est n y es evidente que nosotros representamos al f tbol espa ol y no debemos asustarnos de jugar sea ante alemanes en este caso croatas o ingleses
499227 para pasar la eliminatoria tememos el segundo partido fuera de casa es un peque o problema sobre todo por una afici n como la croata que aprieta mucho pero estamos ilusionados con este torneo
499228 queremos hacer un buen partido ante el mar timo queremos una mejora individual y colectiva pensando en s en la uefa y pensar en el futuro con los jugadores de peso

499233 its so stupid and im not supposed to like contests and care about it i just sucked last year and the year before so i got obsessive about doing good on it
499234 i feel that this decision is biased racist political and disrespectful to this board and all stakeholders of this predominant black school district
499235 if anything it would be racist if we didnt act based on the color of the students in the district our decision was based on their financial situation and the governance of the board not on the race of the students
499236 thats not our intent but the community should realize that their finances are in such terrible shape despite our efforts to help
499237 its future is murky because theyre 12 million in debt
499238 it is important to determine whether these changes meet the preclearance standard because north forest independent school district is an historically black school district
499239 as such education is a vital resource for our students and i will continue to work with officials to fortify the school district
499240 weve had two people assigned to the district to help them improve their academic performance their teachers certainly worked hard this school year
499241 but we took this action largely because of the financial status of the district and the governance issues in the district
499242 we visualized in great detail the nose the eyes according to the chemical composition

499248 mccain is still i think upset about the op ed not being printed
499249 a lot of the maverick positioning is now turning into more conservative positioning and some of that includes not being afraid to go negative not being afraid to call a liberal a liberal and not being afraid to go after a newspaper
499250 latte drinking sushi eating volvo driving new york times reading
499251 has really become a symbol for a lot of conservative grievances

499334 a ceo has to have some kind of identity being nice is not good enough a large company needs to have a ceo who is recognised by the media the general and business community he has to be known for being an honest and responsible person with leadership qualities
499335 real estate developer donald trump is brash a deal maker and purveyor of luxury and class and media tycoon rupert murdoch is serious firm and a global force sir richard branson is open intelligent witty and honest
499336 each of them has an identity and leadership qualities this instils confidence
499337 the investing public and the general community wants a leader who is able to take charge particularly when there is a crisis
499338 the last and worst thing a ceo can do is to avoid the media that does not score any marks for confidence
499339 the ceo must come across as responsible many times people do not want to admit there is a problem in such cases no communications strategist will be able to help it is a management problem
499340 this is not self promotion talk about the company and what it is doing in todays changing business world where is your industry heading investors and shareholders will want to know
499341 branding a ceo is different from doing a commercial package the information that is to be shared neatly and with interesting anecdotes be human and real
499342 do not go before a camera unprepared and do not put someone who has not been trained in front of the camera that is a terrible thing to do all public professionals worth their salt will prepare the ceo for the possible questions to be asked and how they ought to be answered
499343 an interview is not an interrogation it is a dialogue between two friends so it is okay to admit you do not know about the sales done in the philippines but the performance in china is tremendous do not be evasive or mumble some unintelligible response that will come back to haunt you
499344 remember that the press is not an army out there to get you they just want to get a good story they are competing with their own colleagues for space in their publication they do not have an agenda
499345 the press deserves an answer they have a readership who wants to know and you as the ceo have shareholders and investors who want to know what is going on
499346 the role of branding in nation building cannot be underestimated brands are the engine of economic growth the growth of malaysian brands will herald the arrival of malaysia as a key contender in the global marketpace

499349 the judge at the end of the day is our customers so we have to increase their accessibility to our products and services
499350 spending time with consumers in the real world where and when they actually engage with media
499351 dont think in terms of media when they are actually experiencing it
499352 the rules have changed we must match our message with the mode mindset no one wants to be disrupted with informative messages when theyre in entertainment mode its jarring and off putting
499353 the higher revenue is due to higher advertising revenue arising from the 50th merdeka celebrations strong contribution from tv9 and recently acquired outdoor companies together with significantly higher revenue recorded by radio networks
499354 our aggressive expansion strategy into new media platforms coupled with the successful execution of strategies to attract new non traditional advertisers have started to really bear fruit as reflected by the strong growth in revenue and earnings
499355 we are also excited by the development of our new online media which we hope will be another major value driver in the long term
499356 one of the key reasons they are doing this is the ability to test different messages based on consumer insight and feedback from the internet
499357 as a marketer we need to make sure we are giving consistent messaging wherever consumers are looking for information
499358 thats the beauty of the internet and online advertising you can continually test what messages work best and what does not you cant really do this with traditional media
499359 online advertising allows customers to pull relevant marketing messages at the moment they demonstrate strong interest when they are searching for information or browsing their favourite websites
499360 this is the exact opposite of traditional advertising which pushes out marketing messages sometimes in intrusive ways based on customer demographics and reach
499361 online advertising is becoming a bigger portion of the media mix but other media outlets still have a bite consumers are looking for information in multiple sources so whats going to be more important is for marketers to get their messages across through multiple touch points
499362 some companies especially financial and automotive firms understand the importance of an integrated marketing approach companies that have grasped this know that a sales cycle exists
499363 we already started testing mobile ads in singapore we recognise that the number of mobile users is increasing and some people skip the personal computer phase the trend is clear that more and more people are searching for information on the go so our platform is a natural extension thats going to be offered on google for mobile
499364 previously many asian managers saw branding as something very tactical and something with a cost
499365 now many ceos in asia are showing interest in branding compared to five years ago
499366 in the us a third of a companys budget is allocated for pushing the brand while most asian companies are still volume oriented
499367 said branding must be dealt with at the boardroom level with the ceo leading the brand strategy efforts
499368 you can measure the return on investment the brand equity and price premium
499369 ten years ago branding was much harder to measure but a lot of different tools and methodologies have been developed and it is now much easier to measure the value of branding
499370 but this is going to change in the next 10 to 20 years when more global brands will come from asia
499371 the principle of building a global brand is as applicable in asia as they are in the developed world
499372 one of the studies has shown that 80 per cent of the value of the brand comes from cash flow from the future while only 20 per cent of the value of your brand comes from the first three years of your cash flow

499380 advertisers have specific demographics that they are targeting and google has an expressed interest in this area we have a whole different model with two way conversations between the advertiser and the consumer marketing messages can become more targeted
499381 the business models are still being defined a lot of them are ad supported right now we have orkut googles social network and we are partners with myspace this is a unique opportunity for brand marketers as social networking is estimated to be worth us 2 billion by 2010 it is still in its early days but the sheer volume of users that marketers can leverage on is amazing because millions of users spend hours on these sites i believe this trend is here to stay
499382 we have not introduced mobile advertising services in malaysia yet but we are currently testing it in singapore and we are seeing great results googles mobile advertising is not location based it is internet based accessed through gprs or high speed mobile data service

499496 although they know gods righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death they not only continue to do these things but also approve of those who practice them
499497 i shall certainly bring home its own badness upon the productive land and their own error upon the wicked themselves
499498 the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire being kept for the day of judgement and destruction of ungodly men
499499 the one chasing after what is bad is in line for his own death
499500 my word will not return to me empty but will accomplish what i desire and achieve the purpose for which i sent it
499501 an onward sweeping tempest that will not turn back until he will have carried out the ideas of his heart
499502 you must certainly put him to death your hand must be the first in putting him to death
499503 let god hurry and do his work so we can see it
499504 arise o lord deliver me o my god strike all my enemies on the jaw break the teeth of the wicked from the lord comes deliverance may your blessings be on your people
499505 come on we have to go get jimmy to take credit for this

499507 dr francis cheney 1848 is also eulogized as one of the notable men of early dryden and that probably explains the cheney connection at the white house
499508 que pasa sounds like a conspiracy to prove that japan is producing explosive gas tanks
499509 a wild donkey of a man whose hand was against everyone and everyones hand was against him
499510 these are the sh theads you want listen to them they talk like idiots
499511 let god hurry and do his work so we can see it
499512 let me take you down cause im going to strawberry fields
499513 nothings going to happen no body is going to do nothing about it
499514 this is a lone demonstrator the leaflet does not request contributions or break capitol police regulations the applicant has an application on file with special events any questions should be directed to special events us capitol police
499515 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
499516 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
499517 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
499518 thats how we can protect our coastline and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good
499519 its not going to provide short term relief or medium term relief or in fact long term relief it wont drop prices in this administration or in the next administration or in the administration after that
499520 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
499521 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
499522 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling
499523 we hope barack obama will realize that his ongoing opposition to john mccains realistic energy solutions and additional offshore drilling is wrong
499524 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
499525 lifting the ban would create new opportunities for american workers and businessmen
499526 but the leaders of the democratic congress have refused to allow a vote
499527 the president knows that the impact of any new drilling will be insignificant promising savings of only pennies per gallon many years down the road
499528 there very pretty slut now get up and sit down and leave those panties where they lay

499533 theres fear excitement question marks shock but its incredibly exciting and now we just have to wait and see
499534 once upon a time there were three waves on the ocean reflecting on their kind of actions the middle wave thought out aloud i am the centre of all action i push the wave in front of myself and i pull another wave behind me the first wave responded this is not the case it is me who pulls you behind me now the third wave cried you both are wrong because i can feel it clearly i push you two in front of me
499535 there are no negotiations at this point she and keith have decided that they dont want to release a picture that may change later but at this point thats the situation ms day said
499536 is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason
499537 that at the beginning the creator made them male and female and said for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh
499538 did moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away
499539 moses permitted you to divorce your wives but it was not this way from the beginning i tell you that anyone who divorces his wife except for marital unfaithfulness different life goals constant arguing over which new bmw to buy or a clash over the colour scheme in the kitchen and marries another woman isnt very sensible

499544 and three seth fits a little better in the pen its easier to bring seth in in a situation in the middle of an inning or to shutdown an inning i dont envision him as a long guy fifth sixth seventh inning type stuff
499545 i told them both that i wanted try this and if it wasnt good for either one of them then id have to make a decision
499546 all ive done this year is do what i was asked and done it well and ill continue to do that hopefully i pitch more often than i have and i asked ned that and he said he would pitch me more often he said i wouldnt necessarily be the long guy and i hope he stays true to that
499547 this team is playing for something very large and im happy to be a part of that my individual wants are secondary to the teams needs im not happy about it at all but ill deal with it and im going to pitch to the best of my abilities no matter where
499548 the easiest thing is just to be on a schedule
499549 i think that was the hardest thing for both of us not being able to completely prepare for either role trying to be ready for both and not being fully ready for either one i definitely had no problem pitching out of the bullpen as much as being stuck in the middle
499550 i couldnt stick with the same running and lifting schedule and throwing in the bullpen schedule that you typically do when youre starting some of the days i would have done at work i had to be ready to pitch in the bullpen

499557 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
499558 i think theyre cynical and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
499559 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
499560 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama for his continued opposition to john mccains

499567 the recent border dispute regarding the listing of the preah vihear temple as a world heritage site causes strong continuing protests from some organizations and people in thailand which led to a confrontative situation between people of both countries
499568 as professors involved in studies on southeast asia we want to confirm that the source of this border dispute relates to the historical and cultural heritages of thailand and of cambodia
499569 according to this we would like to suggest the following
499570 as for the preah vihear temple we absolutely support the verdict of the international court of justice in the hague in the netherlands of 15 may 1962 which confirmed that the temple of preah vihear is situated in territory under the sovereignty of cambodia
499571 we support and we publish intense discussions about related problems and the provision of information should not be used to cause discrimination or to create enemies between the countries on both sides of the border which might lead to war
499572 we acknowledge that also other countries in the region have the common cultures and common histories
499573 we have advised that action should be taken to solve this dispute through coordination and mutual commitment the association of southeast asian nations should take up this idea in order to reach a common goal
499574 we would like to urge professors parents the press students and the cambodian and thai people to call for a peaceful solution of this dispute by upholding the respect for the territory of all countries in southeast asia as the basis
499575 tougher government reforms than any other candidate in this race reforms that would eliminate the kind of no bid contracts that this administration has given to blackwater
499576 most contractors act as if the law doesnt apply to them under my plan if contractors break the law they will be prosecuted
499577 we have to crack down on private contractors like blackwater because i dont believe they should be able to run amok and put our own troops in danger and get paid three or four times or ten times what our soldiers are getting paid
499578 we are absolutely confident that the carlsberg gold is going to be a hit in the street and now all malaysians can enjoy carlsberg gold everyday during every occasion

499588 but we must learn to let go to relax completely before each period of in tense concentration here is the working principle relaxation precedes perfect concentration a delightful illustration of this point is given by elizabeth towne six puppies were playing in the barn the barn door was closed and with the world shut out they were giving themselves up completely to the spirit of play two of them were staging a mock battle over a feather while the others were rolling over and over in the loose straw on the barn floor in utter enjoyment suddenly the barn door softly creaked instantly every puppy came to attention heads up tails up bodies rigid bright eyes fixed in intense concentration on that door as it slowly swung open a moment before they had been in a state of complete relaxation now they offered a perfect example of concentration as they stood at attention waiting and watching for the unknown danger that might be coming from the other side of the barn door all great mental achievement has been preceded by periods of absolute rest or relaxtion during this time fatigue disappears the nervous forces recuperate and the minds stores up fresh energy axed establishes a reserve to draw upon during
499589 of relaxation will which he pointed out that continual tress and strain high tension without periods relaxation were responsible for much chronic fatigue and many a nervous breakdown

499601 would literally take away with one hand what has been given with the other
499602 the nsg guidelines apply to non nuclear weapons states nnws so our preference is for the nsg to simply say that these guidelines do not apply to india if they are unwilling to say that at a minimum the requirement of full scope safeguards and other prescriptive elements in the guidelines that are intended for nnws must be waived for india
499603 if you read the nsg guidelines as a whole right at the top it says these prescriptions are for non nuclear weapons states there is an enunciation of the requirement that countries must accept full scope safeguards there is language about what happens if one of these states tests there is restrictive language on enrichment and reprocessing enr equipment and so on
499604 of course we are very clear that there cannot be any linkage with nuclear tests
499605 but just as in the 123 agreement with the u s there cannot be any explicit linkage to nuclear testing as a condition in the nsg
499606 i am not interested in labels like the npt definition of a nuclear weapon state because we are what we are
499607 but certainly we dont want the other label to be attached to us either
499608 are any of these elements present in those agreements so our view is that all these things in the nsg are extraneous tomorrow if the political situation changes all these things can create difficulties

499647 i probably could have made a series of the same movie but thats not my style
499648 my next is a horror movie my hope is that itll be really good but its not a slam dunk and i have a tendency to go for movies like that like field of dreams
499649 in retrospect a lot of people enjoyed field of dreams but that movie stood a good chance of not working a big chance the question is can you ride the edge with the horror movie i think we have a chance of making a classic in that genre maybe we havent maybe we have but thats more intriguing to me than just making something where we know how it works
499650 i wouldnt think that would be that different than anybody else theyre so hard to make anyway why would you make a movie if you didnt think it had a chance to live beyond its opening weekend im not immune to wanting my movies to make money because i do my first instinct is do i think people could like this

499660 im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama i am african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate
499661 let me be clear in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
499662 i think they were cynical and i think they want to distract from talking about the real issues
499663 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
499664 the one thing we know about the team that john mccains assembled is that theyre very good at negative campaigns theyre not so good at governing
499665 its not really clear exactly what its based on if i was presumptuous or taking this for granted i wouldnt be working this hard this week im beat
499666 obviously we think this is going to be a close race all the way through
499667 i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest we think its got a lot of humor in it and were having fun and enjoying it
499668 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama for his continued opposition to john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling gas tax relief and affordable nuclear energy
499669 at some point people are going to have to make decisions are we going to keep arguing or are we going to get things done
499670 what i dont want to do is for the best to be the enemy of the good
499671 and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things that i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of actual energy independence then thats something im open to
499672 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
499673 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
499674 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
499675 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
499676 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
499677 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
499678 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
499679 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
499680 if weve got a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like then obviously thats something that i would consider because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
499681 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
499682 thats how we can protect our coastline and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good
499683 its not going to provide short term relief or medium term relief or in fact long term relief it wont drop prices in this administration or in the next administration or in the administration after that
499684 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
499685 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
499686 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling
499687 the president has failed in his economic policy and now he wants to say but for drilling in protected areas offshore our economy would be thriving and the price of gas would be lower
499688 that hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to relieve the pain of consumers at the pump and to promote energy independence
499689 we are so thrilled to have our next guest back at yankee stadium
499690 once a yankee always a yankee welcome back willie randolph
499691 its all boiling down to he really doesnt want to hurt those former teammates
499692 its just of a matter of what he wants more is playing more important or keeping those guys out of the friction that would come if he reports
499693 mark murphy had talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
499694 and frankly its good for brett because brett needs to stay part of football and obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
499695 i dont think it makes any sense for us to speculate
499696 we talked a lot about this and well just leave it at that
499697 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while

499700 we are gratified that the commission did not find any conduct by comcast that justified a fine and that the deadline established in the order is the same self imposed deadline that we announced four months ago on the other hand we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
499701 without making a judgment on the substance of todays ruling it is clear that the federal communication commission is prepared to uphold its broadband principles now the entire industry should redouble its efforts to set standards for transparency and ensure that consumers know what they are getting when purchasing access or using applications
499702 cdt agrees with the rulings apparent premise that broadband providers should not target specific applications for inferior treatment and should be much more transparent about network management practices cdt has serious concerns however about the potential breadth of the commissions assertion of authority and the risk that it could open the door to greater fcc regulatory involvement in internet issues
499703 chairman kevin martin and commissioners michael copps and jonathan adelstein deserve enormous credit for recognizing that a legitimate digital music marketplace cannot emerge unless there are consistent and transparent rules that allow a level playing field for innovators consumers and creators the ability to use legal applications is crucial to an internet that fosters innovation commerce and creativity
499704 comcasts throttling of legal internet traffic had nothing to do with network management as the company claims it had everything to do with a big company trying to exert its power over a captive internet market
499705 the fccs bipartisan decision to punish comcast is a major victory defying every ounce of conventional wisdom in washington everyday people have taken on a major corporation and won an historic precedent for an open internet

499709 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
499710 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
499711 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
499712 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
499713 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
499714 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
499715 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
499716 people say he cant run and get elected if he says those kinds of things
499717 im like well does that mean were really not ready for a black president
499718 yes lets do it but you have never made a game we have to have experienced people do it
499719 digital media can be very compelling and powerful evidence it can even be overwhelming in the right circumstances
499720 thats the world we live in thats a fact of life everybody has a camera
499721 i tell all the protest groups that go out public places to have someone in their group with video camera
499722 just like a live witness any piece or source of evidence needs to be examined analyzed and challenged
499723 it is imperative to recognize that a photograph or video shows only one angle at a specific snapshot in time
499724 the yb ks record hits way harder than the last one its way more aggressive and i think it comes closer to being that dance album we tried to make the first time
499725 nothing but good responses so much so that weve only been playing the new material on the road
499726 we believe that we should be launching more products than what will ultimately become phenomenally popular the way you find really successful new innovation is to release five things and hope that one or two of them really take off

499766 as things stand perhaps to look at an inflation rate of 8 9 per cent will be a difficult thing but probably we will do it by march 2009
499767 you can get a much lower rate of inflation if there is confluence of favourable factors such as moderation in oil prices and so on otherwise if the oil prices remain at the prevailing rate that is best estimate for inflation
499768 as far as growth is concerned it will slow down it will slow down than what we have experienced in previous years but nevertheless i think we can still hope to have gdp growth of economy between 7 5 to 8 per cent

499774 ideally if we had got a lead it would have been brilliant but i thought harbhajan bowled very well the previous day to pick up thilan samaraveera and tillakaratne dilshan that put us on the back foot
499775 a cursory look at the recent serial blasts that rocked parts of bangalore has brought to fore the deficiencies in the internal security system and the need for improvement in the working of police department

499778 while all this sounds hunky dory there are big questions that operators will have to face once they launch services since india has one of the lowest average revenues per user arpu globally the demand for such services may be quite limited
499779 while it might seem reasonable that the average stock market return over the last 50 years is a logical estimate for what the next 50 years may hold there is a large range of error in the historical average
499780 it is critically important to remember that investment decisions should be based on what is possible not just on what has transpired in the past
499781 why the more models you test the more likely you are to find a spurious fit to the historical data

499787 the left parties had never shied away from raising peoples issues even when they were supporting the upa government at the centre and it would continue to do so even if it meant opposing the bsp government over issues relating to the farmers labourers and others

499791 when we gave the mice a small amount of daily exercise in the presence or not of the drug all showed an increased ability to run but those on the drug gained an additional hour
499792 its tricking the muscle into believing its been exercised daily
499793 its basically the couch potato experiment and it proves you can have a pharmacologic equivalent to exercise
499794 the drug by itself had no impact on running ability
499795 we were blown away that aicar alone mimicked exercise not to the same level but a healthy boost
499796 in this study we revealed that synthetic ppard activation and exercise or more importantly ampk activation alone provides a robust transcriptional cue that re programs the skeletal muscle genome and dramatically enhances endurance
499797 we believe that the strategy of re organizing the preset genetic imprint of muscle as well as other tissues using exercise mimetic drugs has therapeutic potential in treating certain muscle diseases such as wasting and frailty as well as obesity where exercise is known to be beneficial

499801 you two the rev and el comandante make an erudite pair i guess it beats thinking
499802 adding insult to injury it appears you are wading into this debate on very shaky procedural and legal grounds while the fcc has endorsed certain internet policy principles it has never adopted regulations through a proper notice and comment rulemaking nor should it for the reasons i outline above nonetheless your continued pursuit of this matter suggests that you are making not only a poor policy judgment but a poor legal one as well
499803 prepared to fundamentally reconsider the course of us foreign policy
499804 prohibiting obama from speaking at the gate would be like prohibiting foreign politicians from speaking at the national mall in washington just because martin luther king held his big speech there in 1963
499805 when is he coming who will he meet and more importantly what will he say
499806 the senator from illinois must take care not to seem overly pro european
499807 its therefore unlikely that obama will wax lyrical about europes leadership on combating climate change or health insurance
499808 there is a certain irony to it all it took a major war for george w bush to strain the transatlantic relationship but for his wannabe successor the campaigning senator from illinois all it takes is a speech announcement
499809 what would otherwise be criticized as pretentious attention getting in the case of obama the social democrats it is labeled as
499810 the awacs deployment may be logical but it shows once again how the german bundeswehr is logical step by logical step stumbling into the fighting in afghanistan overall it is a worrying development
499811 attention must be given to this continuing scandal this incomprehensible stupidity this appalling result of imperial arrogance now that the united states has opened a new embassy building in such a spectacular location next to the brandenburg gate exactly there where 69 years ago there was an earlier embassy even if then as now without an ambassador he was recalled to washington after the reichspogromnacht november 9 10 1938 of the nazis against the jews today nothing has de facto changed although william r timken who holds the title of ambassador is physically present in the capital of the germans politically he is absent completely and he has absolutely nothing to say to germans at all
499812 not only because subway security is taken much more seriously from new york to los angeles subway stations have security cameras and sheriffs more importantly drunkenness cannot be used as a mitigating factor to reduce prison sentences on the contrary it is illegal to drink under the age of 21 and in most states criminals who are 18 years old are treated as adults in some states this is the case even for 16 and 17 year olds
499813 it is sick the heart it is empty it is old wrinkled used it beats only weakly it is slowly bleeding it offers little hope oh america how could it come to this there where the new man struggled to build his utopia of a new world with sweat on his brow but always aware while working his own piece of ground that he was a gentlemen servant to no one there where the air smelled like the sweet fragrance of freedom and the horizon reached to an infinite distance there in rural america in the heart of the nation in their mythical heartland the hard times are there to stay it was destroyed when agriculture rediscovered itself as an industry which required fewer workers and certainly no free self centered people
499814 it is a symbol of how america deals with the war it started in the middle east thereby provoking the return of the protest culture he wants for the president to get lost and for the war to end
499815 then it comes to the highpoint in georgia they play impeach the president the audience feeling lucky and besides themselves to be able to see the four ageing hippies crosby stills nash and young one last time in their lives becomes indignant there is a war going on and who turns his back on the country with such heavenly music deserves ripped up concert tickets and booing because pop and politics are two different things in predominantly apolitical in america
499816 d j vu the film is way too late in considering the american presidential campaign one must instinctively think of a more recent campaign that of candidate barack obama the attacks on president bush are now outdated
499817 the senator from illinois must take care not to seem overly pro european
499818 many germans believe the sentences are too harsh says the german weekly news magazine focus
499819 people have got to be exceptionally careful what they do outside

499822 das rennen fand ich superspannend es war richtig was los auf der rennstrecke das ist f r ungarn eigentlich untypisch denn es gibt nur wenige berholm glichkeiten
499823 diese siegerehrung werde ich so schnell nicht vergessen als wir das podium verlassen wollten war pl tzlich die t r verschlossen und wir konnten nicht mehr raus meinen ersten sieg wollte ich nat rlich genie en aber nicht eingesperrt auf dem podium zum gl ck kam schnell jemand und lie uns raus mein rennen lief gut beim start fuhr ich gut weg und die ersten runden war ich richtig schnell unterwegs dann sah ich das safety car und dachte oh nein nach dem restart konnte ich zwar in f hrung bleiben aber marco machte richtig druck auf der strecke lag viel schmutz und ein kleiner fahrfehler h tte mich beinahe platz eins gekostet marco versuchte anzugreifen blieb aber fair sonst w ren wir beide abgeflogen
499824 mein start lief nicht so gut ich verlor zwei pl tze nach der safety car phase lag ich hinter daniel ich versuchte ihn unter druck zu setzen und tats chlich machte er drei runden vor schluss einen kleinen fehler doch ein berholman ver war in der situation zu riskant ich dachte an die wichtigen punkte um in der gesamtwertung auf esteban und adrien aufzuschlie en
499825 von startplatz acht konnte ich gleich zu beginn auf position f nf vorfahren ich war schnell und wollte marco vor mir berholen aber wegen der gelben flaggen ging das nicht als ich nach dem vorfall zwischen adrien und esteban pl tzlich auf position drei lag freute ich mich das rennen war sehr gut aber auch schwierig ich fahre das erste jahr in einem formel bmw und die podiumsanw rter esteban adrien und marco absolvieren alle ihr zweites jahr in der serie umso mehr freue ich mich ber meinen erfolg
499826 he is going to double up thats certain i have just received confirmation from his coach glen mills
499827 it was clear that the coach was going to let him do it run both races we listen to our athletes and if he tells us he wants to run the double its up to us to organise the best programme for him
499828 we didnt take a lot from the game apart from the fact we were well beaten there are no excuses from our point of view
499829 overall liverpool were better and i have no complaints about the result
499830 from the start of the game we wanted to press and we wanted to win against a good team
499831 in the second half rangers needed to go forward in front of their supporters and they left more spaces and we have the quality to play the counter attack
499832 the ending the beginning is a cinch the world is full of great openings not so many great third acts

499890 fuimos pautados para estar a las 9 00 am del 16 de mayo de 2008 en el canal pero como no estuvieron disponibles los vi ticos bs f 23 para las tres comidas diarias terminamos saliendo a la 1 30 pm viajamos 17 horas y llegamos a las 6 30 am al campamento uribante caparo que quedaba a 4 horas del lugar del programa y que nos alojar a por tres d as
499891 descansamos apenas 3 horas y media y a las 10 00 am nos dirigimos al set a las 2 30 pm comenzamos el montaje terminamos a las 7 30 pm y regresamos al campamento a las 12 00 am para cenar y dormir
499892 dormimos 3 horas pues nos pidieron estar en el lugar de transmisi n antes de las 7 30 am
499893 nos dijeron que por motivos ajenos a venezolana de televisi n ya no se realizar a la transmisi n

499895 el exceso de horas no las producen los trabajadores sino la mala planificaci n
499896 el minci no tiene ese r gimen de horas extras la productora tampoco porque a ella le pagan por programa nosotros s y perdemos mucho tiempo por ejemplo en traslados tratando de llegar a lugares distantes
499897 si hubiese una mejor administraci n del tiempo y de los recursos generar horas extras no ser an tan intenso es una cuesti n de coordinaci n y de administraci n no pueden culpar a los trabajadores
499898 la gente sigue trabajando con la misma disposici n el mismo compromiso pero hay un malestar los trabajadores del canal piensan que no debi haber sido as que el presidente est desinformado o es que adrede se le da una informaci n manejada con una estructura totalmente diferente en el a o 2005 andr s izarra dec a las mismas palabras que el presidente repite ahora

499955 how did a steel town on lake erie attract one on the greatest classical musicians of the twentieth century and provide him with the conditions to do his greatest work leaving a legacy that lives on in the work of the orchestra and the musical culture of northern ohio to this day awesome
499956 ohio was a fairly large state in terms of geography from 1803 until the western states were organized it had a large population relatively speaking until fairly late in the 20th century its hardly surprising to find that a state which loomed so large in demographic terms contributed so heavily to the national culture
499957 either we accept zoning or we dont if we accept zoning for one social good we should accept it for all
499958 actually this is a zoning issue no one made the sale or purchase of fast food illegal
499959 before such policies are proposed and enacted a thorough study of how caloric content varies with prep time and input costs needs to be undertaken a mcdonalds double cheeseburger costing one dollar generates more revenue than a salad or chicken sandwich costing three to four times as much see warner 2006 additionally individuals are choosing to eat at fast food restaurants and thus restricting access to fatty high calorie meals may result in individual welfare losses readily available fast food both saves valuable time and increases obesity moving forward policy makers must consider how to make healthy food choices as affordable and quick as fast food finally the results suggest that individuals who plan transportation networks should consider the possible health impact of their decisions
499960 the results find no evidence of a causal link between restaurants and obesity and the estimates are precise enough to rule out any meaningful effect
499961 there is always someone who thinks that the reason that rich neighborhoods dont have businesses that are
499962 and finally the lack of fast food restaurants in wealthy neighborhoods has little to do with
499963 either we accept zoning or we dont if we accept zoning for one social good we should accept it for all
499964 of all tyrannies a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive it may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies the robber barons cruelty may sometimes sleep his cupidity may at some point be satiated but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience
499965 when i was student teaching we did a project where each student had to prepare a balanced dinner for their entire family for 1 per person this is roughly one 22 of what it costs to eat at mcdonalds seventh graders figured it out
499966 in my view what people objected to was not the for profit status of hmos per se but rather that they could be told they cant get all the care they want that view will remain thats one reason why covering 45 million or so additional americans will lead to rising rather than falling health care costs
499967 even in america with its faith in the free market people dont trust for profit corporations to make decisions about their health
499968 it somehow offends me a whole lot more knowing that my theoretical care was denied so that someone else could get richer make a profit
499969 im going to hospital x because its not for profit
499970 im not enrolling in hmo y because its one of those nasty for profits
499971 payment for comprehensive health care services on a prepaid per capita basis would greatly simplify national budgetary planning and would avoid most of the overhead costs
499972 market forces shape participants through both the wholesale and retail marketplace healthcare he believes also needs to figure out how to use both wholesale and retail market models and functionality in order to simultaneous improve quality and reduce prices
499973 he does not therefore advocate for a change to the way the insurance system is run but rather for increased consumer awareness about healthcare costs so as to create a dynamic market environment where low cost and high quality wins out much like any other competitive market driven economy
499974 if everyone were a proper libertarian household budget balancer like me
499975 now people of all income levels are buying small cars to pinch pennies at the gas pump but they are not scrimping on creature comforts instead they are spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars on options like heated leather seats and high end entertainment systems usually found in luxury cars
499976 if you do the math financially its not worth it
499977 but we figured if we buy something thats small and fun we can achieve some gas savings it just kills me personally when i take a ride by myself and im getting 10 miles to the gallon and i have nothing in the back
499978 people on my side of the issue should admit that we could lower overall health care costs or at least slow their rise by having a true single payer plan and putting most doctors on fixed salaries in small cooperatives
499979 obviously setting up a monopsony single buyer payer would lower overall cost of the product but must also lead to a shortage of the product provided care
499980 does any contender in the us system propose a true monopsony one which would dis allow supplemental private insurance cash and care or private doctors
499981 physician services accounted for 22 7 percent of total u s health spending in 1999 compared with 15 2 percent in the median oecd country
499982 even in america with its faith in the free market people dont trust for profit corporations to make decisions about their health
499983 the va has a rep as perhaps the finest health care system in the world and its physicians and nurses are government employees
499984 does universal health insurance make health care unaffordable lessons from taiwan
499985 people dont trust for profit corporations to make decisions about their health

499987 the experience weve had would certainly be a disincentive to any other companies that want to step in and put their entire business at risk

499989 they have not indicated to us that they are attempting to get out of our current contract
